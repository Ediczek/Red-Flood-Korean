RISING_FLOOD_DESC:0 "The world has descended further into darkness since the end of the Great War. With the collapse of the Western Front, the Russian Civil War, and the revolutions that swept most of Europe to radicalism, it seems as if the ideals of liberalism fought so dearly for in the First World War amounted to little in the face of the Futurists and the Councilists. Europe, and indeed the world, stand in a fragile balance, that may tip with the slightest of provocation..."

SETTING_SUN_DESC:0 "Ever since the demise of the KMT alliance, Asia has been consumed by chaos and strife. Warlords battle it out for who will be the true ruler of China, and across the Himalayas similar warlords fight over the destiny of India while the British desperately try to hold on. Meanwhile Japan consumed by it's own imperialism does not see the collapse of its nation swiftly approaching. The Sun is setting on many Empires, but will be rising on others..."
OTHER_THE_RISING_FLOOD_DESC:0 "Amid the chaos of the 20th Century there are many nations simply trying to survive the economic and ideological chaos. Some will have to pick a side in the coming conflict while others may choose their own paths."
