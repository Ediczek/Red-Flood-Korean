FCQ_fix_the_errors_of_1889_desc:0 "The 'Comissão verificadora de Poderes' is a government agency created on the aftermath of the 1889, being responsible to "verify" if the election of a candidate was legitimate, with the power to remove him if the comission wants to. For the last four decades such comission was responsible for keeping the sham democracy that poisoned Brazil, for locking the country on a never ending oligarchic dictatorship that lasted up until the civil war. As Salles policies seemed more lenient towards political dissidents over oligarchs, many members of the old class have judged him as another president they could exploit, and are awaiting to be bribed to ensure their loyalty, just waiting for a opportunity to betray him in the future. The time, however, had finally come, the time for a new age. According to the most recent proclamation published on the official government paper 'Diário Official', the Comissão Eleitoral will be abolished!"

The government shall proceed to create such instalations in our provisional capital until we can relocate to Rio. While these ministries won't be able to do much with our small budget, we expect them to be the beginning of what we be one day a functioning welfare state."

Some in the government claims that we do not have the money to pay everything we promise, but the problem will surely solve itself, right?"

FCQ_civic_identity_desc:0 "For years our governments have been drunk on foreign ideas of eugeny and of white superiority, being excludent with their own people, and some times even hostile. Our new republic on another hand understands that race must be a non factor on a ideal Brazil, and thus our people shall be considered not by their colour of skin, or family origin, but by their birth place, we are all brazilians, be native, white, black or asian, our diversity creates a huge diverse rainbow of colours that reflects the beauty of our people, and as such we must garantee that this new brazilian identity must be integrated on the hearts and minds of the people, even if we need to end racism with the force of arms."

Let the oligarchs, would be dictators and corrupt politicians tremble, as our boots shall unify Brazil from the furtherst amazonian forrests to the plans of the centerwest, the cities of the southeast and the cliffs of the south."

A new extensive land reform program shall be formulated by the government to redistribute the lands of the former oligarchs between the poor population, while the voting rights shall be expanded and election monitors shall be assigned to prevent more rigged elections, it's time to fight fire with fire, especially against the people that branded our people with iron during the slavery era."

The government shall grant funds to create a new industrial base through pará, starting from the Port of Belém through the tocantins and amazonas rivers. While a "miracle of the rhine" is unrealistic, and the project will be plagued with our lack of infraestruture and educated personal, we must remember that every single maraton starts with one single step."

While such economical gains increases the popularity of the new republic, the government pro democracy policies has also increased the people's political representation, we must expand these policies to garantee that the poorest person from the most isolated village have the same rights as the richest landowner on our capital."
FCQ_authentic_brazilian_nationalism:0 "Authentic Brazilian Nationalism"
FCQ_authentic_brazilian_nationalism_desc:0 "The USA is a federation because it was the union of 13 different colonies; Brazil is a federation because the dictator Deodoro copied the system. The USA is a republic because their new government didn't wanted to emulate the former one; brazil is a republic because our oligarchs wanted to copy the US form of government minus the democracy. The french elite is francophile because they were born in France; the brazilian elite is francophile because they visit Paris every year. For centuries our people has always copied what they saw outside, even our brazilian nationalists usually try to copy some of the fancy ideas they learned with the european radicals, and so we must break this precedent and formulate a true brazilian nationalism, a democratic and inclusive one, and garantee that creates a new generation hostile to foreign ideals, incompatible with our reality."
