BLR_DESC_MENU:0 "아타만 스타니스와프 부와크-바와호비츠의 봉토인 벨라루스는 교차로에 서있습니다. 국내의 수많은 파벌들이 각자의 이유로 아타만의 독재에 반대하고 있습니다. 민주정 지자파가 있는 한편 더 급진적인 이념과 반동독재를 지지하는 이들도 있습니다. 벨라루스를 제2의 사회주의 혁명의 등대로 만들려는 지도부를 가진 벨라루스 정보국 내 파벌들이 있고, 벨라루스를 뭔가 다른 것으로 변화시키려는 사악한 외인 장교들이 있으며, 언제나 그렇듯 마련된 광인의 자리가 있지만 그들의 진정한 목적은 아직 알 수 없습니다. 누가 망하고 흥할 것이며, 누가 벨라루스를 불확실한 미래로 이끌 것이란 말입니까?"

#CUSTOM TOOLTIPS AND FLAGS#
#DECISIONS (1.5 Update)#
#FOCUSES#
BLR_fiefdom_ataman:0 "아타만의 봉토"
BLR_fiefdom_ataman_desc:0 "러시아의 통치가 무너진 이래 벨라루스 지역은 아타만이 이끌어왔습니다. 민주정인 우크라이나나 리투아니아, 혹은 (원수 숭배를 동반한) 폴란드와 다르게, 진짜 독재국가인 벨라루스는 단 한 사람, 아타만만의 무쇠와 같은 의지로서 통치파벌이 권력을 잡고 있습니다."
BLR_review_military:0 "Review Military Budget"
BLR_review_military_desc:0 "A rather routine task, military budget reviewing is done every year to decide what should be done to keep the military of Belarus alive."
BLR_review_civilian:0 "Reviewing Civilian Budget"
BLR_review_civilian_desc:0 "Not to be outdone, various civilian groups of influence kowtow to Ataman no less often than the military industrialists, because state can’t spend all money on the military, civilian budget also must be reviewed."
BLR_power_struggle:0 "권력투쟁"
BLR_power_struggle_desc:0 "Fortunately, the budget accounting is complete. Unfortunately, it became apparent that neither our public nor our military are monolithic, with so many factions existing - and all of them being against Ataman in their power struggle."
BLR_watch_out_polish:0 "Watch out for Polish"
BLR_watch_out_polish_desc:0 "Poland may be our ally, not to mention the leader of Intermarium, but their influence has become more and more of an obstacle to Belarusian superiority. We should be wary both of Polish troops stationed near our borders, of diplomats scheming in Minsk, and of exiled Polish officers who often have close ties with Belarusian high society and, most concerning, our military. This simply can’t continue as it is."
BLR_question_constitution:0 "헌법 문제"
BLR_question_constitution_desc:0 "Belarus is a Republic. This is clear. But due to a chain of unfortunate events, our constitutional project was never finished, power of Ataman being legally de-facto unrestricted. Shall we write a proper Constitution, or let the Ataman govern as he wishes?"
BLR_purge_or_not_purge:0 "숙청할 것인가 말 것인가"
BLR_purge_or_not_purge_desc:0 "When observing the petty conflicts of multitude of factions, Ataman’s closest advisors, including the secret intelligence units of Asobny Atrad, recommended to purge the enemies of Belarus in one swift move. But would the Ataman even do it, granted how those who would be purged include not just power-hungry officers or insignificant criminals, but intellectuals and scientists as well? Or will he cleanse the apparatus of the state without showing any remorse to cement his power?"
BLR_eternal_dictator:0 "불멸의 독재"
BLR_eternal_dictator_desc:0 "Stanislaw’s enemies were crushed, none dare to oppose him. It can be said with full certainty, that the Ataman reigns supreme, the dictatorship in Belarus is going to be eternal."
BLR_one_way_or_another:0 "다른 길은 없다..."
BLR_one_way_or_another_desc:0 "While it is tempting to say that Ataman may get away with the way he restricts civil liberties, allows his cronies to abuse the system, and overall behaves like a bandit, some voices in Belarusian society pray, that one way or another, the dictatorship comes to end. But what kind of system will come to power instead?"

BLR_belarussian_democracy:0 "벨라루스 민주정"
BLR_belarussian_democracy_desc:0 "Finally, after a historic compromise, Belarus is a democracy. Politics were opened up for new parties, people feel less oppressed than anytime before, but this is not the end of our struggle. It is only beginning."
BLR_parliamentary_elections:0 "의회선거"
BLR_parliamentary_elections_desc:0 "To accomplish the civic society’s aspirations, Belarus must elect its Rada. Two parties contend - BSH and BNP, the later is also torn between the more mainstream Conservatives and the Liberals of Kreczeuski. The people decide, and tomorrow we’ll know who will lead our nation as its first democratically elected President."
BLR_bsh_coalition:0 "BSH 주도 연정"
BLR_bsh_coalition_desc:0 "The Biełaruskaja Satsijalistychnaja Hramada, or Belarusian Socialist Assembly has attracted the more Liberal elements of BNP, forming a centre-left coalition as a result. Despite \"Socialist\" in its name, BSH is moderately Social Democratic, and will surely make society of Belarus just, and its welfare system - existing not just on paper."
BLR_bnp_coalition:0 "BNP 주도 연정"
BLR_bnp_coalition_desc:0 "The Biełaruskaja Niezaležnickaja Partyja, or Belarusian Independence Party has united both its Liberal and Conservative members around a single goal - upholding independence of Belarusian Democratic Republic, and introducing a more just yet even more capitalist system, compatible with existing Belarusian society."
BLR_welfare_state:0 "복지국가"
BLR_welfare_state_desc:0 "BSH promises the citizens of Belarus adequate living conditions, mandatory health insurance and other stuff known in the more civilized countries as \"welfare\". By making this promises a reality, Belarus will surely catch up to the better developed states."
BLR_human_rights:0 "인권 보호"
BLR_human_rights_desc:0 "So many groups - beginning with intellectuals and ending with minorities - faced discrimination and abuse from the Ataman’s forces back when that brute was in power. But our Human Rights Court will prevent such disgrace from occurring ever again."
BLR_deregulation:0 "비규제"
BLR_deregulation_desc:0 "The old undemocratic government did a lot to regulate our economy, thinking it’s protecting the people that way, but in truth they only opened an avenue to cheaper Polish products, effectively rendering our entrepreneurship disadvantaged. We must deal with this problem - by conducting deregulation, and freeing the humble businessmen of Belarusian nation from the bureaucrat’s grip."
BLR_patriotic_education:0 "애국교육"
BLR_patriotic_education_desc:0 "Our children must be educated, but what should they learn? Obviously, the good Belarusian values and the price our patriots must be ready to pay for the people’s prosperity."
BLR_lift_censorship:0 "언론검열 해제"
BLR_lift_censorship_desc:0 "As of today, there’s no reason to impose any restrictions on our writers’ and editors’ creativity. Let the free press exist!"
BLR_better_belarus:0 "더 나은 벨라루스"
BLR_better_belarus_desc:0 "You wouldn’t believe us, the tales we could tell, although, truth be told...it started very poorly. But the Great Apostate - the Usurper, the Ataman - is now no longer an active figure in politics, and as such he doesn’t object to the grand transformation that Belarus underwent. One would think - \"Could a country which was under a dictatorial rule for thirteen years change in merely a year?\". We are an example of such rapid change. Belarusian Democratic Republic is a much better country to live than ever before, and who knows, maybe other Belarusians will follow its lead one day."

BLR_foreign_clique:0 "외인파 음모"
BLR_foreign_clique_desc:0 "What many thought was unthinkable, what was so many times denied and debunked both by Belarusians and by the Polish, something simply nonsensical to so many people, finally happened. Gone is the power of Ataman, now a clique of adventurous foreigners holds the power - through their many connections in the Belarusian military, through intimidation of opponents and overall lack of opposition. The ship of state is now controlled by people indifferent to the fate of the common folk, but with the entire country at their disposal - for whatever sinister purpose it may be."
BLR_invite_uladzimir:0 "울라지미르 키릴라비치의 민스크 초청"
BLR_invite_uladzimir_desc:0 "Granted how understandably low is new clique’s legitimacy, it was decided one day after the lunch that monarchy would be the best form of transforming Belarus according to the new leadership’s wishes, and as such a Romanov was invited to Minsk - duke Vladimir Kirillovich, the legitimate successor to Russian throne, whose father however was exiled to Britain and felt a strong disdain towards Kolchak’s Russia, disdain only strengthened in his son. Vladimir replied to a letter of Tinz with an enthusiastic three-page response, describing how he would be eager to take command, and that he already started learning Belarusian language. So far, it’s all going just as planned."
BLR_ruthenian_empire:0 "루테니아 제국 선언"
BLR_ruthenian_empire_desc:0 "With Uladzimir’s plane arriving safely to Minsk, veil of secrecy was torn, and to the shocked world an announcement was made - no longer Belarus will be a leaderless cripple of a nation, a new sovereign, a new Emperor will lead the White Ruthenians towards their glory, - Ruthenian Empire is here, and no amount of enemies will stop it from its destiny!"
BLR_manifesto:0 "제국선언 발표"
BLR_manifesto_desc:0 "Proclamation of our Empire was met with somewhat better public response than we expected, but it was also met with confusion - both domestically and abroad. After all, what business does a Romanov and a bunch of Polish and Russian officers have in Belarus, creating what many would think of as an \"unnatural country\". Which means, that in order to better explain what do we stand for, and what policies will our state pursue, an Imperial Manifesto must be published, showing to the world that we indeed have a purpose."
BLR_five_races:0 "일휘오족"
BLR_five_races_desc:0 "민족주의자들과 다르게 우리는 어떤 인종도 우월하거나 열등하다 말하지 않습니다. Granted our Empire’s historically diverse and vibrant population, we uphold the notion that our Empire must be built by five races, all sharing common destiny in the lands of Ruthenia: White Ruthenians, Muscovites, Polish people, Lipka Tatars and Ashkenazi Jews. These groups have a bond, forged by blood, which entitles them to equal rights under our rule, protection from discrimination and a reason to be loyal to Ruthenian Empire. The banner of Five Races shall rise over Ruthenian land, now its meaning clear to all!"
BLR_claimant_of_rus:0 "옛 루스의 유일한 주장자"
BLR_claimant_of_rus_desc:0 "As a true Ruthenian state, we trace our origins to the ancient polity of Rus’, established by foreign adventurers with assistance of local Slavs - just like our Empire, basically. We won’t wait for our rivals to disappear - we will force that event to come sooner, because there could be only one true heir to Rurik’s domain."
BLR_reform_imperial_army:0 "제국군 개혁"
BLR_reform_imperial_army_desc:0 "While Belarus had a relatively decent military, it wasn’t strong enough even to keep our borders safe. As we are preparing for Imperial conquest, it is absolutely necessary to reform our troops, agitate our people so that they join the Imperial Army, and research new weapons to gain an upper hand over the false Rus."
BLR_entrench_monarchy:0 "절대군주정 강화"
BLR_entrench_monarchy_desc:0 "Uladzimir may not tolerate such things as parliamentarism or free elections, but his benevolence allows him to be our supreme ruler, our absolute monarch, our sovereign by whose grace the five races have received their privileges and Ruthenia as a whole received her purpose. Which means that while the original clique still serves him as advisors, in public he must be perceived as an undeniable sovereign."
BLR_finland_to_japan:0 "핀란드에서 일본까지"
BLR_finland_to_japan_desc:0 "When we were talking about expanding Ruthenia to match our claim of being an Empire, we weren’t joking - all lands once held by our Emperor’s dynasty, from Helsinki to Vladivostok, must be brought under the Imperial flag, local population assimilated into either of our races and all resistance to realization of Ruthenia’s destiny crushed."
BLR_ruthenia_stands:0 "루테니아 제국의 개선"
BLR_ruthenia_stands_desc:0 "Those who ridiculed us today no longer feel confident in their judgement, because what our Emperor and his advisors promised to Ruthenian people is delivered to them - for after a truly heroic struggle, Ruthenian destiny is realized, \"five races banner\" hoisted over the Muscovite towns, Imperial forces crushing the remaining resistance from the Baltic to the Pacific. It is time to offer a toast - to the thousand year Empire of Ruthenia!"

BLR_pale_horse:0 "창백한 말"
BLR_pale_horse_desc:0 "손 담근 이 하나 없었건만 그 결과가 이제 여기 있습니다. 보리스 사빈코프, 러시아 근래사에 가장 악명 높은 테러리스트, 사회주의 혁명당의 "우익" 이념가이자 실질 지도자, 우연찮게 별동분견대에서 한직을 얻게 된 자가 이제 벨라루스 전역에 대한 통치를 선언하며 진정한 첫 사회주의 대통령에 취임했습니다. 대중은 충격에 빠졌습니다. 이미 이름난 사빈코프였으나, 저산의 진정한 모국에서 추방된 세월 동안 그의 악질은 더 심해졌습니다. 하지만 더 이상 할 수 있는 건 없습니다. 창백한 말이 여기에 있으니, 가장 현명한 자만이 동유럽에서 무슨 일이 벌어질지 예측할 수 있을 것입니다."
BLR_approach_terrorists:0 "테러리스트파를 향한 접근"
BLR_approach_terrorists_desc:0 "모든 사회주의 혁명파가 펜과 크레용에 빠진 채 폭탄과 리볼버를 놓은 건 아닙니다. A rather sinister faction of terrorist SRs had refused back then in 1924 to join Belarusian Secret Intelligence, but now these old sharp-shooters can be useful again - against Russian Empire, against the evil of Kolchak."
BLR_negotiation_partisants:0 "유격대와의 협상"
BLR_negotiation_partisants_desc:0 "While a great deal of our comrades in the spy community supported the SR cause, a faction of secret agents and their paramilitary goons called "Partisans" refused to listen to Savinkov’s orders, instead preferring to lie low in Pripyat marshes. However, by talking with their rather Reactionary, but professional leader, our chief Boris Savinkov will try to bring those brigands back under control."
BLR_contacts_acephale:0 "아세팔 접촉"
BLR_contacts_acephale_desc:0 "도덕관점에서도 좋은 놈들은 아닌 데다, 우리식 사회주의만이 아닌 사회주의 전체에 회의적인 입장이라곤 해도, 아세팔이라면 자신들의 무기, 퇴폐적이긴 해도 자신들의 생활방식을 싼값이 쥐어주며 유격대란 어떻게 행동해야 하는가를 보여줄 수 있습니다. 놈들의 이념이나 예술적 취향에는 관심 없습니다. 진정 신경써야 할 건 프랑스 지도부에 대한, 유럽의 누구보다 쉽게 독일과 폴란드를 거쳐 벨라루스로 밀수를 수행해줄 놈들의 영향력입니다."
BLR_war_with_kolchakocracy:0 "콜차크정의 절멸을 위한 전쟁"
BLR_war_with_kolchakocracy_desc:0 "Now, when all influence is ours, the troops are ready, the infiltrators have crossed the border and weapons have been stockpiled in advance, we can denounce the counterrevolutionaries completely and declare an all-out war on Russian leadership, continuing it even if the Admiral won’t lead those thugs anymore."
BLR_destroy_populist:0 "대중주의 선동 파쇄"
BLR_destroy_populist_desc:0 "We can’t be sure of our land’s integrity and of our people’s loyalty until they are not properly indoctrinated, until there exists such thing as various bourgeois parties, using populism and demagoguery to distract the Belarusian people from the true goal - from triumph of socialism."
BLR_unite_revolutionaries:0 "사회주의 혁명당 단결"
BLR_unite_revolutionaries_desc:0 "사회주의 혁명당이 콜차크의 잔혹성 앞에 분쇄되었어도 사라진 건 아니었습니다. 여기에 파벌 하나, 저기에 파벌 하나, 그리고 황러시아에 재건된 당 전체가 있지만, 단결만이 승리를 보장하니, 여기 벨라루스에서 러시아 SR, 벨라루스 SR, 테러리스트 SR과 비슷한 생각을 가진 좌익 등 모든 파벌들을 다시금 하나의 당으로 통합해야 합니다."
BLR_introduce_agrarian_socialism:0 "농업사회주의"
BLR_introduce_agrarian_socialism_desc:0 "In order to keep the Belarusian rural population calm, we shall proceed with long-promised agrarian reforms, effectively granting the villagers their long deserved autonomy, land of remaining nobles socialized and every village having its own peasants’ council. That way, people of Belarus will be less likely to complain."
BLR_industrialization:0 "살인 목적의 산업화"
BLR_industrialization_desc:0 "촌락들이 우리의 곡창지이자 인력원이 되어주는 한편, 읍과 도시들은 당의 산업당국 아래 놓여져, 크게 쓸모가 없는 민간산업 대신 군사산업에 집중해야 합니다. 우리 혁명의 외부의 적을 소거하는 것보다 더 높은 목적은 없습니다!"
BLR_arms_trade:0 "무기거래"
BLR_arms_trade_desc:0 "If we are to achieve the satisfaction for what Kolchak’s brutes did to our Revolution, we must show indifference towards the more secondary aspects of socialistic doctrine, and dive into the world of illegal arms shipments and black market - end justifies the means, and it is better to control the illegal trade yourself than let the counterrevolutionaries do it instead."
BLR_no_mercy:0 "무자비한 자들을 향한 무자비"

After hours of debate, looking at his watch, our Ataman said-"

Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz looked at the papers provided by agent and asked:\n-Estimated productivity loss as a result of purge?\n-No more than 1%, Your Excellency! - replied the officer.\nThinking about what to do, whether to choose security or mercy, old ruler of Belarus muttered:"

belarus.3.t:0 "What now?"
belarus.3.desc:0 "With a report by intelligence on his desk and a bottle of wine in his hand, Ataman was brooding. He was thinking about what to do now, after so many years of desperate governance, and after so many tiresome nights of managing the country which stood at the edge of doom. Suddenly, door to his room was opened, and a compound butler walked in, saying that there are two letters \"for His Excellency\" - one from Lastouski, detailing a proposal for meeting in Rada building concerning the unsolved constitutional debate, and one from Kostecki, a rather eccentric Polish-Belarusian officer who was engaged in writing popular science fiction books. Upon reading both letters, the Ataman said:"
belarus.3.a:0 "Oh, Kostecki’s inviting? Okay, send for the driver, we’re going to Albin’s restaurant at Brunon’s invitation."

From now on, I resign due to a superior form of governance being borne in our mutual debates as their consequence."

All three cars belonged to people who were currently in a pompous restaurant located not far from the city centre of Minsk, all three persons were invited by a somewhat eccentric war veteran Eugeniusz Tinz, who currently was sitting together with his guests, waiting for tartar and beer to be served after a good serving of barszcz and roasted duck. \nBałachowicz, Tinz, Vituška and Savinkov were all sitting at that table, and discussing various things not concerning the matters of the state. After all, life was good enough even without all of that, and the very atmosphere of a peaceful cafe didn’t in any way force the four warriors of Belarus to worry about anything. Suddenly, Bułak-Bałachowicz noticed that the host was not at ease. Before he could do anything..."

Together, they sat in the car - not theirs, but in the Ataman’s limousine, and drove towards the government borough. When a guard tried to stop them at the checkpoint, they quickly bribed him and drove further. Upon disembarking, Tinz sent for his agent at the nearby telegraphy post, and told him to send a short message to Juliusz and to Dolgorukov: \"Phase One is complete.\"\nUnopposed, Eugeniusz and his assistant broke into the sealed headquarters room of Bułak-Bałachowicz. There, retired Polish officer sat in the Ataman’s chair, took a sheet and a pen, and said to himself before starting writing a letter:"

Looking around himself, Boris Savinkov brushes away blood on his tuxedo and puts the revolver back in its holster. At last, with aid of his men and women in the secret intelligence of Belarusian Republic, he could be at the centre of power. Everything must be devoted to a single goal - revenge on Kolchak and his disgusting lapdogs, and triumph of the Socialist Revolution. The Spartacists may claim that the Revolution was false, that it didn’t go far enough - but they’re too blind to see the nature of evil that was plaguing Russia. Only with the Belarusians’ help, could the snake be cut into pieces. Only with the total and unconditional devotion both of the army, the people, and the nation’s dark knights, the Asobny Atrad, to the revolutionary cause, could the victory be secured. Savinkov looked at himself in the mirror and, being sure that nobody was watching, erupted in a diabolical laughter.

A middle-aged school teacher from Minsk, Aleksandr Bogdanov, has gathered a group of followers, from all kinds of backgrounds, who were swiftly organizing some sort of improvised cult, which disturbingly enough had some similarities in its ideology both with Zadruga and with the old Bolsheviks, albeit with a rather esoteric twist. Nevertheless, a brief report by the new dictator’s henchman indicated that the situation is more or less under control."

Nonetheless, our spirituality always centered around a divine being, which however didn’t preserve any of our ancestors from being subjugated. However, with each defeat and conquest, our people haven’t perished - because from a more detached point of view, we were like the Lazarus of Abrahamic faith. ‘And he cried in a loud voice, ‘'Lazarus, come forth!'’ And Lazarus did arise from the grave’ - was said there. Even though that could be said if we separate the people from their blood-soken soil, which meanwhile draws another parallel - with that of Nod, thus making everyone here a Cain’s descendant. But let not the past frighten you - for the foreseeable future, comrades, I am the future, and the future I promise is the one in which the esoteric terror of our past shall be overthrown by the Belarusian collective will! No longer shall we stand aside as all progressive nations try making their own national Gods - be they named ‘ideology’, ‘creed’ or according to the most venerated personality. None of those spiritual according to their nation movements, none of those political religions are going to help our Motherland. However - if we create our own God, who will turn this Nod into Eden, who will be more bright than Elohim of the old scriptures and undeniably native to Belarus in spirit - then our victory will be assured.

I will not describe to you, colleagues, all over again, we do not have much time - but we have almost reached the point. \nA hoarse voice is accompanied by the sound of indistinct muttering from a gramophone \n... The fact of the existence of a special form of time and space described by the legendary academician Vernadsky has long been experimentally confirmed ... \nThe doctor quietly lowers the needle of the syringe, silently it pierces the parchment. Cold gray steel. \n... which he called the \"noosphere.\" Mr. Vernadsky described it as a sum ... - the voice pauses, - as a sum of all understandings, ideas, and thoughts known to mankind. \nThe syringe is quickly replaced by a system, a long bundle of orange rubber tubes, but before that one or more drops of crimson still have time to drip on the skin. So red they seem unrealistic. The Elohim frown. \n... We went further, colleagues. What if the noosphere - this treasury of humanity - is not just a closed room, but a platform for experiments? - the rustling of voices grows, merging with the noise of the gramophone. - Imagine the potential that opens before us, colleagues ... \nThe system is installed, and the crimson flows, shines, through the soulless rubber, filling with life all that plexus of tubes and vessels. Here is magic, the alchemical process of transformation and purification, precipitation and dissolution, filtration, and movement. The philosopher's stone of the soul, sealed in five liters of plasma and iron. \n... Humanity must play an active role in the noosphere, but - pause - the most important thing is that this role must be meaningful! No more suffering - we will erase them with the power of our mind, the power of our soul. No more evil - we will destroy the very notion of evil.

Mixing, distilling, purifying… \nOutside the window, the quiet rumble of cars and the whisper of leaves suddenly reaches an overcast intensity, and then the chandelier above his head explodes like a new sun. \n... we create God for ourselves… \nFive people, united by one circulatory system, watch the pulsating sun under the ceiling, and this sun pulsates in rhythm to the beat of their hearts. \n... collective self, ideal person… \nFive take an inaudible step forward, and dozens of others emerge from the fog - there is no more room, no more hospital, but boundless, boundless psychological workshop, where the proletarians of the new, Hemo-psychic era build their God, build themselves.

The third party rarely mentioned in public discourse, but which has successfully infiltrated the Asobny Atrad, Belarusian secret service, is PSR, led by militant socialist Boris Savinkov. His grip over the organization is not absolute however, since another faction in Belarusian secret service, the Black Cats, is dominated by reactionary NNP, with its rather weird aims of returning Belarus to a pre-Commonwealth age. \nFinally, one shouldn’t underestimate the madmen - neither the sinister foreign cliques plotting their schemes in the shadows of rural mansions, nor a certain school teacher with a troubled, Bolshevik past - for all of them will try to achieve power, no matter the cost."
