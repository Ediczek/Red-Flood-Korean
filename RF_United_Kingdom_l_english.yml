#BOOKMARKS#
UNITED_KINGDOM_DESC:0 "대전쟁의 승자 영국은 수많은 젊은이들의 도살로 이 승리의 값을 치렀습니다. 피투성이가 된 영국은 떠올라, 1920년대에 적대국들에게 위협받지 않는 세계 유일의 초강대국으로 번영했습니다. 1931년의 총파업과 수상의 암살은 이 모든 것을 무너뜨리고 1934년의 경제 붕괴와 뒤이어 "대공황"으로 이어졌습니다. 왕국은 나약하니, 수많은 태양이 져가는 바로 그 제국이 왕국의 주요 약점 중 하나가 되었습니다. 선거가 3월로 예정된 가운데, 많은 사람들은 새 정부가 나라를 구할 수 있을지에 대해 궁금해 하고 있습니다."

#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
politics_edward_viii_desc:0 "영국과 대영제국 자치령들의 왕인 에드워드 8세는 1927년 11월 패혈증 투병 끝에 승하한 아버지 조지 5세의 뒤를 이어 왕위에 올랐습니다. 그의 통치하에서 영국은 권력의 정점에 도달했고 그 후 아서 헨더슨 수상의 암살, 런던 주식시장의 붕괴와 영국령 인도의 붕괴로 쇠퇴했습니다. 에드워드는 간통 스캔들과 급진적 운동에 대한 정치적 동정심 때문에 영국 정부에 방해가 되었습니다. 정부는 그의 전 정부인 셀마 퍼니스와의 결혼을 희망했지만, 에드워드는 그의 오랜 방식을 계속 이어갔습니다. 에드워드의 통치는 정부가 에드워드로부터 얼마나 많은 것을 기꺼이 받아들이고 그가 얼마나 그들을 밀어붙이는가에 달려 있습니다."

ENG_edward_viii:0 "에드워드 8세"
ENG_edward_viii_desc:0 "영국과 대영제국 자치령들의 왕인 에드워드 8세는 1927년 11월 패혈증 투병 끝에 승하한 아버지 조지 5세의 뒤를 이어 왕위에 올랐습니다. 그의 통치하에서 영국은 권력의 정점에 도달했고 그 후 아서 헨더슨 수상의 암살, 런던 주식시장의 붕괴와 영국령 인도의 붕괴로 쇠퇴했습니다. 에드워드는 간통 스캔들과 급진적 운동에 대한 정치적 동정심 때문에 영국 정부에 방해가 되었습니다. 정부는 그의 전 정부인 셀마 퍼니스와의 결혼을 희망했지만, 에드워드는 그의 오랜 방식을 계속 이어갔습니다. 에드워드의 통치는 정부가 에드워드로부터 얼마나 많은 것을 기꺼이 받아들이고 그가 얼마나 그들을 밀어붙이는가에 달려 있습니다."
ENG_economic_catastrophe:0 "경제 재앙"
ENG_economic_catastrophe_desc:0 "1931년 총파업과 그 뒤를 이은 런던 주식시장 붕괴로 경제는 완전히 황폐화되고 있습니다. 실업률이 치솟았고, 빈곤과 인플레이션도 빠른 속도로 증가하고 있습니다. 정부의 비효율적인 개입은 경제를 마비 상태로 만들었고 경제적 피해를 복구하기 위해서는 추가적인 변화가 필요합니다."
ENG_divided_nation:0 "분열된 국가"
ENG_divided_nation_desc:0 "국가가 불안정함에 따라 좌파와 우파 대중 운동이 지지를 받고 있으며, 키보 키프트의 녹색 셔츠단과 같은 준군사조직들이 거리에서 싸우고 있습니다. 이러한 운동이 계속해서 인기를 끌면서 나라의 안정성을 위협하는 상황이 되었으므로 이제는 이를 끝내야 합니다."
ENG_imperial_eclipse:0 "제국의 쇠퇴"
ENG_imperial_eclipse_desc:0 "우리의 경제와 정치 위기로 제국은 감당을 할 수 없었고 구조는 썩어갔으며 영국령 인도의 운명에서 보듯이 밑으로 무너졌습니다. "
ENG_shadow_of_the_somme:0 "솜 전투의 그림자"
ENG_shadow_of_the_somme_desc:0 "대전쟁에서 승리를 거두었지만 피해는 엄청났습니다. 특히 솜 전투는 우리나라에 깊은 상처를 남겼습니다. 국민 대다수가 미래의 전쟁에 반대하고 군사적 반감은 항상 높기 때문에 신병은 항상 적습니다."

#DECISIONS (1.5 Update)#
#FOCUSES#
ENG_Royal_Rearmament_Program:0 "왕실 재무장 프로그램"
ENG_Royal_Rearmament_Program_desc:0 "세계의 불안정이 커지고 있는 가운데 영국과 제국이 스스로를 방어할 유일한 희망은 군대를 재무장하는 것입니다. 프랑스와 독일, 러시아의 악어가 우리를 잡아먹게 기다리며 앉아 있을 수 없습니다. 우리는 재무장이 영국인들에게 얼마나 인기가 없든지 간에 시작해야만 합니다."
ENG_BEF:0 "영국 원정군 개선"
ENG_BEF_desc:0 "혹시나 우리가 벌이게 될 전쟁은 다시 유럽 대륙에서 벌어질 것입니다. 대중들이 전쟁을 필요로 하지 않을지 모르지만, 다시 벌어질 전쟁은 오래 갈 것입니다. 다시 한번 우리 자신을 방어해야 할 수도 있습니다."
ENG_Walkie_Talkie:0 "워키토키를 사용한 실험"
ENG_Walkie_Talkie_desc:0 "워키토키는 장거리 통신이 가능한 흥미로운 도구입니다. 이것은 우리에게 매우 가치 있는 것으로 전장의 통신을 전보다 빠르게 해줍니다. 불과 수십 년 전만 해도 전신선과 배달부에 의존했습니다. 이제 우리는 더 빨리 의사소통 할 수 있습니다."
ENG_Intergrate_Bren:0 "브렌 경기관총 통합"
ENG_Intergrate_Bren_desc:0 "새로 개발된 브렌 경기관총은 효과적인 무기입니다. 이것을 영국군과 영연방군 내에 통합하는 것은 아군의 현대화와 재무장에 도움이 될 것입니다. 그들을 전 세계에 걸쳐 우리의 적들을 무찌를 수 있는 더 효과적인 전투부대가 되게 하는 것입니다."
ENG_radio_tower_calais:0 "칼레에 레이더 구축"
ENG_radio_tower_calais_desc:0 "우리의 유일한 유럽 대륙 내 본토인 칼레는 프랑스와 독일을 은밀한 방식으로 감시할 수 있는 훌륭한 장소이며, 그들의 대규모 움직임에 대해 경고해줄 수 있습니다. 우리는 이제 레이더 기지의 건설을 승인할 것입니다."
ENG_Motorisation_efforts:0 "차량화 효과"
ENG_Motorisation_efforts_desc:0 "보병은 참호족에 취약하고 우천시에 비참한 상태가 될 뿐만 아니라, 느리기까지 합니다. 하지만, 우리가 트럭에 몇 명의 분대를 투입한다면, 우리는 훨씬 더 많은 기동성을 가지게 됩니다. 평원을 가로질러 속도를 내서, 병사들이 철조망을 막지 못하게 합니다."
ENG_learn_somme:0 "솜 전투에서의 학습"
ENG_learn_somme_desc:0 "솜 전투에서 우리는 너무 많은 잘못을 저질렀습니다. 많은 사람들이 무의미하게 죽었습니다. 그것은 우리 아들들에게 직면했던 가장 큰 군사적 재앙이며, 이를 예방할 수 있게 이해하는 것이 중요합니다."
ENG_fullers_plan:0 "풀러의 계획"
ENG_fullers_plan_desc:0 "풀러의 계획은 전선에 빠르고 강력한 공격을 촉진하기 위해 적의 방어망을 산산조각 내고 그들의 주변을 돌면서 전차와 기계화된 보병의 중용하는 것입니다." 
ENG_hart_plan:0 "하츠의 계획"
ENG_hart_plan_desc:0 "하츠는 가장 좋은 계획은 더 나은 계획을 세우는 것이라고 믿습니다. 라디오, 모든 수준의 의사소통, 우리 군대와 제국의 주제 간의 조정, 대영제국은 전장의 끊임없는 라디오 신호의 불꽃에 휩싸일 것입니다."
ENG_brooke_plan:0 "브룩의 플랜"
ENG_brooke_plan_desc:0 "왜 대전쟁 때 그렇게 많은 사람들이 죽었습니까? 경험의 부족 때문입니다. 징집병들은 포격을 받아 땅에 박히고 맥심 기관총 앞에 고깃덩이가 되었습니다. 이제 더 이상은 어떻게 싸울지 몰라서는 안됩니다. 어떻게 은폐하고, 어떻게 걷고, 어떻게 죽는지 배웠습니다."
ENG_marine_core:0 "해병대 지원금"
ENG_marine_core_desc:0 "해병대는 우리 해군 계획의 중요한 부분이 될 것입니다. 필요하면 해협을 가로질러, 바다를 가로질러 신속하게 대응할 수 있도록, 확장되고 훨씬 더 잘 만들어져야 합니다."
ENG_landing_craft:0 "상륙정 개선"
ENG_landing_craft_desc:0 "우리의 병사들을 목적지까지 헤엄쳐 가기를 바랄 수 없습니다. 상륙정을 새로 설계해서 우리 병사들이 무엇보다도 안전하게 해변에 도착하도록 만들어야 합니다."
ENG_experiment_tank:0 "전차 실험"
ENG_experiment_tank_desc:0 "대전쟁 때의 전차는 제한되었었습니다. 마크 V는 훌륭한 전차지만 낡았습니다. 우리는 더 새롭고 더 나은 디자이너들과 함께 실험해야합니다."
ENG_mechanization_effort:0 "기계화 효과"
ENG_mechanization_effort_desc:0 "트럭은 당신을 잘 데려다 줄 수 있지만 장갑이 없으면 전쟁터에서 위험이 큽니다. 장갑을 추가하고 병력 수송 장갑차를 만들어서 가능한 한 피해를 적게 받고, 전방에 아군을 배치해야 합니다."
ENG_nottingham_tank:0 "노팅엄 기갑 학교"
ENG_nottingham_tank_desc:0 "큰 조직에는 장교가 필요한데, 우리는 연대 규모 이상의 기갑 부대는 없었습니다. 사단 규모의 기갑 부대는 어떻게 해야 할까요? 보병 장교들은 그 임무를 맡지 못하기 때문에, 특정 학교를 설립해야 합니다."
ENG_automobile_manufacturers:0 "자동차 제조업체와 협력"
ENG_automobile_manufacturers_desc:0 "자동차 제조업체들은 민간 시장에 더 관심을 가질지 모릅니다. 하지만 우리에겐 그들이 절실히 필요하기 때문에 그들에게 그들이 우리의 요구를 채울 수 있다는 것을 이해시켜야 합니다. "
ENG_intergration_tank_warfare:0 "기갑전 교리 통합"
ENG_intergration_tank_warfare_desc:0 "기갑전은 영국 교리에 통합되어야 합니다. 빠르며, 단단하고, 커다란 전차들은 들판을 누비고, 나무를 부수며 철조망을 비웃고, 사격 진지를 박살내고 참호를 쉽게 건넙니다. 영국 병사들은 참호 점령을 더 이상 걱정하지 않을 것입니다. 우리의 전차는 모든 적들에게 달려갈 것이기 때문입니다!"
ENG_invest_radio:0 "라디오에 투자"
ENG_invest_radio_desc:0 "라디오는 아름다운 것입니다. 거의 기적에 가까운 야전에서의 진보입니다. 만약 우리가 군용 라디오 제작을 돕기 위해 라디오 회사에 정부 보조금을 제공한다면 결코 적에게 뒤쳐지지 않을 것입니다."
ENG_empire_wide_communications:0 "온 제국을 걸친 소통"
ENG_empire_wide_communications_desc:0 "캐나다, 호주, 말레이 등 전 세계에서 온 군인들이 있습니다. 모든 영토를 가로 지르는 병사들 간의 지휘 구조와 의사소통을 공식화하는 것은 전쟁 기간 동안 우리에게 큰 헤택을 줄 것입니다."
ENG_tank_marines:0 "해병대 전차"
ENG_tank_marines_desc:0 "전차는 보병만의 도구는 아닙니다. 해변에 상륙하는 것은 항상 위험하며, 우리 해병들은 도움이 필요할 것입니다. 수륙 양용으로 제작된 장갑차, 전차는 유럽 해변에 우리의 병사들을 보낼 때 유용할 것입니다."
ENG_modify_production_lines:0 "생산 라인 조정"
ENG_modify_production_lines_desc:0 "우리는 생산 라인을 조정해야 합니다. 낭비와 기어 결함 무의미한 실험들을 줄이고, 생산 능력을 향상시켜 어떻게 병사들을 개선할 수 있는지 알아봐야 합니다."
ENG_combined_arms_force:0 "제병 연합 부대"
ENG_combined_arms_force_desc:0 "노출된 보병은 총에 맞아 쓰러질 수 있고, 혼자 있는 전차는 가까이 접근할 수 있는 적에게 빼앗길 수도 있습니다. 그들이 같이 싸우게 된다면 최고가 될 수 있습니다."
ENG_quality_quantity:0 "수량보다 품질"
ENG_quality_quantity_desc:0 "고도로 훈련된 정예 병사들, 자신의 일을 알고 효율적으로 하는 병사들이 필요합니다. 열 명의 징집병들은 훈련된 한 사람을 대신할 수 없고, 백 명의 징집병은 싸울줄 아는 분대의 능력을 능가할 수 없습니다."
ENG_imporve_artillery:0 "포병에 투자"
ENG_imporve_artillery_desc:0 "대전쟁의 진정한 살인귀는 대포였습니다. 끊임없이 불을 내뿜는 포화가 종달새의 지저귐을 집어삼키고 땅 위에 흉터를 남겼습니다. 대포의 압도적인 숫자에, 압도적 기술 앞에 사람은 산 채로 묻혀버리고 말았습니다. 이제와 같이 앞으로도, 그 피해자는 우리가 될 것입니다."
ENG_reconnaissance_companies:0 "정찰 중대"
ENG_reconnaissance_companies_desc:0 "광대한 구역을 정찰할 수 있는 정찰 중대는 귀중합니다. 훈련된 인재들은 지형에 대한 예리한 지식만 있으면, 그 어떤 적을 맡더라도  최소한의 사상자만 감수하면 될 것입니다."
ENG_fund_artillery_corps:0 "포병대 지원금"
ENG_fund_artillery_corps_desc:0 "포병대 지원금을 늘려 그들이 더 크고, 좋고, 더 많은 포를 가지게 할 것입니다. 영국의 대포는 왕의 땅과 왕의 명예를 해치려는 모든 사람들이 두려워하게 될 것입니다."
ENG_cult_of_artillery:0 "포병의 문화"
ENG_cult_of_artillery_desc:0 "QF 6파운더, 전함 주포, 곡사포, 쾅하고 쏘는 것은 무엇이든 군대에서 사랑받고 환영받습니다. 우리가 적을 겨냥하고 성벽과 요새를 파괴하며, 탑을 무너뜨리는 어떤 것도, 우리의 방어선 뒤에서 보면 아주 환영할 만한 일입니다. "
ENG_commonwealth_war_games:0 "영연방 군사 훈련"
ENG_commonwealth_war_games_desc:0 "우리는 우리의 자치령과 싸우기를 원하지 않지만, 자치령의 군인들과 우리의 군인들이 공동의 적에 맞서 싸울지 모르기 때문에, 군사 훈련과 우리 병사들을 훈련시켜야 합니다. 새로운 교리는 새 군사 훈련을 의미하고 새 군사 훈련은 더 나은 교리를 의미합니다."
ENG_glorious_army:0 "영광스러운 군대"
ENG_glorious_army_desc:0 "영국군은 다시 한 번 제국의 수호자가 되었으며, 유럽의 빛이며, 자유와 문명의 수호자입니다! 국왕 만세!"

ENG_ECNB:0 "현 해군기지 확장"
ENG_ECNB_desc:0 "우리 해군의 야망은 더 이상 가로막혀서는 안됩니다. 거대한 해군은 더 좋은 기지, 더 좋은 보급, 더 좋은 조선소 및 수리 시설을 필요로 합니다. 우리는 이미 항구를 가지고 있지만, 더 많이 확장할 필요가 있습니다"
ENG_dockyard_buildup:0 "조선소 건립"
ENG_dockyard_buildup_desc:0 "배를 만드는 것은 쉬운 일이 아니며, 주력함이 강철판으로 강력한 짐승으로 변하려면, 몇 달에서 몇 년이 걸릴 수 있습니다. 여러 개의 조선소를 건설하여 개별 조선소의 부담을 줄여, 우리가 배정하는 다른 프로그램에도 전적으로 집중할 수 있게 만들어야 합니다."
ENG_protect_the_convoys:0 "수송대 보호"
ENG_protect_the_convoys_desc:0 "대전쟁에서 우리는 독일 제국의 잠수함에게 많은 배와 호위함을 빼앗겼습니다. 귀중한 호송함을 보호하기 위한 새로운 전술과 기술은 필수적입니다. 호송함들 중 어느 것도 빼앗겨버리는 것은 영국군의 누군가가 베이컨과 총알을 빼앗겨, 전쟁에서 패배한다는 것을 의미하기 때문입니다."
ENG_blockade_preparations:0 "봉쇄 대비"
ENG_blockade_preparations_desc:0 "우리는 최악의 경우 둘러싸이거나, 봉쇄당할 준비가 되있어야 합니다. 한 나라를 굶기는 것은 해군과 함께 가장 효과적인 전술이며, 적절한 계획이 없다면 큰 낭패를 볼 수가 있습니다."
ENG_sub_warfare:0 "잠수함전"
ENG_sub_warfare_desc:0 "U보트, 즉 잠수함은 대전쟁에서 큰 효과적인 성능을 보여주었습니다. 우리가 계속 진행중인 해군 경쟁에서 뒤쳐지지 않으려면, 이것들의 사용을 확대하는 것이 매우 중요할 것입니다. 해저에서 보이지도, 들키지도 않는다는 위력은 허버트 조지 웰즈가 한때 상상했던 환상인 것처럼 보였던 능력입니다. 그러나 지금 그것은 현실이 되어 나타났습니다."
ENG_a_global_force:0 "세계군대"
ENG_a_global_force_desc:0 "우리는 대영제국의 힘을 세계의 바다와 대양에 확장할 수 있어야 합니다. 뉴질랜드 해안에서 부터, 뉴펀들랜드 해안, 그리고 우리의 채널 제도까지 영국 해군은 어떠한 위협에도 대응할 수 있을 것입니다."
ENG_generation_battleships:0 "신세대 전함"
ENG_generation_battleships_desc:0 "전함, 그들은 해전에서 매우 중요한 역할을 담당하고, 수 세기 동안 해전을 경험해왔습니다. 우리는 이 사상이 바뀔 것이라고 가정할 생각은 하지 않습니다. 신세대 전함이 필요한 순간입니다"
ENG_listen_air_arm:0 "Air Arm 경청"
ENG_listen_air_arm:0 "Air Arm은... unorthodox 발상들을 갖고 있습니다. Entire vessels, stripped of offensive capabilities, and instead filled with planes.

The twenties for Britain would be the opposite of the great war, a time of peace and relative prosperity, the victory of the Labour Party in the 1926 election over the recently elected conservative government of 1922 caused a small welfare state to form and lives for the common man improved. Led by Arthur Henderson, Britain continued unchanged while the world shifted around it.\n\n This time of peace and prosperity would be stopped in 1931, where Arthur Henderson was assassinated by a French facist and riots consumed Britain. The Labour party unable to deal with the issues lost in the 1931 election to the Conservative party led by Austen Chamberlain who quickly formed a national unity government to tackle the problem. With problems on the mainland, issues in the colonies expanded and grew out of control, culminating in the Indian revolt of 1934 and fall of the British Raj. The National Unity Government would be unable to deal with these problems and in 1934 when the british stock markets crumbled due to the revolt, it took down the world economy with it.\n\n With the government entering 1936, Austen Chamberlain has called a snap election to end the parliamentary deadlock, will Britain recover and resume its place on the world stage, or will the British Lion finally be driven to extinction.

Police were at the scene to monitor the event in the case of either violent activity or communist activity, but luckily there was little in the way of either. What is of note was a speech by Labour Party MP George Lansbury, who has been outspoken in his anti-war views from the start. He condemned the government for what he called their “policy of walking headfirst into another pointless war on the mainland”, and criticized Winston Churchill in particular, saying that “one should expect no better from a man who confesses to have loved the war.” His speech was quite popular amongst the crowd, but whether it will have any effect on the public at large will have to be seen."

Their propaganda portrays us as attempting to bring British rule to the northern states of France, much like how it was before the Hundred Years War, and they’ve actively funded rebel groups in the region. Just today, pro-futurist groups clashes violently with numbers of refugees trying to flee the country. Calling them cowards, these radicals asserted that Le Patron would be ashamed of their treachery, and they began to assault one of the groups of them. This would snowball into a quite large riot, with police working all day to arrest every single instigator and rebel. No one was killed, thank God, but many were wounded, and many are calling the government’s ability to handle the refugee crisis into question.

The British copy of the weapon, known as the Bren, is quickly becoming more popular than the classic Lewis gun, and with Europe heating up, the army knows how foolish it would be to turn down someone like Holek. The Bren gun uses a 30 round box magazine and can be fired from both a prone and a standing position. It fires a .303 round, and is shorter and lighter than the Lewis gun. The generals were consistently impressed with Holek’s display, and after much talk, Holek was hired as a producer and designer of weaponry for the army.

Claude didn’t understand how the Scottish lived in these mountains for so many years. “Goddamn, the Highlands are a nightmare! How about now?!” He aggravatedly asked. “Much better, Claude. What’s your location?” The sergeant asked. The soldier looked around for any recognizable landmarks, but started to panic a little when he realized there weren’t any.\n\n“Uh, sir?

Don’t move anywhere and stay on the walkie talkie, understood?” “Yes, sir.” The soldier said. He sat on the rocks overlooking the plains, and stared up into the skies, breathing deeply in order to relax. He notices two flashing lights in the sky, and the plane that carried them.

The technological terror of machine guns, gas and mass artillery created a bloodbath the world had never witnessed before, and sadly, we walked right into it without a clue as to what to do. Now, years after the war, we are still trying to learn from it all. \n\nThree main proposals now stand. The first, from general J. F. C. Fuller, argues that the army should adopt a strategy based around speed and mobility, and he had been an adamant proponent of armored warfare and mechanized infantry. His ties to Pro-French futurist groups, however, has made many weary. The second comes from B. H. Liddel Hart, who has said that the Great War has taught us that the future of warfare will be mostly defensive, and that the army should focus on refining tactics for defending the empire and working on how to actually plan well when attack come. This argument, while popular amongst some, has been criticized for its total rejection of maneuver or the ability for technology to change the way a battle is fought. Finally, Alan Brooke has argued that the army should focus on overwhelming firepower in order to completely shatter and destroy the enemy forces. His theories are popular amongst artillerymen, but the proposers of Fuller’s plan believe that victory can be achieved without total destruction.\n\nWhatever one picks, it is important to remember that the lives of every single soldier in the army, and the lives of those on the home front, lays in the hands of the generals. The Somme was not just a strategic failure, but a moral one, and those who choose doctrine better have a damn good reason as to why they picked what they did."

In other words, people learn better when it is made into a game. The same goes with military affairs, and there is no better time to see this in action than the Commonwealth War Games. All of the empire’s best officers and a good portion of their men are invited to participate in simulations of actual combat, in order to refine their skills and learn how to adapt. After all, it's better to learn in the safety of the exercises than in the middle of combat.\n\nLast year, the officers participated in a theoretical stand-off with the Germans, played by volunteers with terrible impressions of the German accent. This year, they fought the French, who had even worse accents (how they get worse every year we will never know). The simulation was a theoretical defense of Calais, wherein the British had to hold off against waves of French attacks until reinforcements arrived. The French fought with a mixture of mass wave assaults with infantry and quick maneuvers with the armored corps. The British officers did quite well, but they were eventually overwhelmed and defeated. The loss didn’t matter too much; for one thing, our officers now have a much better idea as to what is expected of them in live combat. Individual failings were few and far between; most of the issues came down to general coordination and the stress of combat.\n\nWhen it comes to the French devils, one can never be too prepared.

The factories are in full swing, recruitment is ramping up, and women are filling the roles men once did. As Lord Nelson once said, “Every man must do his duty.” The problem, however, is that just because they must, doesn’t mean it will work. The Home Guard, militia units formed in case of a naval invasion of the main isles, are mostly made up of reservists and old men, and haven’t exactly gotten the equipment they need.\n\nThe Home Guard is made up of 1,682,000 volunteers. They had 847,000 rifles, 47,000 shotguns and 49,000 machine guns of various kinds. All of this sounds good, until you realize that this meant that 739,000 men had no weapons whatsoever. The Prime Minister, outraged by this, wrote to the Home Office and said that “every man must have a weapon of some sort, be it only a mace or a pike”. The Home Office clearly didn’t understand the joke, because they ordered from the Ministry of Aircraft Production over 250,000 pikes, made out long steel tubes with old bayonets jammed at the ends.\n\nMany are quick to laugh at this, but in a way, there is some hope to be found in this. The Home Guard were eager to train with them, meaning that they’re fine fighting in close quarters combat, as long as they had some kind of equipment.

eng.15.d:0 "While many involved with British politics have been content to merely use parliament to pass reforms (or to stop their passing), some have believed that they must use “other” methods to attain power. Archibald Maule Ramsay, a Scottish MP turned far-right anti-semite, has been a leading figure in Britain’s accelerationist movement. Along with the tomboyish monarchist Rotha Lintorn-Orman and the radical propagandist William Joyce, they had made up what liberal and socialist newspapers called the “Devil’s Triumvirate”; the product of French accelerationism combined with British patriotism and a hatred of Jews and other people deemed foreign to the fatherland they would kill for. So when this group proposed a march through the historically Jewish neighborhood of Cable Street, people were naturally suspicious. Letting them around Jews would be like letting the Japanese generals take a stroll through Chinatown; it's not a matter of “if” a fight breaks out, but a matter of “when”. So the people of Cable Street protested; they didn’t want this kind of violence to come to their homes, and they’d happily fight them if they tried anything. This leaves the Triumvirate in a bit of an odd position. They don’t want to incur the wrath of the government and the people; Ramsay’s experience as an MP has told him that anti-democratic movements still need the people to support. But they also don’t want to look weak; how embarrassing would it be for the movement calling Jews inferior to be repelled by their complaining? Finally, after much discussion. The Triumvirate came to a decision."

The British accelerationist movement’s leadership felt as though they weren’t ready for a movement of this nature, and that as sad as this would be, it would be worth it in the long wrong. So Ramsay wrote an open letter to the people of Cable Street, criticizing their intolerance to his ideas and warned them that “this kind of authoritarianism would make Britain look like Germany in just a few short years”. And the people of Cable Street chuckled a bit, shrugged their shoulders and went back to their work. But the Devil’s Triumvirate was far from done. Rather than march there, they instead turned their attention to Liverpool, where the reception was far less hostile. The march would be led by Rotha Lintorn-Orman, would would give a speech on the counterproductive nature of parliament and affirm the power of the king. Everything went well for them; resistance was minor, and the bobbies and blackshirts kept any hostile protestors at bay. Rotha’s speech was good, but some are concerned for her. She slurred a bit in her speaking; to be polite, her frequent drug usage is no secret amongst the leadership or the rank and file of the movement."

The Metropolitan has sent a detachment of the police to keep the peace, and the blackshirts have been preparing melee weapons for the fight. This would be a bloodbath. As soon as the marchers walked upon the street, they started to clash with the counter protestors, who had built a barricade in order to stop the march. All sorts of weapons were used; sticks, rocks, chair legs, rotten food, cricket bats. If it existed, it was weaponized. The police charged the barricade in order to break up the fight, and brutally smacked down the residents with force.

After all of that, they ended the march with speeches from the three leaders“In the face of it all, Britain has survived, and she shall continue to.” Said Orman. “But I want this nation and her empire to flourish, not merely to carve out a meager existence. And as long as the talking shop in Westminister exists, then it shall never flourish. Authority comes not from politicians, but from the throne!” Her speeches resonated with an ultra loyalist sect within the movement. Ramsay played up the anti-semtic rhetoric, damning the Jews “for securing our loss in the war”, and promised a Britain free of “Judeo-Councilist influence”. Finally, Joyce called for a more aggressive foreign policy. “Britain is an empire, and an empire it shall remain. For war and conquest is the very thing that makes our Anglo-Saxon empire glorious and desirable. This has been a great day for the far-right, and a nightmare for everyone else.

They would fight! And fight they did. He and a few loyal paramilitaries charged upon isolated protestors, clubbing and beating them while they were down. The more organized anti-accelerationists grouped up and fought back, but this really scared the public. This scuffle snowballed into a riot, and it travelled throughout London. By this time, Ramsay and Orman were far away, thankful that they weren’t connected in any way. The police worked overtime to bring calm to the city, cracking down hard on curfews and public gathering until finally, the dust settled. Needless to say, the people of Britain are not enthusiastic about Ramsay and his crew. In their mind, they really are the “Devil’s Triumvirate”. "

His statements and plans have made many worried that the National Unity government might fracture, and people within the party are talking about a possible replacement of him with Nancy Mitford, a moderate MP and a charismatic politician in her own right. Morrison is now facing calls to resign and allow Mitford to take his place. He could do it, and presumably allow the Unity Government to go on as it did before.

eng.29.d:0 " In the eternal battle of ideas that forever envelops democracies, the written world is a powerful tool. Being able to effectively and convincingly promote one’s ideas is necessary before one can even think of problems of tactics and mobilization. The right has done quite well in this regard; tabloids of all kinds have been used to promote a Tory and even far-right perspective on British politics. And now, the left has a tool of their own. The Left Book Club is a publishing house aiming at the spreading of left-wing books amongst the people. Its founders, composed of Stafford Cripps, Victor Gollancz and John Strachey, wanted to help revitalize the socialist movement in Britain, and its mission statement is to “help in the struggle for world peace and against accelerationism”. Criticizing what they have argued is an intellectualist and anti-worker trend amongst the left, they aim to distribute popular, readable and well-argued literature amongst the working people of Britain. They aim to help peacefully dismantle the empire, focus more on diplomacy and invest in social programs to help the poor. Their line is very much the Labour Party’s program, but it will have to be seen whether it stays this way, or it takes a more aggressive path. "

eng.30.d:0 "When the Left Book Club first formed, it was an outlet for reformist socialism and social democracy in Britain. Its writers advocated for social reform, better healthcare, the peaceful end of the empire and less military spending. But now, after years of radicalization, its nearly unrecognizable. In what appears like a hostile takeover by councilists, the Book Club’s literature now includes, amongst many other things, arguments for abolishing the monarchy, replacing the army with a people’s militia, workers control of the means of production, total secularization of the government and supporting anti-colonial revolutionaries throughout our empire and others. This is an uncomfortable change of pace for many, but what's most worrying is that sales haven’t exactly gone down. Far from it; they’re doing better than ever. A pro-German distributer like this one doing that well is not a good sign, to put it politely. Our hope is that it says something so stupid and inflammatory that we have the right to shut it down, but as of right now, we have to put up and shut up."

The song and dance is quite different, of course, since one birthed liberalism and the other futurism, but the similarities are still there. Because one sees a regime that is fundamentally insane. At its core, it rejects reason, and instead embraces the most violent, unnatural and cruel parts of human character. Instead of taking an orderly, well-structured system of continental governance, such as our Commonwealth of Nations or even a European Council of sorts, they happily and gladily charge forth to recreate the horrors of the trenches, all in the name of an ideology that is, as I’ve said before, fundamentally insane.” “Edmund Burke, one of the greatest Britons, made this point all those years ago. But unlike Burke, I do not believe that this is something all Frenchmen want. Anyone who does believe that should take a stroll through Calais, and see the stream of good people of all kinds fleeing the terror of “La Patron”. This is the result of a few madman stringing an entire nation along, and that gives me confidence. Because the Empire has faced much worse, and I am confident that we shall achieve victory.” “Countrymen, listen to me! As Admiral Nelson once said, every man shall do his duty! Let us free France of this tyranny, and bring forth a new, more stable order to the continent! Let us drive out these fanatics and lunatics! Britain shall never be slaves to these barbarians!” "

Oh sure, they may call it democratic or libertarian, but we know the truth. We’re British, after all; by nature we know better!. “What this war is about is not just whether Germany dominates European affairs or not. What it is about is how politics will be conducted in the years to come, whether that’s by reasonable, responsible government or the combined terrors of mob-party rule. Ladies and gentlemen, we fight for the liberty of everyone in Britain, Germany - all of Europe! Let us ride forth and purify the Prussian menace of their barbaric tendencies!

While the dominions in Australia, Canada and New Zealand have been able to prevent revolt through careful reform and the creation of an imperial patriotism, our governments in Africa, Madras and the East Indies have been lucky to survive as long as they have.\n\n To put it simply, we will need drastic reform if we want to survive in the years ahead. Our reputation as a world power is dwindling as well. Ever since we lost the Great War, our reputation as an unbeatable, world spanning empire has started to crumble. Instead, many see us as the Austrians, with a crumbling multi-ethnic empire being towed along by bigger and better powers. We will have to do much to repair our reputation.

eng.34.d:0 "Edward VIII’s life as King has been a hectic and chaotic one. Taking the throne after his father’s death from Septicemia in 1927, Edward was in many ways still young in his manners and mindset. While his many advisors encouraged him to find a wife and to ensure the stability of the country and the legitimacy of the monarchy, he had no interest in it. Instead, he spent his time with his countless mistresses, to the dismay of the more conservative minded of the royal family and parliament. Most notably amongst them was Thelma Furness, a socialite and close companion of Edward.\n\n But the childish antics and fast living would come to an end when Edward met Pamela Mitford. The young king found here more charming and attractive than his many mistresses, and after much talk and discussion, it was decided that they would be married. This was met with the conservatives collectively thank the heavens for the boy to finally have some sense, and the royal family was happy to see the mistress's gone.\n\nIt was also an interesting choice of partner; the Mitford sisters were well known for their political involvement, with Nancy being an MP for Labour, Jessica being a fellow traveller to the Communists, and Diana being a high-ranking figure in the far-right Nordic League. Pamela was the least politically involved out of all of them, which was another factor that made the royal family appreciate his choice.\n\nThe wedding will be held during June this year, and is expected to be attended by thousands of people and many important political figures."

Edward was proud that he could stick it to the old man after all this time.\n\nHe and his newly-wed, Pamela Mitford, walked down the halls of St George’s Chapel while the people cheered and the aristocrats, politicians and royals bowed for their king. After a brief ceremony, Pamela Mitford was made the wife of Edward and Queen, an honor bestowed on very few.\n\nThe Mitford family had sent numerous wedding gifts to them both in celebration, and they often carried political connotations in regards to what they wanted King Edward to be. Jessica Mitford, a communist, sent a Brazillian copy of The Communist Manifesto, which had an ornately decorated front cover. Diana Mitford sent a copy of her good friend J. F. C. Fuller’s book The Foundations of the Science of War, which placed an emphasis on speed and mobility. Diana even left a note in it saying that “a leader needs to know how to fight, as all politics is violence harnessed by the state”. Nancy sent some wine and a Labour Party songbook, and Unity had a record of Richard Wagner’s greatest works sent. The sisters were not merely interested in just congratulating their sister; they saw the fate of Britain in their hands.\n\nThe wedding has repaired Edward’s reputation amongst many of his skeptics (or at least kept them silent), and his duties as a husband will hopefully help him settle down for now. In the meantime, it's back to politics."

One hears a story about how nothing really has changed.\n\nThere are some who claim that Edward has not left his mistresses. People claim to have seen Thelma Furness still with him, arms locked and walking to quiet hotels and shady back alleys.\n\nThis is obviously weird to those who pay attention; didn’t he abandon her for Mitford? What was the point of the marriage?\n\nIt only gets stranger from there; people have confronted Pamela about this, and all her responses seem to indicate a lack of care. She insists that the two are “just friends” and that people should respect their privacy, but other than that she comes off as indifferent to the whole thing.  This could all be just rumours, of course. The tabloids are hardly reliable, and the newspapers are often not much better. Still, to call this worrying would be an understatement."

This made people only more unsure; what on earth is going on here? Now, however, some people are really in the loop.\n\nPamela has a friend named 주디타 톰마지. An Italian horsewoman and quite athletic, she has been found to be in the company that Pamela keeps around. But, well, it’s more than that. Pamela and her are suspected to be deeply in love; reporters have seen them entering the same hotels Edward has checked into with his mistress, which is a pretty sure sign.\n\nAttempts to speak on this have ended quite badly, however; when one reporter accused Pamela of being a homosexual, Edward fired back and called him a “good for nothing presshound spouting claims with no substance”.  Needless to say, this rumour has been kept under wraps; homosexuality is a crime under the law, and the reputation hit the royal family could take would be nasty.\n\nBut Edward and Pamela are quite happy; they both needed each other as friends and as solutions to problems, and once that was done, they have pursued new partners. Maybe all is quiet within the family."

On top of that this has spurred rebel activity to a serious and worrying degree. Granted, Lord John Ersinke and Orde Wingate have done well in suppressing rebellions across the country. Wingate’s “chindits” are well-trained for fighting in rough climate and have beaten back the rebels wherever they may be, and Ersinke has worked hard to see the army reform itself into something resembling a regular army. But that won’t be enough; Travancore is giving large amounts of funding to these groups, and dissent is mounting by the hour. Now is the time we act, or else we suffer the consequences. "
