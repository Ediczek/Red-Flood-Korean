Subsequently, various groups in the Russian Republic vye for power, including military cliques that believe in multiple transformations of Russian society into new things. The Right-Kadets would be the obvious winners of any election as many people were completely disillusioned by Kerensky's SRs and demand capitalist freedom. Finally, an increasingly larger group of people led by the utopian socialist Aleksei Gastev believe in creating a new society based on radical utopian and socialist principles with an authoritarian streak, seeking to give Gastev as many powers, if not more, than Kerensky had, in the name of 'National Salvation'. \n\n As stated before, the fate of the Russian Republic lies in the balance..."

Almost all of the Army is extremely political, but in very different ways - some are anarchists, like Chapayev and his cadre, who believe the Republic should be dissolved and turned into an Anarchist commonwealth based on principles of peasant freedom and force against aristocracy. Other elements side with the Military Commissar of Vladivostok, a newly re-established position, led by Boldyrev, who believes that Kolchak is far too powerful to be fought against, and that the Russian Republic should be dissolved and turned into a part of the Russian Empire in exchange for extensive autonomy grants, something Kolchak and his allies already grant to most of Russia anyways. The rest of the Army sides with Trotsky, an agressive internationalist who believes in retaking the Motherland at all costs and ensuring that the ideals of Lenin are never perverted by people like Aleksei Gastev.

Many not close to him expected him to make a rousing speech to make the Soviet side with him, making the Russian Republic evermore stable and have a bright future filled with assurance. But no.\n\n\n that is not what happened. \n\n Gastev didn't rise to the podium of the Supreme Soviet. \n\n(This was extremely unexpected.)\n\n Instead, he simply sat at his wooden table with a felt carpet, and quietly wrote projects, saying a single sentence: \"Comrades, it is with joy that I state that the Russian Republic will be well.\" Immediately after this, the Soviet bickered in front of him. This in general was a shocking development, as it was tradition to have a leader in the Russian Republic to constantly be as power-hungry as possible, to be as rousing as possible, to try and appear as powerful as possible. But it seemed Gastev was content with appearing gentle-hearted, quiet, and a man of few words. The Soviet eventually settled down, and he looked at them blankly, returning to his projects with a gentle head and a gentler hand. Eventually, he returned a piece of paper stating that the Supreme Soviet is to be dissolved in the name of long-term stability and be replaced by appointed ministers and cabinet members by Gastev himself. \n\n In essence, Gastev had just fired over a hundred people."

After hundreds of thousands of Russians, Han, and Manchurians felt incredibly disillusioned by Kerensky's social-democratic policies and supported his resigning with a heavy heart, knowing that despite his shortcomings now, he was an important part of Russian history and a good President, at least a few years back, but still one that often undermined the democratic system. No worries now, however, as the Right-Kadets have been elected and Alisa Rosenbaum has come to power in the Republic, quickly getting to work in making a rousing and powerful speech about human freedom and the ideal society where a man owns himself, and no one shall agress on the other's property, and how this famine was caused by excess government intervention, along with the fact that it was made worse by constant meddling by welfare programs which taxed the poor and the rich and didn't benefit them at all. Alisa Rosenbaum then got to work rapidly making new laws abolishing taxes, removing laws, removing regulations, wiping out borders, and with an energy never seen before in our Democracy, doing her best efforts to make man finally be for himself."

After everything came down, she came out and delivered a speech on it.\n“This building, this shining beacon within our city, is a testament to the new Russia which we are creating today. But not because it stands there. See, this is a very nice building, but it has a fatal flaw. It was built by the state; not by an innovator or a great mind, but by government contracts and government employees. And so…” One of her bodyguards took out a TNT plunger and handed it to her, which she quickly pressed. In seconds, the building was set ablaze by explosions from all over the building. The crowd gasped and some even cried as the building fell to the earth, leaving a cloud of smoke and plaster hovering in the air.\n“If you expect the state to handout great works of art, you are a parasite.

Otherwise, you are on your own, because this world only tolerates the mighty few, and not the pathetic many.” She quickly exited the room, as the press corps was left in shock."

So, how the hell do you run it like that? Turns out, it was quite simple; run the army like a business!\nThink of it like this; every officer is like a boss in the workplace, who answer to higher ups and have to manage the workers. Sure, they’re lazy parasites, but we do need someone to do the dirty work. The same goes with the army; the chain of command must think of themselves not as selfless devotees to a cause, because that reeks of socialism. Rather, they will think of themselves as innovators and capitalists, proud in their abilities and strengths and showing only contempt for those who oppose them. Similarly, privates and lower ranked soldiers shall have to prove their worth, and if they don’t, they’re out. Goodbye!\nThis army shall be a perfect demonstration of our principles in practice.

Russia is composed of many kinds of people, and both the Tsar, the Bolsheviks and the Kolchak government only drove a wedge in between them. But we are all Russians, stretching from Petrograd to Vladivostok, and they can be unified by a common national identity and a leader whom they respect and adore. The people have willed me into office, and thus I am their sword and shield!

They seek to destroy what we have built here in favour of a regimented dictatorship. They hate our republic, and wish to subjugate you to the worst kinds of slavery and terror. I shall not allow it; every Bolshevik terrorist and his ilk will be put to the sword or the spade! They shall either work for you or die for you! Your liberty is dependent upon their subjugation or their destruction. Make no mistake citizens, for while this may seem cruel, it is mercy. For they would do far, far worse if they had even a single finger upon a pistol. We know how this song and dance ends; you have all read about what has happened in Germany after their revolution, or the fate of the generals in Hungary, or the current sufferings of the Brazillian people. This shall not happen here.”\n“Me and the Directorate shall represent and defend you at every cost. The Russian fatherland must be governed not with mere talk, but with a firm hand and a steadfast march. Kolchak, Trotsky, Drozdovsky; all shall be thrown out of this country.

Truly, he was a martyr, suffering on the behalf of the Russian people; at least, that’s what he thought.\nBut as he drifted off into slumber, he saw the most wonderful thing. He saw a map of the current world, but it started to move and change. Kingdoms and empires became republics, the accelerationist governments fell into disarray, and the Bolshevik menace in Berlin toppled. It was a world of fraternal republics, and it was beautiful. Kerensky realized his purpose in that moment; it wasn’t just to save Russia, but to bring about the End of History. His republic was the final form that all other powers would emulate; the radical changes and uprisings of years past would be replaced with slow and steady reform and change. These republics, lead by a Directorate and a powerful leader, could save the world.\nKerensky had a greater purpose than ever before. His armies and strength would plunge into darkness and come out victorious, cutting of the heads of Bolshevism and monarchism. Fraternal republics would stand free and sovereign once more!
