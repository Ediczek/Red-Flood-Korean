mog.2.desc:0 "No matter how is big the main hall of the city's theater, now it still seems microscopic and cramped, it is still a loud crowd - the deafening noise of the excited human sea mixed with the microphone voices of speakers and the stamping of many steps. Everyone is huddled, everyone is in a hurry, everyone is running somewhere - from secretaries loaded with folders and concerned officials, to journalists armed with notebooks and cameras. Not only reporters from almost all major Nikkei newspapers have appeared - next to them, but rows of seats are also occupied by representatives from the City Hall, people from Zaibatsu, cultural figures, and Shinto priests, and inconspicuous suits and white shirts of the middle-class alternate with expensive three-piece suits and even ceremonial kimonos. Huge banners covered with hieroglyphs slowly oscillate in the heated air... \n\"DAWN OF DEMOCRACY IN NIKKEI\" \n\"WE WILL BUILD A NEW WORLD WORTH OUR EFFORTS!\" There are so many of them that it is more like a carnival than a dry political event, but the same carnival, slightly relaxed atmosphere prevails in the souls. Nishimoto Rei is slightly dizzy. Yesterday he was a simple car mechanic who worked in a small workshop. Unknown and quite poor - luck has never smiled on Rei since moving from Japan. Of course, he enjoyed some respect in his neighborhood, but never, never in his life would he have thought that he could be nominated as a deputy in the first election in Nikkei! It was all so surreal as if he had mistakenly fallen into someone else's shoes, as if he had been confused with someone because deputies are not elected, they are appointed - at least until chaos engulfed the Brazilian Republic. Although his outfit has changed to a well-ironed, albeit cheap, jacket and tie, Rei still continues to talk like a car mechanic, and behave like a car mechanic, even when inspired to talk about his plans - from the normal road to a new school! And that's all said, and the hall applauds with restraint - there is still a lot of work ahead. \nRei silently surveys the audience, stuttering slightly with excitement, and suddenly\: \n-Thank you. Thank you, compatriots. Only recently you and I struggle together, and today you gave me the right to fight for you. Thank you all! You are the best! \nTears glistened in his eyes. The audience applauds, this time more persistently, pleasantly surprised by such unexpected sincerity. Cries of praise are heard from somewhere. Sweaty but happy, Nashimoto sits down in his place, someone claps him on the shoulder.\n-Well done boy, you have a great future!\nRei feels a glimmer of hope - perhaps in this future, he will be able to be useful not only repairing cars."

mog.3.desc:0 "-So, from today, we announce the creation of the first professional association of machine-building workers in Nikkei! - dry speech of the speaker in a rather elegant suit was greeted by a cloud of applause. \nDozens of hands, roughened and weathered by work clapping, and dozens of throats, eaten by metal dust, shout cheerful and life-loving slogans. Someone even climbed on the telephone pole to get a better view and shouted from his makeshift nest. \n\"Let Hiroshi speak!\" - the commotion from the crowd forces the \"costumes\" to disperse, releasing a man to the platform, who, in principle, was not much different from his flock, except limping, and carried in his flesh shrapnel left from the war. Onori Hiroshi began without preamble\: \n-On this day, we celebrate not only the creation of our union, we celebrate with you finding a new family! We are all a family, from the youngest to the oldest, from a recent immigrant to a native - even you, Sato, are our family, even though you drink like hell! Laughter is heard in the crowd, and Sato himself laughs the most. \n-We are not just defending our rights, we are fighting for our Motherland - we are creating it anew, with our own hands in this hot land! And let the war and tyranny of a handful of \"party\" robbers over working people, as happened in Japan, never happen again. \n-Liar! - an unexpected shout from the crowd caught everyone by surprise, and people were stunned, looking for someone who dared to make such accusations \n-You are a liar! - repeated once again a young man in military uniform without badges. - This man is lying - he is the same dirty communist as those who seized the Motherland! \n-Am I a communist? - Onori blushed, a vein swelled dangerously in his neck. - Am I a communist? \nThe crowd parted as Hiroshi approached the young man. He did not flinch in front of the powerful figure of the worker. \n-Do you see these scars? They were left to me by the war. Where were you while we were fighting the Reds? \n-And you won a lot? With such success, you could stay at home... \nA powerful blow made him sway and retreat to the rock back, pinching his broken nose. At that moment, Hiroshi felt the sting of something sharp and noticed a sword attached to his throat - one of the workers shook his head. \n-Don't touch him, Hiroshi. He is young and stupid. But we have a conversation with you, we, serious people. \n-Hello, Ishujiri, I have nothing to talk about with you. \nOthers joined the swordsman, and soon a circle of gloomy young men formed around them. \n-Shindo Renmei is unhappy with you. \n-Why do I must care about Shindo Renmei? We have a law, it rules, not a handful of fanatics- \n-Don't talk like that, you know perfectly well who you depend on. We may think that you are really a communist. Dissolve it - he pointed to the crowd - and we will disperse peacefully. \n-No. \n-Then it's a war."

mog.4.desc:0 "The conflict between the unions and Shindo Renmei turned into a wave of quiet violence - clashes between activists from both organizations, attacks, robberies, intimidation campaigns, and frantic littering of each other in the press. Onori Hiroshi was one of the first victims of the conflict. He was attacked last night when a union leader was returning from a party, releasing his volunteer bodyguards. Apparently, he relied on his luck or the sense of honor of his opponents. Unfortunately, there was a lack of both of them that night. Hiroshi was ambushed in a dark alley, beaten frantically using sticks and steel pipes, and dumped into a canal. He..."

mog.5.desc:0 "The trial of the murderers became a significant event, which received massive coverage in the press, not only in the local - journalists from English and American publications also drew attention to the case. Therefore, the issue of punishment for murderers has become not just a matter of justice or legality - it has become a matter of struggle between what was considered in Nikkei a \"democratic ideal\" and the authority of Tradition, bound by the bitterness of losing the homeland. And if under other conditions, Sendo-Renmin would have found many supporters, now their moral rightness was not so obvious. The struggle against the trade unionists and the communists is one thing, and the murder of a veteran and a patriot who did not do anything illegal has thrown away from them even the most reactionary circles in politics. Some even say that it is necessary to ban the organization as such - Shindo Renmei has long turned from a defender of the nation into a gang of mobsters."

Despite the fact that public opinion has largely split in half, and the parties accuse each other of treason, it has become clear to the government that this must end. Nikkei will not be able to move on, as long as the country's internal life is torn by conflicts between the new and the old, between liberalization and conservatism. We need reconciliation, and Shintoism will become the main means of reconciliation - religion is equally respected among both liberals and reactionaries. The criminals will be punished, but the government will begin a long and painful process of reconciliation."

What they will never see again - wounds are too deep to heal with coffee, blues, and cigarettes. The four of them, the youngest 16 years old (he has not yet had time to bathe in the hot Brazilian sun), the oldest 18. The four silently wait for their sentence, standing slenderly in the gloomy room of the half-ruined dojo and staring into the darkness that hides a chubby, rough-hewn figure. The master hates them, his gaze burns even through the darkness. Ishujiri carefully examines everyone, looking for their weaknesses and hidden flaws. \"So-so material.\" - The master frowns and now resembles an angry statue of the guardian spirit of the Shinto shrine. His gaze finally clings to the youngest, Yoshimoto. \n-Who was your father? \nYoshimoto bites his lip, looking gloomily at the clay floor. \n-Joiner. \n-How did he die? - a cruel question, but the child must get used to the cruelty of the world. \n-I ... I don't know. \n-I know. - A blank expression of the face of the kid, what is more in it, anger or apathy? Ishujiri would like it to be anger. \n-Your father died with this in his arms. - a brand new gray steel katana shines in the dark. -This sword is yours, take ... \nThe boy stretched out his hand hesitantly and jumped back with a howl of pain when the master hit him with a blade - not to the blood. \n-What, you can't? Coward... \nThe boy gritted his teeth and made another attempt - just to be on the ground, with cold steel on his neck. The master pressed him to the ground and returned to the frightened students. \n-You are all like Yoshimoto, do not rush to rejoice. - The master paused. - Whoever your parents were, they died with this in their arms. - Ishujiri raised his sword to the light, - but you don't deserve it yet, oh no! Until you learn to love him as your father until you learn to take care of him as your mother until you learn to caress him like a mistress - until you are dirty worms under my feet. \n-But the moment will come, - his eyes light up with righteous fire, and the disciples see in them all the trials that await them ahead - The moment will come and you will be cleansed of all worldly and unworthy, dishonest and animal, and you will become equal, you will become warriors of..."

But not everyone agrees with this, and that is why today Nikkei heard the news of an attack on a convoy of cars transporting a batch of coffee beans to the place of processing. The attackers, believed to belong to a terrorist group of so-called \"underground unions\", burned grain and scattered leaflets at the crime scene, claiming that they \"do not share communist values, but oppose the shameless deprivation of the working man of all rights and freedoms\".

The results of this bloody and heroic raid were impressive - a lot of people with dirty hearts were killed, and the entire leadership of the gang was taken as prisoners. Unfortunately, as Lieutenant Onori Hiroshi reported, most of the prisoners died of natural causes on the way to the police station. It's a pity, but there will be others."
