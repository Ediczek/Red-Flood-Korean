#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_PADMORE_DESC:0 "§Y1903년 6월 28일, 트리니다드 아루카 출생 § \n\n Born Malcom Ivan Meredith Nurse, Padmore was surrounded by opression from an early life. His Great-grandparent was sold into slavery to work to his death in Barbados from Africa, being part of the Asante tribe as a warrior that fought the British in several colonial wars. After many decades of his family line being in slavery, eventually they were freed by the British authorities, who had recently outlawed slavery. His father had been a local schoolmaster and married Anna Susanna Symister of Antigua, a scholar in naturalism. Padmore, as he was known in his writings in favor of communism that permeated the African-American political scene for years, went to the USA in 1924 to take up medical studies and campaign for Leninism and the Bolshevik tradition that was being destroyed by the pro-Kolchak forces. After the London Stock Market Crash, he realized that his future was in Liberia, where he could rouse the masses and throw out Garvey's supporters which rallied for an ultra-nationalist dictatorship in Liberia. Eventually, he made an alliance with the Poro chiefs of the countryside of Liberia after a 1935 expedition to the Hinterlands, and was plotting to take over Monrovia for over a year. Now that he is in power, he is fully able to exercise his utopian ideals of a purely African society, cleansed of American elements, and with extensive socialist backing in a Poro-Communist alliance."
POLITICS_GARVEY_DESC:0 "§YBorn 17th August 1887, Saint Ann's Bay, Jamaica § \n\n There is little that can be said about Marcus Garvey that isn't said by his enormously vibrant actions, rallies, and speeches - his violent clamors and rallies full of vitality, and his militarism that rallies over a hundred thousand African-Americans to this day. Garvey was born to a prosperous family in Jamaica, and worked as a teenager. In Kingston, he got involved with trade unionism and became interested in the ideas permeating the society which surrounded him, and eventually developed a Pan-Africanist society in Jamaica named the UNIA. Two years later, he moved to the United States and began rallying the local African-American population of the South with a fierce vitality which was unprecedented by many Americans, eventually making deals with the Ku Klux Klan in securing trade routes to bring African-Americans back to their homeland - Africa. Despite small cells of support at the start, Garvey preservered, and with over two decades of build-up, he's managed to rally hundreds of thousands of African-Americans to leave America for a future in Liberia, a society that he sees as the clay to create an utopian nation which is militaristic, totalitarian in it's militancy, and powerful enough to combat Western imperialists, while still maintaining many American values over to the new nation. Now that Garvey managed to coup the Government, he's reached the absolute peak of his power - ruling a nation."
POLITICS_FIRESTONE_DESC:0 "§YBorn 20th April 1898, Columbiana, Ohio, USA § \n\n Little doubt remains that Harvey Firestone Jr. Was a privileged child. He studied in a private university, and he is the child of Harvey Samuel Firestone, one of the most powerful people in all of the rubber industry of the United States. Therefore, he's always been an ambitious child, seeking at all costs to be just like his father in success - and surely enough, he has succeeded with one of the most daring plots of the 20th century; take over an entire nation and turn it into a giant rubber-producing corporation. Now that he has total control over Liberia after the chaos with the dissolution of the True Whig Party, Harvey Firestone Jr. Has an immense road up towards him, which will either bring Liberia to a new age or make it fall to another profoundly corrupt oligarchy."

lib.1.desc:0 "라이베리아가 끓어오르고 있습니다.\n\n Citing government corruption, poor management of industry and lack of response to problem of ethnic tensions splitting the country, citizens of Liberia took radical actions. Groups of mostly young men, immigrants from US started to organise loose associations quite a while ago but recently those merged into singular grassroots movement lead by ever controversial Marcus Garvey. Their dissatisfaction with their new homeland beared a fruit in a form of organised march towards the capital. While organisers denny any violent intentions, armed crowds are likened more to marching army than peacefull demonstration. Goverment response can be only one: meet protestors in open field.\n\n Two groups meet outside the city limits..."

It's unclear how Garvey was able to secure so much sympathy in the military but facts are undeniable: uninterupted he marched into the capital in triumph like a Black Ceasar. Given emergency powers, in a radio speech he assured citizens of Liberia that their future is secure and there are no reasons to worry. Liberia is on a path towards greater tomorrow! \n\n People at large took government takeover surprisingly well. Tension was growing for quite a while, everyone was expecting something to happen. Something indeed happening seemingly put an end to that. Now, everyone could just go back to their daily lifes... Except not. Ease with which garveists convinced military to join them should be suspicious but in their triumph they were blinded to this fact. Army was indeed infiltrated by their supporters, sure. But not just by them. For years society way more ancient and secretive than pan-africanists had spread its webs over Liberia. And current troubles were perfect time for the spider to strike. \n Poro societies came to revolt. Within army, within goverment, within homes of everyday citizens raised vicious horde ready to take away back their premordial birthright..."

They had managed to seize much of the area between the Hinterlands and the Grain Coast, and quickly got to work seizing the capital of Monrovia through reinforcements from the port of Harper. Eventually, after extreme violence in the capital, it appears that they have come out on top, decapitating one of the Poro chiefs and cutting the hands off of the children of the Poro-associated families, brutally seizing the Government capital as George Padmore was brutally hacked to death. It appears that Liberia, after days of anarchy, has finally fallen to total corporate control."

He is the one that is assimilated into American culture, speaks American, talks American, thinks American, and believes in American ideals. He must be done away with immediately and violently in a people's war in the Interior, where we shall do away with all elements of the former Americo-Liberian aristocracy which had forever shackled the native peoples of Liberia in opression and slavery.

Some critics called it too grand to be possible to finish, a monumental waste of money, racial self-idolatry on a cosmic scale... But against all odds movie was finally finished.  Monumental, almost three hours long masterpiece was at last screened to wider audience in Monrovia.

Way bigger crowd gathered outside of the cinema in hopes of catching a glimpse of the so long awaited curiosity. \n Initial reviews are mixed: some praised richness of themes and almost dream-like atmosphere, others criticised hard to follow plot.

Many elements have now come to a head in Monrovia fighting over who is the superior group, and eventually, after extensive fighting with eachother which almost resulted in a violent civil war, Garvey's militias have entered Monrovia and stopped the fighting, demanding the groups have a ceasefire to continue the peace in Liberia.

However, an even more extreme wing within the wing is the Sun Ra Arkestra, a band of improvisational musicians who believe in creating 'Cosmic Music', a highly experimental form of Jazz. They believe that the ancient Egyptians, and their leader, Hermann Poole Blount, have had contact with extraterrestrial beings from Jupiter (and many other planets) and believe that they sent a message to Blount asking him to create music that would bring his spirit to the stars.

They claim that King Solomon and the Queen Of Sheba are both Israelites and that Ethiopia in general is a holy Israelite territory. They have become increasingly popular as groups uninterested in Islam or Kemetic beliefs have went to them looking for a new perspective on Black Identity, and many synagogues have been formed around Liberia - even if without government funding, they aren't the most sophisticated, but they clearly show profound dedication to their ideals and truly believe that they are the Chosen People."
