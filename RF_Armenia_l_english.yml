#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_GAREGIN_DESC:0 "Garegin Nzhdeh is a controversial figure in Armenia, being seen as an extreme ultra-nationalist and violent chauvinist by many of the socialist political estabilishment, and as a national hero by his Tseghakronists, who believe in a strict social hierarchy based on devotion to the Armenian nation. While this is a state secret, his birth name is Garegin Ter-Harutyunyan. Nzdeh was born to a poor family in the village of Kznut, in Nakchivan, born to a family of four of a local priest. Nzhdeh received his education through a Russian school in Nakhchievan City, and then continued his higher education in Georgia. During the Russian Revolution, he fled from Bulgaria and went back to his Armenian homeland, he led militias to liberate Western Armenia from Turkish rule according to the Wilsonian Treaty of Sevrés. Now he sits at the top of the Armenian political world after decades of intrigue, rallies, and denouncings of the socialist Government of Armenia. What future he shall bring to Armenia is up in the air."
