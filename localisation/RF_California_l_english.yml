CAL.1.title:0 "Oh How Far The Mighty Have Fallen"
CAL.1.desc:0 "Welcome to California - regardless of how you've arrived here, America Has collapsed. Nothing else except our fair nation quite matters anymore - from the Sea we came, and to the Shining Sea we arrived. We, the heirs of Jamestown, have finally arrived to the logical conclusion of the American Experiment; Death. \n\n And so, we must pick up the pieces and try to continue living, even if it requires scraping by in poverty. People in the streets are dying, the Riverside Council is trying it's best to maintain order as resources get badly allocated, and chaos in general ensues, but there is also a patriotic profundity in this new Experiment being birthed from the American Experiment. Perhaps good things will come from this."
CAL.1.a:0 "어쩌면 이게 우리의 미래일지도."
CAL.2.title:0 "You're in for a Scare!"
CAL.2.desc:0 "From his apartment Bodin watched the sunset engulf the innocent of California, as the monsters realm beckoned out. As the signs of Light vanquished slowly he could already feel the evil presence of demonry and ungodliness arrive within the air. All around the world was the spirit of evil fermenting, zombie, ghosts, extra-terrestrials, and of course the flaws of mortal men, all to come out after the sun. For hours he watched out his window as the world went into black. He tried to get himself to shut out the world after that, to blissfully go into the realm of fantasy, but the problem kept gnawing at him, and he was forced to reside within the domain of the paranormal until God sent the sun back. But he figured that it was all but pointless to fight this struggle alone, so he turned on KCW, one of his favorite broadcasting stations to help give some comfort within this blackness. But the contents proved that the darkness had infested much more then his limited physical vision. Horror stories came on the air as the situation in the East was revealed to be radiply deteriorating, and that civil war was immenent. 'Of course' he muttered silently to himself, 'the darkness comes earlier in the East'. The announcment filled him with dread, but also something else, something he hadn't expected; hope. He knew that eventually the darkness would end but... if it could be expediented wouldn't that just be better for the world? 'Enlightenment' is what they called it, the torch... YES! He realized, and immediatley rang up the quite frightened operator and with the excitment of a goal of an eternity finally coming into reach he asked;"
CAL.2.a:0 "\"Operator? Put me in to Alan Frost!\""
CAL.3.title:0 "Olson's Pipe Dream"
CAL.3.desc:0 "Olson could hardly bear the thought. The east was done, he knew that. The Anarchists had done their part, the military was revolting, the situation was basically done and over with. But that is not what he had to do today, was it? No. Today he had to go to yet another conference for his election campaign. What election? The radicals were never going to play by the rules, everyone knew that. He should be trying to preserve the institutions that built this state and Union instead of pretending that everything was fine. Cursing himself for being such a politician, he drove up to that damned office. When he opened the door he was certainly not expecting a dizzying set of reporters asking his opinion on the whole matter and how it would affect California. \"You want my opinion on the current situation? Well, there is really only one thing to say. We are going to stand through this, you know why? Because we've got brains, brawn, and kindness to do so, and we're not ready to kill each other over such trivial things. We cannot allow ourselves to fall like everyone else has, because if not us, then who?\""
CAL.3.a:0 "\"아직 답을 못 들었는데.\""
CAL.4.title:0 "아 그래, 이거 좀 쩌는데"
CAL.4.desc:0 "Sinclair walked down the street, before his eyes forming a gloomy image of downtrodden Los Angeles. First the market crash, then this disaster of a presidency, made this city a shadow of the former self. The homeless and beggars became a common sight even in the once nice and clean parts of the city, many buildings were abandoned, standing like empty brick husks. All of this made Sinclair sick. The bigwigs in the establishment seemed to be derived of compassion, not even noticing how their shenanigans made this nation die. Something had to be done, the state should finally help its good people, not some liberal bureaucrats or whoever this madman Bodin served. His message was as blunt and direct as a club – End Poverty In California."
CAL.4.a:0 "A nation cannot claim greatness when her sons are starving."
CAL.5.title:0 "A Council By The River"
CAL.5.desc:0 "For a few months, the quiet paradise of Riverside would become the beating heart of the world, and Steinbeck would not let himself miss the golden opportunity to see it first-hand. Notebook ready, he strolled down the decadent Queen Anne mansions and tourist-friendly Spanish Mission style hotels. Dodging the hundreds of other journalists and dozens upon dozens of military policemen was a hard task, but nothing his athletic body could not handle. He reached a good spot to look over the whole scene. From there, just some feet away from the old courthouse, he could spot everyone easily. There was the tall and melancholic figure of C. C. Young talking to his sinister friend Giannini, the banker; and not much farther away lukewarm Democrat Creel passionately argued with someone from his own party, as usual. He could not help but notice as well some familiar faces from movies, like Clark Glabe, Spencer Tracy, and Katharine Hepburn. Although he had heard Hepburn was a convinced leftist like himself, she did not seem to take issue with the two men's spiritualist affiliation, and the three laughed quietly together. Neither Bodin nor his lackey Hubbard appeared to have come to the first meeting of the Riverside Council. That was for the better, as Steinbeck didn't believe he had the stomach to endure reporting on some schizophrenic drivel about ghost stories and pseudo-intellectual Gnosticism. Finally, his eyes met the man he had been looking for this entire time: Upton Sinclair. The last hope for a fair and just California, robbed of his opportunity to change the dying state. Sinclair was completely alone, while other Socialists chatted nearby. It was time, and every man from every party started making their way to the gargantuan marble arches of the courthouse. Stoic Sinclair suddenly sprung into motion, walking decisively towards the Council. Only time would tell its outcome."
CAL.5.a:0 "The Californian interregnum begins"
CAL.6.title:0 "KCW Broadcast - 1"
CAL.6.desc:0 "Calculated seconds of dramatic silence passed until the presenter squirmed in his seat and carefully read the note the station had sent him. This could very well be the most important moment of his career as a radio personality. He gasped for air away from the mic and turned to speak. Despite being cripplingly nervous he managed to be as monotone and clear as possible for his audience.\n“This is an official announcement from the Emergency Committee of the State of California, henceforth called the Riverside Council. Seeing the inability of the Federal Government of the United States of America to maintain a state of normalcy in the Union, California will, from now on, be politically and economically self-sufficient until said state of nation-wide normalcy is restored. California will, as well, not join or participate any plots against what is left of the United States. This is a formal declaration of neutrality, and attacks against its sovereign territory will be answered with the strength of arms. Any and all citizens who wish to know more details of the situation should contact their local representatives, as they are instructed to answer any questions asked. Order and stability shall be guaranteed under any circumstances.". God bless California, and God bless America.”\nThe stanzas of “I Love You, California” blared from the radio of every citizen, filling the homes of millions with an uncertain future."
CAL.6.a:0 "The Sunset State Rises"
CAL.7.title:0 "We Are, In Fact, A Democracy"
CAL.7.desc:0 "One thing that may be forgotten through the last postponement of state elections and the backroom power-sharing agreements of the Riverside Council is that the new California Republic is still a democratic state. As the immediate situation stabilizes, two things are becoming evident: first that there is very little the Republicans, Democrats, Progressives, and Spiritualists can agree on, and second that the general population would like to have a say in the government. We need an election!\n\nThe first federal elections in the new state will be critical to establishing what kind of country the new California will be. With the stakes so high, it promises to be a dramatic, contested event. Hopefully we can withstand it."
CAL.7.a:0 "Let's get to work!"
CAL.8.title:0 "KCW Broadcast - 2"
CAL.8.desc:0 "\"To all new listeners, I must remind them that in this special program we're closely following the latest developments of our general elections until the results are declared. There have been no relevant incidents so far, save for a single street brawl in Los Angeles between some Sinclairites and Old Democrats. It is a pleasure to see that despite all the hardships suffered, all the uncertainty, there is hope and reason in our beautiful state. The results should be in soon, just have to wait for our contacts in Riverside to phone us. Have you made any bets on who'll win, folks?\"\n\nHe paused for some time to take a sip of his whiskey-on-the-rocks and move around in his seat, finding a more comfortable position. He had already been talking for almost two hours with only a handful of songs in between to catch a breath. Yet, he was incredibly happy. He was the living voice of the most important elections in Californian history, a million families listening to every word that came from his mouth. He tasted the whiskey, delighted and pleased with himself. His producer knocked on the window that divided the room between the recording booth and the technician's console and held a piece of paper against the glass.\n\n\n\"I've just received a new update from Riverside itself, it seems! Pay close attention! It says…\""

CAL.9.title:0 "제퍼슨의 그릇된 관념"
CAL.9.desc:0 "Jefferson is a joke of a nation above us - it barely holds on to it's mountain realm, hiding in pillow forts with toy guns as their soldiers of tin whine about rural autonomies, something we'd be willing to discuss if they weren't so uppity. Now, it is time to strike - it is time to do something about these separatists weakening our beloved California, our Golden Nation, our Allegro, our beauty! We will stop them at all costs if we are to get precious rural land and mountains back, for harvesting of water, of resources, of grain! We need these resources or our people will dwindle! Regardless - it would give the Riverside Council that needed push of legitimacy."
CAL.9.a:0 "전쟁계획을 준비하도록."
CAL.11.title:0 "The Mormon Threat"
CAL.11.desc:0 "If the fear of fifth columnists and plots to destabilize the state was strong before, it was only inflamed further by the independence of Deseret to the east. When the Mormon-dominated state of Utah seceded and took Nevada with it, other peoples under the banner of the Latter-day Saint church were immediately viewed with suspicion. Would the inland reaches of California, with their own Mormon settler populations, be next? It was not even a century ago that the brief Utah War between the federal government and the Church stoked tensions in this state.\n\nWith paranoia raised, the impacts on local Mormon communities have been sharply negative, with angry private citizens being ignored by the authorities when they ride to the border to “head off enemy plots.” When their targets band together to defend themselves, the stories only grow with the telling. Even within the political establishment of California, people with associations with the LDS are under fire – Democrat Culbert Olson, having been born in Utah, has only narrowly avoided “early retirement” after braving much vandalism of his office."
CAL.11.a:0 "But what if?!"
CAL.14.title:0 "KECA Los Angeles Broadcast – 1"
CAL.14.desc:0 "As the various ballots were counted across the state of California and people proudly voted, the military schemed.\n\nUnits across Los Angeles bribed local garrison guards, and slowly went through security to the Council itself, with another part of the Los Angeles garrison entering the KECA Radio Broadcast site, resulting in various movements occurring all at once, and in the draw of a breath, things began to get spooky.\n\nThe smooth sax of Coleman Hawkins died down, and the booming voice of the radio host came back once again. He was always confident and cheery despite the hardships and doubt that plagued the state, an anchor of calm and peace in uncertain times. The voice smacked his lips and began the live broadcast from L.A. “As always, delightful. Now we come back to our news report with the latest from Riverside. As our audience may know, we have been dutifully updating you on this situation for the past months and today is no different. It seems like the session might be about to begin, this time to discuss the upcoming elections! Isn't that exciting, friends? The first speaker will be –”\n\nSuddenly, a loud bang interrupted him, and a second voice shouted to get the host's attention. What followed was an entire minute of unintelligible whisper-shouting and a tense exchange no one in the audience could make sense of. Finally, after some seconds of complete silence, the original voice spoke again. However, now he was croaky and brittle, as if about to have a mental breakdown or start crying desperately. “It is… my God. I must tragically report that...” This time, he really sounded as if he was sobbing like a child in front of an audience of thousands of listeners, confused and some terrified at what must have just happened to affect him this much. “The Spiritualist Party has seized all apparatuses of State, and with the help of the Army, will bring order to... California...”"
CAL.14.a:0 "Hollywood really wasn't a paper tiger, after all."
CAL.15.title:0 "Wild Geese"
CAL.15.desc:0 "The convoys running across Los Angeles, and particularly Hollywood, were buzzing with joy as the larger militias began to fight with the San Francisco garrison, and the celebrations did not turn out to be anticipated incorrectly, as the San Francisco garrison had surrendered after negotiations. With the loss of San Francisco, and the rural areas being tamed, it seemed as if the Spiritualist Party had gained all seats of power.\n\nProclaiming a \"Spiritual Dictatorship\", Edward Longstreet Bodin quickly took to Los Angeles to prepare a speech... Everything had gone right for him, and the military was happy - mostly. Celebrities were joyous as they drank absurdly expensive champagne in their residencies, and people across California prepared for a scare."
CAL.15.a:0 "It'll be fine."
CAL.16.title:0 "A Cosmic Anomaly"
CAL.16.desc:0 "As Edward Longstreet Bodin paced around his compound awaiting news from the attack on the Riverside Council, he considered whether what he was doing was worth it. \"For thousands of years,\" he pondered, \"the forces beyond this realm seem to have landed their aid to the powers that be, with the might of law and order overcoming any kind of spiritual rebellion in the world. Will this be any different?\"\n\nBodin looked over to the radio, which remained deafeningly silent.\n\n\"I suppose we shall see, for we haven't failed yet. Should our coup succeed, then I shall take that as a sign that I was destined to do this.\"\n\nBodin merely lied there for the rest of the day, waiting for the noise of radio static and trying to think of as little as possible to ease his mind. After a few hours, he turned to his comforts, and took as many substances as he had on him at the time.\nHe sat calmly in a chair, waiting by the radio as he sank further and further into inebriation. Hours later, through the warbled noise of reality, he heard the distinct noise of radio static. He couldn't make out the exact message, but he heard the three words he needed to hear: \"Riverside… Operation… Successful…\"\n\nHe smiled as he slumped to the floor, finally knowing that his victory was preordained from the start."
CAL.16.a:0 "As it should be."
CAL.18.title:0 "The Horror! The Horror!"
CAL.18.desc:0 "Sinclair half-fell backward into his armchair as the message on the radio began to loop, feeling his stomach drop to somewhere on the ground floor. When he'd heard the first gunshots earlier in the evening, he hadn't wanted to believe it was happening - when the intermittent gunfire returned, he'd opened - fervently - that it was the national guard entering the city to put down Bodin's gang of robber-barons and Hollywood twits.  But it seemed like their paramilitaries and the former Federal troops who'd bought into… whatever it was that the Spiritualists stood for had been enough to overcome whatever resistance they'd encountered in Riverside.\nAnd there was nothing he could do about it. Whatever toughs he could scrounge together from EPIC-affiliated unions and student groups would be no match for trained soldiers, even if it would be possible to gather them in time to matter. Even if the Guard only put the bourgeois parties of the United Front back in power, at least he'd have the chance to take power in the next election cycle. But the Spiritualists would no doubt cease to hold public elections - the lunatic Christians had stolen a march on him; they'd moved too quickly for him to gain control of the new-born nation of California. He'd heard Bodin describe the American economy as sacred in the past, and given who supported them, they'd no doubt keep the system in its present form, or even worsen its exploitation of the proletariat. Poverty would persist - he'd let his chance to implement true socialism slip through his fingers.\nRising to unsteady feet, he made his way to the Cellarette, uncorked a bottle without looking, and took several deep gulps. Tomorrow would come, and perhaps there would be something he could do to salvage something from the situation. Bodin was insane - surely he had no chance of holding power for more than a few months. Sinclair took another drink. His day would come, surely. He just needed to wait. But maybe the best place to do that was somewhere outside of the reach of Bodin's cronies."
CAL.18.a:0 "It'll be alright, I'm sure."
CAL.19.title:0 "Renegade"
CAL.19.desc:0 "Something unprecedented, bringing horror to every average person in California, was that the true laws of their time would be dictated by esoteric, fledging and young celebrities with great ambition. This reality maddened some, aroused others' spirits, and to one man, made him lose faith in the nation he had helped create.\n\n Culbert Olson, a man known for being extremely anti-radical, realized the only choice would be to back the Mormon State against the Californian Spiritual Dictatorship, being that it had quickly become fact that his political career was collapsing.\n It's funny, even, that even under Sinclair at least, he'd be able to be opposition."
CAL.19.a:0 "Not here."
CAL.21.title:0 "Against Fate"
CAL.21.desc:0 "Fate had destroyed America. The golden, shining city on a hill, had befallen to the snakes of Anarchism and Communism, where people of good standing were destroyed by populist agents. Millions will die - And America's spirit will forever fly freely, even if it has died in this World. \"We allowed Communists to seize power - We allowed them to destroy our way of life, and... And..!\"\n Bodin said worryingly, not knowing what to extend his words with. Perhaps there was nothing to say."
CAL.21.a:0 "Perhaps only crying worked."
CAL.24.title:0 "The Remnant of the Pacific Fleet"
CAL.24.desc:0 "Multiple flotillas and ships have sided with the Californian state, usually due to pragmatism. However, with our placement into power, a few have begun to feel like they have a purpose - to bring the truths of the Spirit World and the Physical World to America, and hopefully the rest of the Planet. However, one of our most important affairs to resolve right now is restoring all true territories of America - and that includes Hawaii. Originally just a pet project for national expansion, we have decided it will be necessary to find the exotic beaches of Hawaii as part of our society, with good standing people traveling to it in service of ensuring a better standard of life. Therefore, we shall begin our process of taking it for ourselves."

CAL.28.desc:0 "The very Reincarnation of Jean Bodin had been sitting right in front of the young L Ron Hubbard, two mystics and Holy Spirits, which had been awakened and dragged from obscurity and relative quiet life to total power by the enlightenment of the White Californian, who understood that along with their need for self-survival as a separate Western nation distinct from all others and completely independently-functioning, one that is able to project itself on the World Stage and subsequently express that Holy sense of ethnicity and Race into less fortunate areas, and like so the two mystics thought quietly on top of a mountain in the hot Sierra Nevada desert - the great place of Challenge for the Pioneers of the Race, of the Hyperborean, the places of great enlightenment. Wearing nothing but white robes that reflected the Sun's light and lit off rainbows against the sky. The wind gently touched their bodies and they removed their glasses, hats, and all other accessories, only feeling their long hairs against the wind as their spirits went into Astral Projection - and from then on, they met the Hyperborean world, where the original Alien Pre-Humans had come from, and then a vision of horror of the many Teegeeack which began invading the Earth. Subsequently, in this holy realm beyond Thrace, they looked around and saw constellations, galaxies, and other gorgeous planets. \n\n And then, Bodin told Hubbard; \"My child, we are not from this World; we are beyond Human, in fact, as Humanity entails Teegeeack-ness, and Ape-likeness. It is nescessary, that to reach Enlightenment, one must transcend beyond their Humanity, and live free. The Hyperboreans live in constant conflict with outside forces, be they Thetans or be they Ape. We must rise beyond the Human label and become Galactic: To become the Sixth Root Race; the culmination of all Anglo-Saxon expressions in California.\""

CAL.30.title:0 "Battle of Los Angeles"
CAL.30.desc:0 "This evening, at 7:18pm, something had happened which was without precedent - it appeared that aliens finally contacted us.\n\nNear Hollywood itself, in the coast of Los Angeles, our searchlights began to take aim at something of an entity, some kind of flying saucer, hovering above the golden beaches of California. This flying saucer did not appear to attack, and so we did not either. It continued to slowly move from one place to the other, though some other accounts claim it was whizzing around, resulting in dissonant orders from the searchlights - this was most likely some kind of deception tactic by the controller of the flying saucer, who has beyond-this-earth powers. It quickly dissipated into the black sky and into the stars as elderly people had heart attacks and others were ecstatic as the first contact of the Earth from Aliens was finally witnessed. Perhaps it was high time we start calling for them more, and try to secure a stable link of communication with these extraterrestrials."
CAL.30.a:0 "Can you imagine what they look like?"
CAL.33.title:0 "Battle of La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles"
CAL.33.desc:0 "Local Catholics across Los Angeles were horrified today to hear that Bodin himself had denounced them, and proclaimed a war against the Catholic Church for repressing the good freedom of Christians to figure out their own ideas of Christianity. Therefore, many had boarded themselves up and prepared for the battle to the death with the Government, while a few others surrendered for the meagre compensation they'd receive for the destruction of their gorgeous and delicate churches, some even reaching 200 years of existence. However, one church in particular had armed itself to the teeth, and kept it's position and autonomy from the Government for months until a planned raid was about to occur. Thirty or so priests and deacons had prepared themselves with weapons, many of them Hispanic and considered the biggest enemy of the Golden Realm. Not only this church had a Spanish name, but was in the middle of beloved Los Angeles. This cannot be - and so a local convoy of militias, officially not part of the Government, called the \"Longstreet Battalion\" had finished their usual tasks of beating up zoot-suited Hispanics, and instead prepared to fight the greatest fight they had yet - those thirty armed priests and deacons ready to die for their Church. Inside this particular church, the Church of Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles, existed tripwire, sharp metals, and many bullets. At least, as many bullets as they could hold on to. And so, the Longstreet Battalion barged in through the use of explosive TNT, and began to fire with automatic weapons against the poorly-armed priests and churchgoers. As they got shot, they cried, screamed, moaned, and thought of their families. Yet, it was no use, as the few casualties on the Spiritualist side had resulted in nearly the entire church being wiped out of hostiles. The Church was then cleared for zoning of a new cinema set."

CAL.35.title:0 "기독교 위에 개신교"
CAL.35.desc:0 "The Reincarnation of Jean Bodin thought about the development of the American Experiment and the beauty of it as a beacon of Holy Protestantism, and how subsequently it fell to chaos and death - how the largest Protestant country in the World died at the hands of Anarchists, and yet the Protestants undyingly labor every single day to protect individual freedom, individual expression, and the rights protected by Capitalism, the sacred ideas of Protestantism - like it's work ethic, the Blue Laws, all these things which in any other world would not exist outside of Nordic countries, an increasingly endangered final example of Hyperborean civilization. Sadly, California is the one to hold the Scepter and move forward - as the rest of America falls to ungood Papism and vile Atheism, as a great sea of Red Socialism destroys what centuries of Protestant culture and ethics allowed to exist. Russia, for example, considered Sacred by many Eastern Europeans, lives as the largest Orthodox country in the world, and yet it is at the seams of death. It seems that every opposition to Catholics and Socialists is dying, and one final stand must be done - and that is the most radical choice possible - put Protestantism above Christianity itself. \n\n Perhaps it is mistaken to think of the Protestant culture as only Christian, instead of being possible as compatible with new religious movements which spring up everyday in our Holy California by virtue of said Protesstant Culture. Perhaps it is high time that Protestantism splits off from Christianity completely."

One of the ideas presented, called Dianetics, was presented as a way to remove the Thetans which plague the singular soul of a person and give them various ailments. People suffer immensely without L Ron Hubbard's knowledge, and with his immense benevolence, he has decided to make an entire book on Dianetics freely available to be distributed across California as an introductory piece to the party line regarding spirituality. Regardless, the ideas within Excalibur, the more obscure and \"forbidden\" book to \"lower OT level\" audiences, itself are downright pagan; there is nothing in them that talks about Christ or God, and instead focus moreso on direct situations of spirituality that can be adressed and cared for, such as the Thetans, and the whole situation regarding the origin of Humanity, which L Ron Hubbard believes is of the story of the Galactic Confederacy, where their Dictator, Xenu, had brought billions of Teegeeack to Earth and subsequently stacked them around Volcanoes, then killed them with enormous bombs of unimagined, alien scale. The thetans, or immortal spirits of these creatures attach to humans and create several ailments and diseases, such as anxiety, panic disorder, schizophrenia, etcetera. These ideas are incredibly esoteric and most people are not ready for it yet, but the Hollywood aristocracy has long shared them around since even before California became independent, and we shall begin slowly filtering people into understanding the truth of Humanity's origins, step by step."

The military men, in typical fashion, arrived in single-file, all pouring out of their armored cars at once. They saluted Bodin, who made no delay in dismissing them. To him, this whole rigid structure and procedure made the Californian Spiritual Army entirely too un-spiritual. However, this was about to change.\n\nBodin began to speak as the uniformed officers stepped over the young female disciples who were littered about the hallway, all on a unique mind-altering substance, and into his office.\"Gentlemen,\" he began.\n\"Thank you for joining me on such short notice. As you are no doubt unaware, the tactics and operations of our army were adopted from the most advanced theorists in the United States military. Our strategies are supreme in all the world, and in combination with our bountiful natural resources and access to the Pacific, few who dare oppose us have the means to do so.\"The men in Bodin's captive audience settled in for a long, dramatic rant, as that's how these meeting typically went.\n\n\"But isn't something still… lacking?

It never stops itching.\n\n\"The minds that designed these army doctrines knew much of the physical realm, but what if the metaphysical, the imperceptible? That is something only true Californians can understand. We already offer spiritual enhancement to civilians in every street corner, why not subsidize it for military production? Then, and only then could we fight on every plane of reality.\"\n\"YES!\" The man who was scratching his hand stands a bit too quickly, and claps a bit too loudly. His comrades look to him in shock, and even Bodin himself seems taken aback, albeit receptive to the enthusiasm. After a few moments however, more officers begin to stand, with only the most traditionalist generals staying seated.

What can be learned from long-lived republics in our history? Even the Founding Fathers of the Union were cognizant that their experiment, successful as it was for over a century, required a safeguard against the passions of the mob, lest they break down the institutional expertise and stability in the system.\n\nSome suggested a direct vote for the President of the Republic. Others believed in a parliamentary system where whoever held the majority of the Senate would also hold the executive. What we are adopting, however, is our very own incarnation of the American Electoral College. Whichever candidate receives the most electoral votes, which are allocated by district to who has the most votes in each, will win the election. To ensure bipartisanship, the process of drawing the districts will be handled by a committee of the two largest parties in the Senate.\nAnd so, fringe, undemocratic movements in our centers of population, who do not have adequate appeal throughout the rest of the state, will have to learn to work within our institutions."

The liberal Republican was apparently instrumental in helping get the left wing of his party on board with the United Front in the early days of the Republic.\nIt seems that California is heading in an overall liberal direction in line with the pre-war Republican Party.

With Californian food exports still important, there is at least some room in the agriculture industry for people who need a job.

A lot of people liked it, because they understood that I have never wanted to be the Governor of this grand state. In those times I was renowned for the one thing I am well at, writing. I love California, I love her people, I love her luscious valleys and farms, but I have known from a young age that this state has a terrible secret. Millions live in absolute destitution caused by the callous and close-minded minds of rich old business executive based in Sacramento running over the good people in this state. I, being the naive man of the age of the great Gilded, after a brief scuffle with some police officers while trying to organize, decided in a fit of both wisdom and cowardice, that I was unsuited for political life and could only hope to change the system via encouraging others with my writing. A year passed by, then decades. While I could see quite clearly that my writing had indeed changed a lot of good people's minds on fixing this broken system, I slowly began to realize that the Grand Progressives in the Capitol and in state politics were only using my work as a means to gain votes, not to actually carry on the torch of reform. In 1934 I got so sick of the whole matter that I signed up with the Jobless Progressive Party to try and win that a way, and though we were close, we did not win in California. But we are not in 1934 anymore. Things have only gotten worse and it is completely clear to me that we have got to fix it. I already decided what I were to do if I were the Governor of California, I can now say with certainty that I am, and now all that's left to do is to answer the question \"When I was Governor of California...\"."

Keppler was a known supporter of full public education, and as the superintendent of Los Angeles County he had made no mistake as to his excitement for such a reformer entering the governorship. As the two men got to conversation, Sinclair quickly turned the subject to the matter of schooling, \"Mr. Keppler I think it is safe to assume from what you have said that you, as much as any man, value the right of children to have an education. That is why I want to let you know that we are about to unveil our new school policy, and while it does sound a bit radical, I hope that you and I can both agree that it is absolutely necessary. There are millions of children and young adults in this state that can't afford to have a secondary education and I think you know how horrible this deprivation of an experience is for them. That is why we have decided within Sacramento to begin issuing free public education all the way until post-graduate and even beyond should the student so choose. I hope we can have your full backing on this.\" Keppler rose from his seat. He had valued a public education for as long as he could remember, even going to back to when he was a simple high school teacher. But this? What Sinclair was proposing was more radical then even he as a student at UCLA could have dreamt up. Did he say free tuition all the way up to post-graduate? Taking a second to compose himself he then gave a warm smile to the most powerful man in California and thanked him for his efforts, though the entire time after they had both left his office, he couldn't shake the feeling he had made a terrible mistake."

Morgan inherited his father's general store just on the right of Main Street and has ran it ever since his passing in 1921. For the last few years Morgan has lived a simple yet fulfilling life as a well-liked, well respected, and moderately wealthy shopkeeper in a pretty little town in a nice state filled with kindly and good people. Mr. Morgan had some troubles with the Great Depression with business drying up rather quickly, but being the kindly neighbour that he is, he was sure to lower the prices of his goods or even give them out for free to the honest working people who needed it. Mr. Morgan was never quite one for politics and never joined any party, he saw no need too, for he knew everyone from the JPP to the Technocrats and knew they would be good enough. Things continued on for Mr. Morgan, until the collapse of the nation and the death of the United States. Things didn't change all that much in his material circumstances, but he had grown up with respect and love of his country. His soon carefree and optimistic nature on politics evaporated, and Mr. Morgan became one of the most anti-socialist people in his village, and well renown for refusing service to any JPP member that had, in his mind, betrayed his country. The poor man soon became melancholic and nostalgic. He was a harsh campaigner for Olson's United Front, and openly sought to do everything in his power to end the \"Reds\" from taking office in his county. Though for all poor Mr. Samuel P. Morgan tried to do, Mr. Sinclair was elected to the Governorship anyhow. Mr. Morgan's melancholy and anger grew, until the traitor came to his own town. He could see the smug fag right outside his shop window. After Sinclair finished up his little speech about how he was supposedly \"fighting for the little guy\" and seeing many supporters cheering him on, he found himself in a deep unquenchable sense of hopelessness and melancholy. Thus, he went to the back of his shop, grabbed the old New Army he kept around, and begged God for the situation to improve for his country, people, and family."

His latest plans on workers' rights' were bound to have some of the most intense kickback out of any of his policies so far, and so he decided to have a meeting with Mr. Robert McCgider, the Vice Executive Officer, in order to smooth things over. As he walked up to the man's offices he couldn't help but sweat a little. As he entered the office, McCgider seemed to be rather cross as he sat down opposite of his desk. The two men shook hands, and much to Sinclair's dread, McCgider began the conversation first. \"Governor, thanks for coming down here to discuss this brand new policy your party has been cooking up, though I'm sure as you and I both know it's not going to be very condusive to our company.\", McCgider said with a very obvious bout of annoyance and poor expectation for what was coming. Sinclair, though normally not one for confrontation, felt irritated at the prim arrogant executive who sat accross him. All the rightous anger that led him to write and then speak filled him until he soon had a confidence to match Mr. McCgider. \"I see we're skipping the pleasentries Mr. McCgider, so right to bussiness then. I came down here today to inform you that a bill is soon going to be passed. A very incredible bill that I was personally on the drafting commitee for and has unamious support within my party, which has a majority in both houses of legislature. The bill in question will give workers, especially railroad workers, such things as an 8 hour workday, paid vacation, the unquestioned right to form a union, and much to my personal delight, a mandate that each worker must be given atleast one share in the company in which he is employed. I came down here this fine afternoon to inform you of this so your company can make the necessary adjustments to conform to this new piece of legislation. If you have no further questions, I'll be leaving then.\" McCgider could hardly believe what he had just heard. He knew he was not going to enjoy this meeting, but the Governor had stunned him with the sheer radicalness of the plan. The numbers of such regulation reeling in his head, he soon locked eyes with Sinclair, \"No.\" he said. \"I do not Governor.\" \"Alright then. Have a good day then.\""

Got to meet with the Governor today.\" This was a bad sign. Kathlein knew that Robert had no love of Upton Sinclair, and him personally going down to his office meant that it was to inform him of a new policy, something that, knowing the Governor's rhetoric and record, was sure not to go over well with her spouse. \"And how was that?\" Robert, now pouring himself a glass of Scotch, took a big sigh. \"About as well as you could expect. Man's got a penchent for proposing big things, and today was none the different. A mandatory eight hour workday, mandatory worker owned shares, mandatory paid vacation time, soon they're bill mandatory daily picnics and mandatory worker sporting clubs. We're set to lose big, today I got screamed at for such a blunder, \"Negotiate!\" they said after I broke the news. Negotiate what? The man was absolutely hellbent on this new thing he's doing, I could see it in his eyes honey, he was going to have his way no matter what, and I don't want our company to be remembered the next time there's an inspection sweep going around. I'm sure that we can get by it, but I'm old enough already and I don't want this company to go belly up because of this, you know?\" Kathlein soon felt much better. Things had been rough for her baby, and he was just a little peeved, nothing a good deal of love and care couldn't fix in him. Smiling warmly she expressed empathy at his situation, and offered to make him a big ham tonight for super."

No, they want us to believe that Christ already won and that any resistence would be madness, BUT THEY ARE WRONG! Just because Christ failed does not mean that we will! Led by our new Messiah Edward Bodin we will pick up where he left off and will not rest until THE ETERNAL WAR OF DEMON VS GOD IS WON ONCE AND FOR ALL!"

Just as our comrades in France have unleashed the potential of the cinema in showing the world the true path, so must we show the world learn about the real nature of the worlds; and Hollywood is the place to start! Though of course all anti-American forces will have to be merticulusly cut from the cloth before we start, once it is finished, the 'movie' industry as it now being called will blossom into a blinding light that the world cannot help but look in awe!"

So, let us end them in a true showing of Anglo-Saxon spirit, and MARCH AGAINST THEM! All across California the Cathedrals will be closed, the indoctrination centers shut down forever, and an entire generation freed from the shackles of Rome! But we would twice the fool if we just assumed that simply not allowing them to openly act would end them, no no no! The Papist Hydra has corrupted too much and has indirectly stolen too many innocent Anglo-Saxon Spirits.
