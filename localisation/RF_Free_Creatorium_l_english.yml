#Focuses
FCR_message_for_mankind:0 "A New Message for Mankind"
FCR_message_for_mankind_desc:0 "The strangest of circumstances surrounds us now in the wake of the Great War. The old world lies now, decaying, like the bloated corpse that it is. Yet the new world thrashes against its chains, to be born. But now, out of the anarchy and ash, the angels of humanity have risen, calling out to the world of a new dawn for all mankind! The weight of centuries will disappear, as we march onwards to a new tomorrow where no man shall suffer!"

FCR_against_the_capital:0 "Against the Idiocy of Capitalism"
FCR_against_the_capital_desc:0 "The delusions of this world fundamentally have their source at one despicable ideology. That of Capitalism. While the events of recent years have begun to peel away at its hegemony, it's wretched influence still plagues the world. But we shall banish its remnants wherever they may be! So let it then be known that this land we have carved out for ourselves shall be a shining bastion against the idiocy of Capitalism!"

FCR_against_grave_worship:0 "Against the Sin of Grave-Worship"
FCR_against_grave_worship_desc:0 "The tenants of organised religions such as Christianity and other Abrahamic faiths serve one key goal. To pacify the workers of the world through Grave-Worship. Any normal man would shut up and accept the suffering they must experience in this world if they believe that at the end of it all comes Utopia, this promised land of unending ecstasy and happiness. Just as importantly, these faiths deny that a glorious and eternal golden age of life is possible in the material world, and so, the workers of the lands of faith have become worshipers of the grave. They lie unaware that in death they will find only oblivion and that immortality is indeed possible on this Earth.\n\nLet us rectify these errors and work to dismantle the institutions that cast such delusions over the world and set out to prove we can build a utopia for all on our own little world."

FCR_for_the_stars:0 "For the Stars That Gave Us Birth"
FCR_for_the_stars_desc:0 "We recognise that as all humanity - we are the children of the stars. Our minds were born from the immense fires of these celestial forges, we all sustain on astral energy - through one way or another. And it is finally the time to reclaim our birthright! From the stars we were born and to stars we shall return. We cast a challenge to our ancient forefathers - as it came the time for men of the Earth to awake and expand their life to the Cosmos."

FCR_for_freedom:0 "And for Freedom!"
FCR_for_freedom_desc:0 "Progress means nothing if it is achieved by slavers, and if the workers of the world live in misery and poverty! Our endeavours in the future must be orientated around this idea. That our goal is for the freedom of humanity! Not for the sake of some phoney nation or despotic red bureaucrats! So let our message ring from the plains of Manchuria, let it cover the world in its glory! For the death knell of bondage and servitude can be heard at last!"

FCR_faith_progress:0 "Faith in Progress"
FCR_faith_progress_desc:0 "Christianity supposes that man is half-angel and half-animal; while this may be true today, it was not always the case. Man started as an animal alone, no more special than any other beast with one exception — in man's heart is a desire for progress. His faith in progress is what caused man to create all we see today, all that elevates him above nature. Through progress, man has increased his angelicness and decreased his beastialness, and we will continue until men are of Gods, powered by his faith not in a God above him but in his own eventual godliness."

FCR_faith_creativity:0 "Faith in Creativity"
FCR_faith_creativity_desc:0 "The physical process of creation, production, is the very essence of what life is. Since we are life's most stalwart defenders, we must be the most stalwart defenders of creativity as well. The living individual, the figure at the very basis of Biocosmism, is born with the spark towards creation. Instrumentally towards this end, he develops an aversion to Death, the ultimate destroyer of creation. Faith in creativity is thus not only faith in creativity, but faith in ourselves."

FCR_perfect_living_individual:0 "To Perfect the Living Individual"
FCR_perfect_living_individual_desc:0 "One of the great chains that bind living organisms is the despotism of fixed forms. An egg has infinite potential, but once it has developed into a fully grown creature it loses this potential. The living being is trapped in a body it may grow tired of. This is a brazen affront to freedom which we cannot allow. We will make the expansion of bodily autonomy one of our top priorities, as we are doing with death. For what is the purpose of immortal life if it must be lived in a body that is not of your own free choice."

FCR_techno_anarchism:0 "Techno-Anarchism"
FCR_techno_anarchism_desc:0 "We can never let the retrogrades and bourgeoisie fool humanity into thinking how they used to live was acceptable or normal or how the world will always be. Through the utilisation of technology and automation we will work to build a world where no one will have to work or suffer. Capitalist and authoritarian inventions and mentalities have seeped into much of the world, such that for some, it has become easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.\n\nBut all of these remnants and superstitions of the old world will be done away with! The idea that utopia cannot be forged will be shattered! Through the power of technology humans and animals alike will, through our efforts, one day whisper of myths and tales of suffering, predation and servitude. Automation will ensure that no one will need to work in order to live and through technological advancement all suffering will one day be eliminated. So rejoice, all living things of the universe! Your freedom will soon dawn!"

FCR_immortality_beyond_space:0 "Immortality Beyond the State"
FCR_immortality_beyond_space_desc:0 "Some of our colleagues have misunderstood the goal of the doctrine of Biocosmism. They believe the keys to immortality are to be found by vesting more power in the state. We have difficulty understanding why our colleagues believe that empowering an institution which has killed more people than any other would be the path to immortality and we, of course, have a different path charted out.\n\nImmortality will not be achieved in a despotic manner, forced from the top down, but as an organic bottom up process in which each increase in lifespan is paired with an increase in liberty. No coercion will be required to make people work for their freedom, as the reward will be directly given to the workers: eternal life."

FCR_future_perfection:0 "The Future Perfection"
FCR_future_perfection_desc:0 "Due to how truly revolutionary the doctrine of Biocosmism is, it has been difficult to communicate the ultimate scope of the project we are embarking on to the masses. Most believe it is summed up in two points: Immortalism and Interplanetarism. While we must also stress Resurrection as the third maximal pillar, these are merely the logical expressions of our actual quest, which is both more broad and more simple than any of these three points.\n\nOur quest is, and forevermore will be, the expression of life. Since the first cell divided, since the first neuron fired, the doctrine of Biocosmism was already implicit. The ultimate goal is to fill the dead cosmos with life ordered under rational consciousness."

FCR_war_against_nature:0 "The War Against Nature"
FCR_war_against_nature_desc:0 "We are in a constant state of war - not only against our enemies, but against the very malignant forces that surround us. Walking the treacherous road we need to be full of courage, but wary - for the enemy strikes with mindless brutality. What our Creatorium is is not just a free space of self-creation, it is a battlefield - and every follower of our Common Task is a soldier. In the war against nature we require a cunning strategy, a religious discipline and a great symbol to unite us all. In a world of chaos, we will be the first true army in mankind's greatest struggle - leading it to the infinity of its victory."

FCR_bogdanov_legacy:0 "Legacy of Bogdanov"
FCR_bogdanov_legacy_desc:0 "Comrade Bogdanov's disappearance in the recent chaos has deeply concerned the Creatorium. While we hope that he has not fallen into the icy grips of our grave enemy Death, it cannot be ruled out. If so, we must make a note to put him at the top of the list of those to be resurrected. Bogdanov's surprise disappearance left those of us who followed him and his party without a home. The Free Creatorium will be the new home for all those who followed the Vperedist cause."

FCR_total_production_control:0 "Total Control Over Production"
FCR_total_production_control_desc:0 "An economy left up to the chaotic contradictions and anarchy of the market is not one that can be reliably expected to look after its people. The often short sighted interests of Capitalists and businessmen lead to growing poverty and inequality and set the road for economic disaster and turmoil. We shall be the ones to break this cycle of so-called "boom and bust". Through an extensive campaign of nationalisation, we wrestle control all aspects of production from the individuals and whatever capitalist roaders we maybe unfortunate enough to find. In doing so, we will be able to form a cohesive economy that works wholly for the wellbeing of us all!"

FCR_custodianship_of_the_earth:0 "Custodianship Over Earth"
FCR_custodianship_of_the_earth_desc:0 "The resources of the Earth - its air, its waters, the minerals of its crust - are too precious to be left to the mindless forces of nature. Our task requires that humanity will undertake a regulatory role over the Earth. The ecosystems created through evolution are by nature unstable, headed towards certain doom - to save the beauty of life, humanity needs to take conscious, rational action. In the future we will aim to control weather, master the very energy of the atom, and bring all life on earth under the protection of our grand empire - where it will be steered by a strong hand and brilliant mind, towards the conquest of the Universe."

FCR_enlighten_bandits:0 "Enlighten the Bandits"
FCR_enlighten_bandits_desc:0 "The Russian and Ukrainian settlers are not the only people to inhabit this slice of Asia. In the aftermath of the collapse of the phoney bourgeois republic, the Manchurian natives had formed their own little territory of bandits and peasants. Now that we have liberated this land, it is time for us to show the Manchus a way out of their sorry state and into a new enlightenment. Onwards to a utopia greater than we will ever know we shall help them march! And how glorious we will all be in unison! A shining example to the world of how we shall leave behind the superstitions and evils of nationalism, into a great new genesis!"

FCR_friends_or_enemy:0 "Friends or Enemies"
FCR_friends_or_enemy_desc:0 "Over the corpse of the old republic springs a new experiment in its capital; the Gastev-Rosenbaum clique is attempting to build some sort of strange market-syndicalist synthesis. While obviously superior to the vipers of reaction and ethnic narcissism that plague the rest of the republic's corpse, it is clearly not equal to the Creatorium, the only path to resurrection. However, despite its inferiority to us, there is something undeniably intriguing about the endeavour. Perhaps with the proper negotiations we could come to an agreement with the two. For what is the purpose of individualism if the individual is destined to die, and what is progress if it does not aim for the stars?"

FCR_immortality_to_far_east:0 "Immortality, to the Far East!"
FCR_immortality_to_far_east_desc:0 "We stand now, as a shining beacon of utopia among the rotten and festering corpses of the old bourgeois republic. For now, our efforts of liberation have been restricted to small border skirmishes with bandits and warlords. But the time for peace is over! The time has come at last for us to strike at all those who stand in the way of our eternal mission! First we shall bring immortality to the Far East, and from there, THE WORLD!"

FCR_crematorium_tradition:0 "A Crematorium of Traditions"
FCR_crematorium_tradition_desc:0 "The dogmatic and religious worship of the practices of long dead generations have plagued humanity for thousands of years. Even now, the horrid nature of such a thing bares itself naked to the world to see, but few seem ready to abandon the practices of old. But we shall serve the world as a guiding light! To free this world from the abhorrent evil of the practices of long dead ghosts.\n\nAs such, let us burn this world in a purifying flame! So that we may birth a new utopia from the embers and ashes of a million devils and their commandments!"

FCR_united_labour_church:0 "United Labour Church"
FCR_united_labour_church_desc:0 "What the people need is a new idea to drive them forward — a new, true religion, a symbol. But what religion remains in the modern world? The burning light of new knowledge has passed unmerciful judgement on the superstitions of the past: yet does that mean that the modern man has to remain without purpose? No! The building of humanity's common destiny shall be the new religion! In labour, in the common striving to the stars we will find our new God – a new gospel will be announced on every street, every factory will become a temple. For the wise one know, what our endeavour here really is, a workshop of true divinity. From the humble origins in the backwater Manchuria – humanity will soon rise to a new race of Gods."

FCR_new_alchemists:0 "The Alchemists of Today"
FCR_new_alchemists_desc:0 "For all the talk about casting away the hideous monuments of the old world, there is one thing a few know: the seeds of our ideas were sown in the ancient days. In the work of the alchemists of old - the core ideal of our great endeavour was carried. That of transfiguration, the carrying of matter to divinity. And so the furnaces of our temple have lit up, and by their heat we labour ceaselessly to create the noblest gold out of the lead of the world around us."

FCR_for_order:0 "And for Order!"
FCR_for_order_desc:0 "The primary task of our project of re-organisation of the Universe is the introduction of Order. Where once reigned entropy and the chaotic idiocy of the dark, blind forces we will introduce conscious power, that shall remake the world as a rational, ordered machine. The true expression of human creativity will not then be anarchy, the raving mob but a perfect State - Cosmocracy. A State where humanity, led by its scientific and intellectual elite, will be finally able to tame the rogue bull of Nature, and create the world anew. Let the legions of the New Order march proudly - and bury the old world under their mighty boot!"

FCR_time_mastery:0 "Mastery Over Time"
FCR_time_mastery_desc:0 "The ultimate goal of our project is total mastery over time, that is - production of eternity. While other empires crumbled into dust sooner or later, this will not be the case for us - as we are the ultimate destiny of mankind. What we plan to achieve is immortality, but not only for our bodies, but for our entire civilization in the Universe. In the realm of ultimate mastery over time - the universe will be ours to shape like soft clay, we will become the greatest of artists, stars themselves being our canvas."

FCR_space_mastery:0 "Mastery Over Space"
FCR_space_mastery_desc:0 "If we are to bring immortality and utopia to the world, we cannot do it while we are stuck to small corners of the globe, moving slowly from A to B. What we must strive for is a form of mastery over space by expanding our ability to move throughout it in all possible directions. The practices of the old days, of horses and of carriages, shall be discarded! We have some form of technology required to ensure rapid communications and travels between cities and nations. But we cannot rest with just laying however many kilometres of railway. We must begin to develop the uses of flight even more, beyond the limitations of our time.\n\nWho is to say? Perhaps someday soon, shuttles from the heartlands of the world will take to the skies and into the eternal reaches of space! Men everywhere will see and look on in pride at the sight of what we have accomplished, as we claim a final victory over the universe!"

FCR_improvement_humanity_institute:0 "Institute for the Improvement of Mankind"
FCR_improvement_humanity_institute_desc:0 "It is unacceptable to say that our task of the conquest of nature should end on our surroundings. No - we aim to create an union of immortal beings, thus we need to redefine what it even means to be human. For this we create a new institution: the Institute for the Improvement of Mankind - a body dedicated to taking control of the flesh, bone, and the subtle energies that define our mind. The new institute shall know nothing sacred: a long journey awaits us. While now we can only think of small steps: such as collective health measures or the countrywide implementation of an eugenics program, in the future the Institute shall find the secret key to reshaping the human body, to create a new God-like man: one free of death, knowing powers beyond the imagination of mortals."

FCR_state_beyond_nature:0 "State Beyond Nature"
FCR_state_beyond_nature_desc:0 "The State represents the fulfilment of the human task of taming and conquering nature - itself being a sort of technology, organising human bodies into collective forms. We will harness law, symbolics and pure force to prepare the grid on which we will build the new world that will come to replace nature. For when it is done - there will no longer be laws of nature, and nothing will remain but the laws of the State."

FCR_scientific_totalitarism:0 "Scientific Totalitarism"
FCR_scientific_totalitarism_desc:0 "It is necessary to realise that the world we live in now provides us with possibilities never before conceivable to even the greatest minds of the past! We cannot act like the ignorant and backwards pigs of the rest of the world who refuse to feel the warmth that the infernos of science will give.\n\nSome see science as a field of its own, independent of the realm of politics and social organisation. But this is merely the view of the close-minded man, who cannot fathom the birth of a new age! Through the application of scientific principles in organisation shall birth a new world. Total control over nature and a newly animated world shall follow! The world shall bend and fold a thousand times over as we begin a genesis of a society where every man works, acts, and lives in tandem to accomplish feats and progress on a level never before seen!"

FCR_modern_methamorphosis:0 "The Modern Metamorphosis"
FCR_modern_methamorphosis_desc:0 "The world as generations knew it is no more – the iron fires of factories rearranged the basic elements of the universe. We're entering a new era. Before our eyes, nature is becoming history. Let us become the agent of universal change! Wherever we steep, the new order of the world will be known. The Church and State becoming one - the cultural and the political fulfilling itself in an unbreakable marriage. Everything, every old institution and an antiquated phantasm of the mind melting before our eyes, the only thing left: naked Truth. An enlightenment – the reborn humanity, the task of redemption fulfilled. Finding truth and beauty neither in the ignorance of Eden, nor in the hardships of Earth, mankind will claim its prize in the stars."

FCR_siberian_revolution:0 "Revolution in Siberia"
FCR_siberian_revolution_desc:0 "The first steps of the metamorphosis of man have been completed. The masses of the Far East have been cleansed in ever-lasting visions of a new tomorrow! But our job is not yet done! Now we must turn our faces West! To the Tundras and plains of the North!\n\nFor now, Siberia lies firmly in the hands of despots and reactionary demagogues. Like a purifying flame, we shall burst into what shall soon be the graveyards of the Tsarist dogs and luddite thugs! Thousands of thousands look to us for the future and for a new paradise! We shall not disappoint. We may still have a long way to go from the corners of the globe, but let us raise our heads with pride as our banners proudly fly in the winds of a new Genesis!"

#LEADER BIOS 

FCR_alexander_yaroslavsky_desc:0 "When Nikolai Fyodorov put the ideals of Cosmism to paper in the 19th century, could he have expected such a following? And under these circumstances? When the revolutionary fortunes during the Russian Civil War were at their lowest, there emerged a movement of intellectuals known as the Biocosmists who called for a quasi-anarchist agenda of immortality. Surrounded by so much death, one can only imagine why someone like Alexander Yaroslavsky would attach himself to Svyatogor's "Creatorium" and its utopian goals.\n\nYaroslavsky, while not the paramount figure of Biocosmism, and not an RSDRP member, was a member of several Vperedist cultural organizations in the previous decades. Once the Republic had found an uneasy peace, he continued this role as an evangelist in the streets of Harbin, organizing poetry readings and public speeches to bring people toward socialism and the Fyodorovian Common Task. His themes were as one would expect from the man who made his first mark on the Biocosmist scene with a long poem about cryogenic preservation of the human body - what could be done through the power of technology and the human spirit.\n\nWhile he was far from heretical within the Vperedist cultural sphere, the errant poet would probably have remained an activist were it not for the tripartite beheading of the Biocosmist movement, the RSDRP, and Zheltorossiya itself. With Svyatogor briefly indisposed and a sudden void of authority opened in the center of the republic, it fell to what remained of the party organizations to fend for themselves. Able to rally the masses behind him once more, Yaroslavsky has become the leader of an avowedly Cosmist state. Once more, in the face of certain destruction, there is power in seemingly impossible dreams. The greatest of struggles will end with the greatest of prizes - the end of death and natural necessity, the pursuit of the greatest common good, and an eternity of new, terrifying freedom for mankind."
FCR_valerian_murayev_desc:0 "It is perhaps fitting that Nikolai Fyodorov, the man who birthed Russian Cosmism, was an ascetic intellectual - a librarian who in turn would tutor a similarly reclusive scientist-philosopher. Valerian Muravyev, similarly, is a far cry from a thousand other would-be populist leaders of men in the crucible of Zheltorossiya, being more of an obscure academic author. While never a stirring poet like the other Biocosmist luminaries who rose during the Russian Civil War, Muravyev was an early, faithful member of Svyatogor's "Creatorium." Excited by the potential of a revolution to reinvigorate Russia, he took part in the flight across Siberia with his new philosophical brethren.\n\nWhere some of the Biocosmists turned to art and agitation in the exile Republic, Muravyev found work at Alexei Gastev's Central Institute of Labour. He occupied an esoteric niche within the Institute as well as the Creatorium's publishing houses, uniting scientific organization of labour with philosophical underpinnings of man's mastery over time. While it lacked the drama of public poetry, the vision breathed a spiritual life into Fordist principles and made him a number of allies across the Vperedist sphere.\n\nThe test of his alliances came when Zheltorossiya itself was abolished. Leveraging their bureaucratic expertise and connections, Muravyev's circle of scientists and intellectuals was able to justify holding power in the anarchic center of the dead Republic. What other body would be capable of transforming the state from a realm of law and economics into one of faith and ethics? What could be trusted to cultivate a culture that transcends life and death? What else could realize the Common Task? From on high, the new hermetic order proclaims that the boundaries of what is possible are not absolute. One day, nothing that occurs will be through unconscious processes, but deliberate mastery."

FCR.1.t:0 "The Debate in the Creatorium"
FCR.1.desc:0 "When Biocosmism's first manifesto landed upon this globe, Russia and the world around it were in chaos. Perhaps it is only fitting that now, in a fractal splitting of another Russian splinter state, Biocosmism's adherents gather to take the next step. With the movement's father Alexander Svyatogor a late arrival to the proceedings, the mood is tense as the next generation of leaders argues over his legacy, with the stakes never higher.\n\nBut the Free Creatorium spits on death, disdains its inevitability. Carrying forth the standard of Svyatogor, Alexander Yaroslavsky has been the first to make his case for the overall direction of the struggle. He preaches before a mural of the Cosmist sage Nikolai Fedorov: Maximal creativity. Maximal freedom. The right of all men to eternal life. So will the supposedly natural boundaries on society be destroyed. Despite the necessity of the coming war in his plans, it appears that Yaroslavsky's agitational poetry and art had him well-positioned to rally other militants to his cause in free association.\n\nOf course, other voices decried this as infantilism, risking the Biocosmist  awakening being smothered in its cradle. From the other wing of the movement is Valerian Muravyev, another early adherent of the cause who became a heterodox theorist in Alexei Gastev's Central Institute of Labour. To his followers convinced of the necessity of authoritarian means, the Creatorium must be organized top-down for the coming battles, to better produce materiel for war and to uproot backwardness where it lurks. Led by a scientific-philosophical elite, their earthly bounds will be broken."
