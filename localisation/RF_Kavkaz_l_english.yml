#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
KAV_DESC_MENU:0 "The Red Army, retreating south, fortified their position in the Caucasus. In this easily defensible position they managed to fend off the White attacks. The cornered Bolsheviks needed a strong visionary to guide them in these hard times. Their saviour became none other than Vladimir Mayakovsky, a futurist poet and revolutionary. He reorganised the Red forces in the Caucasus into a republic that became known as the Kavkaz Society - a land of poets and prophets. The Society transcends the divide that brings Europe into flames, instead presenting a synthesis of the two most revolutionary projects of modernity – Futurism and Communism."

KAV_vladimir_mayakovsky_desc:0 "Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky, the iconoclastic herald of acceleration, is the first formally Futurist head of state in the world. It is by some quirk of fate that it would occur in his native land of Georgia. A teenage convert to socialist activism, he was soon drawn into the RSDRP underground, and during a spell in prison, a series of experiments in poetry would begin to shape him into an avowedly socialist artist. Shortly after release, he would make connections in art school that brought him into nascent Russian Futurism, and his poetry was hurled into the urban arts scene as a bomb that would provoke raucous crowds.\n\nBut like it did millions of others, the Great War would change Mayakovsky's life irrevocably. His political reputation saw him turned away from volunteering, but his opposition to the war saw him seek work as a draftsman during later mobilization. When the Russian Civil War broke out, however, Mayakovsky was immediately drawn to the communist wing of the revolutionaries, where he became a propagandist for the cause. Alas, defeat came eventually, and while some of the movement would flee into Zheltorossiya, and others into Eastern Europe, he would find himself in the contingent that escaped into secessionist Georgia and Azerbaijan. Without the core of the RSDRP, and with many other candidates dead in the fields of Kuban, it would be the sect surrounding Mayakovsky that came to dominate the hardened core of the southern revolutionaries. Through cooperation with local communists, the states of the region were overthrown and united into the Caucasian Federation of Soviets in 1920, with the young poet as its first Premier.\n\nOver a decade later, the world of the Kavkaz Society has changed under the revolutionary helmsman. The breakneck modernization, industrialization, and agitation that is now understood as Futurism in practice was codified through his rule. Defiant in their mountain fortress, Mayakovsky's government has created a center of revolutionary art and proletarian culture to rival Fiume, presenting Tbilisi as a shining light in contrast to the oppression and backwardness to the north. However, after so long as a revolutionary, having taken drastic measures to preserve the cause, and having earned the scorn of former inspirations such as Vladimir Lenin, what is left of Vladimir Mayakovsky? What price will Mayakovsky the poet pay for Mayakovsky the revolutionary? And what price can all of Kavkaz pay to free Russia?"
KAV_Velimir_Khlebnikov_desc:0 "Poet. Playwright. Futurologist. Now, Premier. But never boring. Like his predecessor, Velimir Khlebnikov is a man from the south of the Russian Empire, born in Astrakhan Governate and having a touch of Zaporozhian Cossack ancestry. While he would eventually end up in the capital for his studies, he would quickly drop out to focus on his written pursuits. Shortly thereafter, he fell in with the future luminaries of Russian Futurism, and soon he became a distinctive, if eccentric, artistic voice - often forgetting to eat or clothe himself while consumed with work. Speculative essays about the future of technology sat alongside poetic works in convention-defying constructed language.\n\nAnd of course, the Great War upended all manner of plans. Like a number of Futurists, Khlebnikov attached himself to the communists as a fellow utopian and served as a propagandist until the flight into the Caucasus. While his influence would help secure the Futurist-Communist faction's control over the newborn Federation, Mayakovsky ascending to the Premiership may have started the slow divorce of the former compatriots. Khlebnikov and like-minded artists played a great role in shaping the artistic culture of Kavkaz in the coming years, but their esoteric dreams and demands would sometimes clash with the practical realities of governance - with the Premier struggling to manage a coalition government while Kolchak's Russian Empire waited to pounce on any signs of weakness. While Velimir would occasionally be distracted by diplomatic and cultural missions to states like Fiume, the former collaborators would be at loggerheads again as soon as he returned. \n\nIn the end, when Mayakovsky fell, it was the Futurists who would inherit the state he built. But what a madman who would lead the vanguard. In one hand, Premier Khlebnikov promises a world perfected through the harnessing of technology and democratization of knowledge. In his other, fixations on prophecy, numerology, and mythology drive him toward primordial, irrational truths of human meaning. The new futurist man, the Futurian, prepares to walk an Earth turned on its head – but will the Premier's visions prove a dream? Or a delusion?"
KAV_dmitry_mirsky_desc:0 "Russia's Red Prince has earned his second chance. The name of Dmitry Petrovich Svyatopolk-Mirsky is cursed back in the Empire, even by many of his former allies, but it is perhaps poetic that the son of a Georgian princess would come to power here instead. His father, an officer and noble himself, would also serve as Minister of the Interior until shortly before the Great War. Despite these origins, Mirsky gave up his royal title at a young age and devoted himself to literary studies. Like many future luminaries of Kavkaz, he would also become a poet, though in the uncanny and portentous Symbolist style.\n\nUnlike a number of his poetic contemporaries, however, Mirsky would serve in the army throughout the entire war, despite a reprimand and transfer between fronts for suspected defeatism. Crucially, he would remain an imperial loyalist throughout the Civil War. After demobilization, Mirsky became a professor and published author on the subject of Russian literature, but despite his adherence to the Whites, his personal politics would diverge radically from the orthodox monarchists. As a founder of the Eurasianist movement, he would be foregrounded as a member of the ascendent political party SNP, or the Union of National Prosperity. Unfortunately, when the details of his correspondence with notable communists - and his true political beliefs - were leaked in the so-called Mirsky Affair of 1931, he was only spared a lengthy katorga sentence when the train transporting him east was captured by a team sent from the sympathetic Kavkaz Society.\n\nPerhaps only a communist as syncretic as Mirsky could seize the moment after the fall of Mayakovsky. Celebrated for his letters, literary work, and the dramatic circumstances of his arrival, the dispossessed prince easily took to the Kavkazian literary and political scene. No longer needing to conceal his convictions, he added to his revolutionary corpus from the likes of Bogdanovite scientism, the Fiumean political avant-garde, and Bolshevik economic theory. Heralding the coming of a total Eurasian state, the new Premier is ready to begin here what never could be done from St. Petersburg. Today in Eurasia, tomorrow the stars."
KAV_igor_severyanin_desc:0 "Igor Vasilyevich Lotaryov - or Igor Severyanin, on his works - was a dark horse among the other dark horses who competed over Mayakovsky's seat. As his adopted surname would suggest, he was born far from his current refuge, up in St. Petersburg - though he would also spend some time in far-flung Harbin immediately before the war with Japan. Upon returning home, the newly adult Severyanin began self-publishing poetry, but his eventual breakthrough into the public eye would also place him into an uneasy coexistence with his future Kavkazian contemporaries. Dubbing his school of verse "Ego-Futurism," the poet issued a similar call for the complete modernization of art and adoration of the engine, but at the same time would cut a bizarrely aristocratic profile, always slickly dressed and occasionally openly declaring himself a genius.\n\nThough prone to infighting with his fellow Ego-Futurists, Severyanin was relatively content to continue his work until the Russian Civil War. This marked the beginning of an unproductive exile period for the would-be high-society entertainer. Though he would escape the worst fighting and the epicenter of Kolchakite oppression by moving to the Baltics, the stern military government in the region proved as unappealing as the prospect of moving to Germany or Poland. However, when the Caucasian Federation of Soviets proved more than a flash in the pan, the futurist cultural line of the state was too enticing for Severyanin, who immediately started looking to immigrate.\n\nIt was a strange road that brought Severyanin to the premiership, and not everyone in the Kavkazian establishment is pleased. His relatively moderated sensibilities, in contrast to the totalizing visions of his opponents, made him appealing to the segments of society who were alienated by Mayakovsky's proletarian militancy. Certainly, Igor is a man of the future, but the Russia of the future need not dismiss its heroes such as Dostoevsky! His promises of a softened cultural policy, as well as rumblings of economic liberalization, are greeted with relief and displeasure in equal measure. Can this would-be aristocrat overcome the mob within Kavkaz and without? Or will he be pulled under the wheels of the future he claims to steer?"
KAV_iosif_stalin_desc:0 "The old guard of the Bolsheviks has made its position clear - Mayakovsky was an outsider they could work with, but the man who followed him surely was not. But who is the man at their head, besides another native of Georgia? Born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili, Stalin's trajectory was originally of a bright schoolboy who earned a scholarship to a seminary school, but at some point, his attitude toward religion soured. First learning Marxist theory - and a touch of Nietzsche - through a clandestine book club, he would leave to join a local revolutionary organization, and rapidly went underground to avoid arrest. In the early 1900s, the future Stalin made a name for himself as a socialist agitator, even escaping from Siberian prison before becoming an organizer of paramilitaries during the Russo-Japanese War. Somewhat infamous for his attacks on the Black Hundreds, as well as the use of bank robberies to secure funds for operations, he developed a reputation as an extremely militant member of the cause - for better or worse.\n\nPerhaps more difficult for the man was the field of party politics. For a time, Stalin had a close working relationship with Vladimir Lenin, which undoubtedly helped his ascent through the Georgian branch of the RSDRP. Despite that, he would find himself on Bogdanov's side in the split of the Bolsheviks, even becoming the editor of the party newspaper while in exile following the tsar's assassination. During the Great War, however, Stalin languished in Siberian prison once more, even being spared mobilization like his comrades due to a childhood arm injury. The outbreak of civil war allowed him to escape and link up with the party, and even take field command against the tsarist forces. Like so many contemporaries, however, he was forced on a long retreat into the Caucasus, where he was the highest-ranking Bolshevik remaining and a key party to the writing of the Kavkaz constitution.\n\nSeeing the benefits of maintaining communist influence in the army, Stalin followed a number of his comrades in staying in the army, despite his self-criticism for their defeats in the civil war. Now, following the ascent of Severyanin, the army has issued its veto with the sounding of guns. Premier Stalin now has the floor, and the excesses of futurism are being dispensed with. In its place will rise a clarification of the party line promulgated by Comrade Bogdanov, this time with feet firmly planted on the ground. The war against capital and reaction demands an organic, self-regulating party to see it through, and Stalin will be its cultivator."

Fortunately, the new Futurian government is not so hopelessly naive.\nThrough the study of history, one may begin to notice certain universal laws that govern the history of civilizations. As the East clashes with the West, as empires rise and fall, and as capital cities accumulate as dust on the standing waves, the laws of history reveal themselves. The writings of humanity on the laws of space have been piled up for millennia, done and redone so many times in a petulant bore that it would be completely objectionable for us to do any more work in this department. The laws of time remain pristine, enigmatic. Despite Khlebnikov's masterful calculations on the principles governing history, and the numbers behind them, we cannot help but feel that we haven't even scratched the surface.\nEven so, the foundational work that has been established is invaluable in securing our state's preeminence. Just as a train would collide with its brethren had it not a timetable of destinations, so too do the governments of space that surround us collide in tragic and pointless wars without the Tables of Destiny to guide them. Seeing the chaos in the world today, the importance of preempting history is obvious. Therefore, a laboratory of study for the science of time has been established as the new Supreme Soviet of Kavkaz.

This is the essence of the government of time, that beautiful ray which dismantles tyranny and throws on the light of liberty. Now that a government of time has been established, this doctrine can be applied to the maximum possible extent. Thus we proclaim this: an end to boorish behavior towards those who disagree with us. Any barbarian of character knows to respect his enemy just as he does his friend, so the Slav naturally tends towards the greatest freedom of expression. We will open the papers to publish without oversight immediately. As protests will be a thing unnecessary in a government of harmony, and ideological deviation a boon in a state of invention, laws restricting these activities become superfluous, and will be stricken from the books without a hitch.

Other, more impetuous individuals claim that the Futurian ideology is "literal nonsense", and have even gone so far as to term Chairman Khlebnikov a "madman". While these pithy phrases are at once ridiculous and boring, we cannot stand by and allow these ideas to remain uncorrected. So at once, let the whole truth be known: ASSU follows a specific and measurable doctrine, one formulated from perennial truths and forged in the furnace of science. It is the doctrine of Political Rayism. The state as a vector pushing through time. A war against ignorance and folly, a war for conscience. We are here to make the oriental carpet of names and governments dissolve into the ray of humanity. Let the whole universe be considered as a ray, and let us be at the tip."

A new alphabet will be devised, a universality which transcends all national boundaries to be understood by all mankind. S will be a fixed point from which many other points begin a trajectory. R will divide a smooth hollow body with the trace of the movement of another body through it. From these basic functions we will create phonemes, and from there, words.\nOur language will unite the third planet from the Sun, as each word spoken will contain the principle of its combined letters, and be understood by all. Each sentence will be its own laboratory of sound, a beyonsensical truth breaking its way out of the mind and into the starry sky, for all to hear. Conversation will be made a sublime science, writing an immutable calligraphy. The universe will only have us to thank for setting its vibrations onto the radiant path of pure essence."

In doing this, our government will declare itself connected but subordinate to this new society, composed of exactly 317 great men from across the globe. Inventors, explorers, poets, literati, and all who oppose the current exploitative model of human government will be invited to participate in this wondrous new apparatus. These men will coordinate and assist all nations, putting the world on track to harmony. In his charity, Khlebnikov has even invited F.T.

Although society has not yet advanced to the stage at which Zaum may be thought and spoken freely, thereby bypassing the restrictive vessel of the mind, we may nonetheless engage in a sort of Zaum throughout day-to-day life.\n\nNo respectable citizen of ASSU will be seen walking the streets in one of those boring suits any longer! Instead, he might try a shirt in the new fashion, shaped in the manner of medieval armor. No one needs to settle down to live their days out in sorry want, clamoring for anything to fill their empty souls.

Paired of course, with the finest imported French wines. All from the comfort of Severyanin's personal residence nonetheless. Indeed, why stop there? Such extravagance should be a point of national pride, massive banquets for the men and women of the future. Those of class, with the position and posture to march onwards arm in arm with Igor Severyanin towards the Bright Tomorrow. Such guests require supreme treatment and with our recent successes diplomatically, we can provide it! Though some feckless economists have decried the "sheer burden of expenditure and complications" that funding our planned banquets, galas and festivals would require, we have brushed their cries aside. Truly, what loss is there to be had? No expense is too great for the sake of thriving futurist intelligentsia! Furthermore, we must move beyond mere material celebration, the aestheticization of our politics and cultural life shall be total! Politics begets art, art begets politics!\n\nThe wider masses, while certainly not to be invited wholesale, will still be able to and encouraged to celebrate in their own preferred manner.

In reality, it is the great unspoken truth of the futurist cause. The futurist is a hero, a triumphant Icarus daring to unmoor himself from the harbour of cloying tradition, stagnant culture and moral cowardice. Such individuals are fundamentally heroic in character, a cut above the complacent mass of lethargic sluggards that tragically comprise the majority of the human race. Our new Society seeks to foster such souls, the artist, poet, engineer, intellectual, soldier and other such noble pursuits. They deserve to be elevated, to be held up as the model of the modern man.\n\nThe blazing truth of our Ego-Futurism however, is that this divide between elite and plebeian is not some archaic condemnation born of bloodline, caste or class. By the example provided by the futurist intelligentsia, the road to Parnassus is revealed! The sheep shall follow their shepherds!  The ideal mode of being is confirmed! There is no beauty except in the struggle. No masterpiece void of the stamp of aggression. Our Poetry shall be a violent assault against unknown forces, the brave few laying them low at the feet of man. The motto of our society shall be courage, audacity and revolt! The universities, academies, military schools shall all be reorganised along these lines, to provide the elites the tomorrow requires."

The Ego of modernity is the roaring engine that generates the speed needed for man to snap the rusted shackles of tradition. Yet Igor Severyanin offers what some might describe as a remarkably moderate cultural program in comparison to the furious literary and cultural iconoclasm typical of prominent Futurists both East and West, the likes of Artaud and Mayakovsky. Indeed, the man has on many occasions been outspoken in his praise of writers such as Oscar Wilde and even Dostoyevsky to name but two. Severyanin oft wondered what such men would write if allowed to create in a wild jungle as opposed to a mundane and fenced proverbial garden. From as early as 1909, he had written of a coming transformation of Poetry and the arts at large in order to survive the modern era. Transformation being the key word, not annihilation.\n\nThis nuanced line of thought forms the capstone upon which this new Kavkaz is to answer the question of its literary and artistic heritage. The walls of tradition and fences of rusted morals erected around the soul of the Russian peoples are to be torn down and smashed into dust, but let the contents bloom forth rather than be uprooted! Let men interpret the old as they will and transform and create better and newer beauties! To the wind with the old morals and ways, let men plant what they will, where they will.

After all, is it not the destiny of man to redefine the values of society after purging it of distractions like religion? Is it not the purpose of our evolution as a race to overthrow reality itself? Of course it is! We ARE the revolution! We ARE the next step in humanity! WE, the PROLETARIAT, are the TRUE supermen, and our purpose is to liberate the masses from the illusion cast by the backwards bourgeoisie!"

Yet, it is not the end of our struggle! Russia cannot live in the filth left behind by its old rulers. The poison of tsars and bishops still runs through the country, seeping into its deepest corners. The chaos of the war left the people bleeding and scarred. Everything hinges closer to the endless void that we have summoned to devour the old world.\n\nWe cannot let ourselves fall into that void. We will not become mere anarchist wreckers – with steel discipline and the practice of will, we will raise palaces thousand times greater than the castles of the stars, temples higher and more glorious than any church of the dead God; so let the New Age begin! We will rush through the darkness like a train piercing the primaeval taiga, and we will carry the light to all corners of the world, proclaiming the death of the old civilization of flesh and stone and the birth of a new civilization of steel and lightning!"

From this pithy clay, with the sacred word of the Party, we will shape the Overman, the bold master of the new world. We will give him a new goal and a new morality, to transcend all others and conquer all. And through his labour, he will reshape all mankind to something else, greater, magnificent, terrifying – like a lightning bolt, like the blaze of atomic fire.

For the definition of ourselves is merely our extension unto the world. And the more we exert ourselves the more we become ourselves.\n\nWe shall hang on tight and enjoy the hysterical exhaustion of toiling in mines, in the foundries, in factories, in hell turning to heaven. Enjoyed the mad destruction of this rotting and disgusting natural order imposed on us. We shall decompose all that is non-productive. The peasant tradition, the family, cloistered village life, all mercilessly liquidated.

And a hero we will provide! A hero in the image of comrade Stalin and the prophesied overman, for socialism doesn't come to laud the people's needs and idleness; it comes to forge greatness out of them! \n\nThe Bolshevik creed will be now thus: one shall always exceed oneself, nothing is dearer than the cause of the liberation of mankind and nothing is impossible for the human will. With these words in heart, we will rejuvenate the Russian race, uproot its degenerate offshoots and create for the first time a people worthy of the title of humanity! Our ideal will be a creative hero – the shock worker who labours for the motherland's glory, the engineer and scientist who bring light out of the chaos of darkness, the artist, who is the engineer of the soul and the soldier beholden to bravely fight for the new world's dawn.\n\nIt's time to show the world what united socialist Russia can do. Our heroes will not be mere idols of a mad dictator's cult – we will show the world we can exceed the capitalist countries in everything. We will have the best athletes, the best scientists, the best writers, the best films, we will put a man in outer space and on the bottom of the ocean; there shall not be an area of human activity untouched by the mighty works of our people.

Human civilization has already developed enough to be able to modify the mind and body of man himself! Is it not our duty to use these marvellous tools to steer our Bolshevik lot towards the dream of Karl Marx? \n\nComrade Stalin is an example of the New Socialist Man - the Red Übermensch. Education at school should strive to produce a similar force in our youth so that future generations will be as tough as the Man of Steel! The new proletarian race of gods of the future will be able to build a new Tower of Babel that will surpass everything in this god-given world. We are the ones who will build palaces on the bones of the old world that Dostoevsky described in the pages of his books.\n\nThe construction of socialism is a slow process, and this must be treated with care. If we build a weak degenerate foundation then our revolution will collapse under its own weight. We must make the Revolution live in the veins of every Russian! We must make the Revolution eternally alive! Thanks to social engineering, we will turn backward Russia into a historic nation predestined to dominate other weaker nations that were unable to accept socialist grace! "

He has accomplished what Bogdanov and Lenin could not. He made Russia powerful and a Red,  communist empire. \n\nThose who call our comrade a mere brute are blind! Iosif Stalin is a man of finesse, good taste, and Bolshevik greatness, which is embodied in our revolution. He is the avatar of Nebuchadnezzar II the Great. Our state is the reincarnation of his glorious empire. Nature has been subordinated to our revolution in order to be able to create a beauty comparable to one of the seven wonders of the world; the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis.\n\nBut we would have to be as small-minded as the Mensheviks or the Tsarists to think that what we are doing has an ending! There is no ending! There is only an eternal race to the ideal that is Bolshevism! We shall not rest until the antique greatness manifested in our leader has descended like manna from heaven upon all the people of Eurasia and the whole world! We bring you a new covenant, which will not be produced by the creation of the schizophrenia of a few old men in the desert, but by the Titans of the New Era! We declare war on what is small, old, ugly, decayed, and passionless! "

As he approached the doors of the Congress, he took a deep breath, and entered. \n\nUpon entering the first thing that hit him was the heat. Something about the energy of these men made a building in the middle of a city frozen in winter feel like the sun. The second thing that him was the sound.  \n\nHe could hear what seemed like a million disparate groups of men and women on the verge of brawling inside the assembly over who should be the next chairman. Hardliners swearing eternal fealty to Mayakovsky, upstarts carving Eurasia and Mirsky onto their heart, and anarchist radicals and other lunatics carrying Khlebnikov and his madness on their shoulders. \n\nHe couldn't imagine better company. \n\nAfter everyone settled down, and role was taken, voting began. \n\n \"Comrade Kipani, who do you cast your vote for?\""

kav.2.desc:0 "Mayakovsky stood behind the doorway. In front of it, thousands had gathered from across the country, some even from out of Kavkaz, no doubt, to hear his address to the nation and the Future Guards that had been announced earlier in the week. Civilians, revolutionaries, government officials, everyone had been waiting with anticipation to see what this declaration would hold in store for the revolution. It was time to deliver…\n\nAs he took a breath, he stepped outside the doorway and onto the podium. Around him were various officials sitting beneath a podium. The crimson banners of the revolution adorned with that beautiful lightning cross flew overhead proudly in the wind. Beneath him stood many thousands who erupted into a roar of applause and cheer as they saw him emerge.\n\nMayakovsky paused for a moment to wait for the cheer to die down, before he began to speak. "Comrades! It has been twenty years since the dazzling strength of our revolution shattered the shackles of the Tsar over the Caucasus. Who will deny that we have achieved much in this time? Who will deny that the towering glory of cities such as Baku and Tbilisi may match even the grand skyscrapers of Chicago and New York across the ocean? Who may challenge the fact that our grand federation is not among the pillars of radical revolution that will cleans the world from the rusty old bores of reaction!" Once more cheer and applause erupted among the audience and officials that flanked Mayakovsky.\n\nMayakovsky leaned into the microphone, "Be that as it may, it is clear that there is still much work to be done. From the North to the South, forces of reaction linger around. Those who seek to corrupt and defile the path of the revolution, and perhaps just as significantly, those who believe they support the revolution, but in their spirit, their character, need to be freed as well! The traditions of a thousand dead generations of the past still weigh heavy on us all. The norms and morality of the bourgeoisie and plutocrats whose glaring contradictions were unveiled with the massacre that was the Great War still remain in even the most revolutionary organisations and movements!" Pausing for a brief moment, Mayakovsky scoffed "Suffice to say! This is not something that can be allowed to continue. As it stands, the revolution is only half done! What we need now is a second revolution. One that will upend not the realm of production, not the plane of politics. But our spirits! A cultural revolution that will set the country ablaze!" Pointing to the night sky, Mayakovsky roared "See! Like the Great Bear of the stars, we shall cement our place there among the heavens as we cover the Earth in the second deluge and wash away the rot of the Feudal despots or bourgeois plutocrats."\n\nOnce more cheers spread across the crowd, from a distance Mayakovsky could even hear some songs once written when the revolution first began. "And who better to unleash this new revolution than the youth of the country! Let the Guards of the Future go out to the cities and villages! Let a new wave of fervour grasp our throats and souls. You! Youth of the world, bring forth a new spring into this corner of the globe. Set the hearts of the workers ablaze in a new reign of freedom!""

He had worked in a small Georgian town for the last two decades as a priest, and had distinguished himself from his peers by out maneuvering every anti-religious campaign. It might have won him denouncements from the Orthodox church, but at least he could keep this town holy in a nation of demons.\n\nHe went outside to find the source of the smoke. It was too late in the night for someone to be cooking something. He feared a forest fire of some sort; instead, he went outside and saw a bonfire with youths carelessly throwing icons into it.\n\n"Stop! What are you doing! Those are precious, please, you must stop immediately!"\n\nSergey raced to try to pull anything out of the fire, to salvage just one icon would be worth the burns; but before he could get to the hearth, a youth stopped him.\n\n"Go back to bed old man. Mayakovsky has sentenced God to death and there is nothing you can do about it."\n\n"Son, I have been nothing but loyal for the last two decades, I have supported the revolution at every step! Why do you think I was allowed to maintain this church?!"\n\n"It doesn't matter, the deal has changed. Now go inside or else."\n\n"No! I have suffered too much to lose it all to a bunch of thugs."\n\nSergey felt the mood shift in an instant, the boys' faces contorting into scowls. Their arms let go of him, dropping him to the dirt. Before he could think better of it he raced to rescue the icons, but as he grasped one or two, he felt a boot kick his back as laughter filled his ears.\n\n"You have not suffered enough, old man. Feel the flames lick your skin."\n\nSergey felt searing pain like nothing else he had ever experienced before. He repeatedly attempted to escape but whenever he reached the edge another boot would keep him in the inferno. After an excruciating and uncountable length of time, the pain subsided. His eyes saw demons and hell, but his spirit was beyond all this. As his soul left his flesh, all that was left of Sergey on this earth was ash."

kav.4.desc:0 "Tbilisi has been a different place since the Red Army retreated here, Yakob thinks. He had immigrated here shortly before the war started and therefore was privy to all the changes that had occurred since then. As somebody who's revolutionary spirit had been shattered with Lenin's fall, he watched in despair and then in cynical amusement as good Communists fell to the level of arguing with moustache twirling painters and poets. Now, however, with Mayakosvky and the triumph of his specific brand of Bolshevism, could they truly begin to reshape society, and Yakob didn't know whether he was in awe or in terror of the changes that were coming.\n\nJust down his street, a former library had been demolished for the building of a massive, bizarrely-shaped building that was going to be a school for training Communist "ideological proletarians." The building, rather than following any conventional or sane form of architecture, seemed to him like the drawings of a child brought to life.  Workers no longer shuffled from factory to home humbly but walked with a new vigorous confidence, secured in their roles constructing a paradise worthy of socialist supermen. Yakob wanted to sneer at this display of what he considered to be bourgeois experminatation, but he could no longer deny that this new regime was going to be successful. However it was going about it in the most bizarre way possible, at least in his opinion.\n\nAfter a couple minutes of walking, Yakob had arrived at the home of one of his friends, a rising star of a commander in the Red Army. He looked and squinted at the apartment building-just a couple weeks ago the walls surrounding it had been a dour grey, but now it was splashed in a screeching mural that depicted a Red Army soldier who smashed the head of a Tsarist with a hammer in one hand and executed a bourgeoise Duma member in another. While it was good socialist propaganda in theory, the art-style and colors must've leaked from the asshole of some pretentious fool in the city once known as Paris. Yakob rubbed his head and groaned. He was only in his thirties, but he was starting to get the feeling his grandfather had when he first read aloud to him a short piece of poetry.\n\nSuddenly, his friend came out. He invited him in for some tea, but told him they could not stay for long because later this evening, a squad of young 'party lads' were coming to blow up an old apartment to make way for a new pistol factory.\n\n'They're hosting a watch party for it, but I figure you're not into that kind of thing, unless you suddenly have changed your mind.'"

The quiet told a tale - forgetful of all the turmoil that came with the revolution, in mute mockery to the ferocious storms of futurist rhetoric - the white walls and the pleasant corners, so dear to all simple souls, are here to stay forever.\n\nBut this was only an illusion. History, the restless engine she is, was working at full speed. In the house of the Uchaev family, one of these damp and gray ruins built for downtrodden proletarians, Alyona Vladimirovna was again recanting all the things she needed for her new life. All her clothes? Packed. A reserve of dry bread and water? In the bag. The little book of revolutionary poetry printed on the cheapest paper she could afford? Carried close to her heart. A heart that was racing— both out of excitement and fear. She was still scared of the old man; what if he woke up? What if he came out, with the ghost of the old tyrant Tsar speaking through his vodka-stenching breath, sentencing young Alyona to the dull and degrading life the old order has prepared for women; to slave away in marriage to some idiot villager?\n\nShe did best to cast away these thoughts, and instead to think of the future that awaited her. She thought of the lights of the city, flickering like fireflies, calling to her like fae. She thought of the Guards of the Future she had met - those wonderfully free boys and girls, allowed to live the best of life. With these images of wonder Tiflis, a paradise so close, yet so far away, she slipped out of her prison, rushing to the agreed place of the meeting. As she ran, her imagination rose even higher; maybe she will get to meet Mayakovsky himself! She swooned over the genius of the revolution, the man who cast away the bourgeois and the reactionary out of Georgia; how brave he was, like a hero of ancient myth - and how handsome!\n\nMired in those dreams, she was blinded by lights of an oncoming automobile. The steel beast on which the Revolution itself rode was breaking the silence of Gagra with a mighty roar. It stopped before her, and from the driver's seat window there peaked a smiling face of a young man in a black cap decorated with a brass lightning-star symbol - her ticket to freedom."

While there was never any doubt of course, of the triumph of the revolution, the Herculean task of freeing the chains of Russia and the construction of a new people was one that took much time and quite a lot of effort indeed. While the celebrations across the country continued, he had to address the elephant in the room.\n\n"Comrades, constructors of the great revolution for the freedom of humanity! I know you all have no doubt of the significance of what we have achieved these past few weeks and months. From the Amur to the Neva, hundreds of millions look eagerly to the future with pride at the dawn of a new civilisation. A new culture and a new way of doing things."\n\nMayakovsky paused for a second, took a breath and continued.\n\n"But it is not all glamour in our new Republic! Perhaps you all remember the start of the great cultural revolution? Now, I do not mean to say that this revolution was a mistake. On the contrary! A revolution that is designed to do away with the old constrained ways of thinking and acting, is perhaps the greatest act we can take part in! However, it is no secret that there were many excesses in the revolution, attacks on innocents, lynchings of those only accused of being reactionary of not devout enough to the cause of revolution. Is this any way to act? Is the murder of those, who at the end of the day, are just as fervent supporters of the revolution as you and I or the creation of civil war really the end goal of our endeavour? Of course not! Revolutions do not only destroy. They build! We, the constructors of a new utopia must harken the start of a new era in the revolution. The Guards of the Future's goal has been largely completed. The stranglehold of the bourgeiose has been shattered, now is the time of construction. They shall take a new role. One to build a new civilisation, a period of rebuilding and constructing a new future for all! Let them go to the villages and virgin lands to build new centres of society and develop the backwaters that curse so many thousands!""

Who would've thought, however, that Astrakhan would turn out to be the eventual cradle from which light would spring up?\n\nAs he walked towards his destination, Nikolai silently reminisced on how exactly he got there. Born in a rather normal upper-class household in Moscow, his interests in science would initially have sent him away from his homeland, as the Empire seemed doomed to be a bastion of obscurantism. And yet, by a singular twist of fate, he had seen the light. Nikolai still wasn't an ideologue, after all, as this was no question of ideology: the heart of the matter was both philosophical and national, and he, nowhere near the idealised vision of a proletarian hero, had managed to find a spot among the vanguard of the Eurasian future.\n\nThe truth had become clear: what had doomed Russia, and Eurasia as a whole to obscurantism, was not the absence of bourgeois-liberal ideas, that fifth-columnists tried to frame as modernity; no, what the Land had missed for so long was electricity, the spark of life. Nikolai, however, could change that. He, and Simon, and Alexander, and thousands like him, were going to bring a sacred fire to the people, a fire as warm as it would prove liberating.\n\n"Ah, we were waiting for you!" A small man bellowed out as he walked briskly towards the group. "Come in, come in! We're going to get you something to drink, and we'll discuss the finer details of what we need to do."\n\nAnd at this very moment, the fire inside Nikolai burned brighter than ever before."

As Mirksy's truck came closer and closer, Sergey's disbelief was transfigured into ecstasy.\n\n"Is this Father Sergey Ivanovich?", the Chairman asked. Sergey noticed a humbleness in his voice, and while Sergey towered over most people, he noticed Mirsky was shorter than most men. Yet his humbleness in appearance and manners was underwritten by a gaiety of spirit which bubbled under every syllable.\n\n"Indeed it is, welcome to Tsalenjikha."\n\n"Before the formal apology and transfer begins, I really must say-", he choked up for a moment, "how sorry I am from the bottom of my heart that we did this to you and your church."\n\nSergey could already see cameras being rolled out. He knew this would be a spectacle and part of the campaign to reign in the new chairman. What he didn't expect was a heart-choked apology from the head of state himself.\n\n"It is alright Dmitry Petrovich, God works the world how he must.

Let us look towards a dazzling future instead."\n\nThis seemed to relight Mirsky's fire and for the next ten minutes while the journalists prepared, the crew prepared the icons and the camera's were set up, the men talked theology.\n\n"It must have been so hard to be condemned by your brethren in Moscow, it truly is a shame what this war has done", Mirsky told the priest with a sympathetic cadence.\n\n"While it has certainly provided difficulty, being disconnected from all the conflicts and dogmas at the top has certainly helped me in integrating into this town. In some ways, it's even more holy than before the revolution."\n\nMirsky beamed at that, and was about to respond before being told the camera's would be starting.

A King escaping his prison would immediately become the most wanted person in the country, and that just meant a life spent in hiding. Still, sometimes, like now, he considered that option. He wasn't in his prime, and every day working here wore him out more than 3 weeks outside would have.\n\nSuddenly, the bell rang, which, at this time of the day, meant it's time for dinner. Igor, along with all the other inmates, went to the cafeteria. Some even ran - must have been the new guys, not yet broken-in. He took the scraps, which the authority called "food" as if to provoke a laugh, and sat down next to someone he didn't recognise. Someone young. Igor's inmate spoke first.\n\n"Why are you here, anyway?"\n\n"Many things. Apparently the most important thing was 'breaking the unity of the Eurasian peoples'"\n\n"You too? Damn those Whites! Comrade Mayakovsky led us through these hard years, and what do we get? We get the counter-revolutionaries winning without a single shot! We've been stabbed in the back, I tell you!"\n\nIgor pondered for a while, whether or not to reply. He was sitting right next to the type of person that would have probably suffered the same fate if it was him that took charge instead. After a pause that was long enough to think, but not long enough to make the whole situation awkward, he replied.\n\n"I don't like Mirsky either. He worships the past to the point that apparently someone saw him with a Chi Rho. You know, that whole symbol of Christianity. I knew the man was trouble from his first public appearance."\n\nHis new Bolshevik "colleague" agreed. Igor tried his hardest to conceal his identity, lest he face the wrath of another of his political opponents, but it was bound to be revealed sooner or later - he just had to pray that the name "Lotaryov" was less recognizable than "Severyanin"\n\n"What's your name, comrade?" the Bolshevik asked after a couple of minutes of discussion.\n\n"Igor Vasilyevich Lotaryov. Yours?"\n\n"Nikita Ivanovich Volkov." Igor almost let out a sigh of relief. He was spared the Bolshevik wrath.\n\nThroughout the entire conversation, he noticed both of them haven't actually touched the miniscule rations. He figured it's time to finally do it.

In the end, he ran out of aces up his sleeve and brought himself to the brink of nerves."\n\nBeria punctuated his platitude by placing a card on the table. Stalin responded with an honest frown on his face before puffing on his pipe. He tossed a card onto the table as well, a motion of regret.\n\n"What about this whole... King of Time situation?"\n\nHe snapped his fingers trying to recall the details, lost in a cloud. Beria, however, bailed him out, a quick zip to shut up the noise.\n\n"You mean Khlebnikov? What a jackass. I always thought of him as a freak. What luck he gave up politics after a loyal 'friend' advised him that he'd better back off."\n\nStalin chortled heartily, his pipe falling onto the floor. With a quick motion, he picked it back up, dusting it off and gesturing for a lighter as he corrected himself in his chair with a grunt.\n\n"What about the bourgeois rat?"\n\nBeria shrugged his shoulders.\n\n"He's sunk into the ground. I don't know what the men have done to his body, and to be honest,  I don't give a damn. He drew his 10 of Spades and pushed his luck. Not a soul in Kavkaz will mourn him."\n\nStalin blinked at him while blowing out another pipe smoke.\n\n"Well look at you, Lavrentiy Pavlovich. I didn't know you knew the meaning of cards! You must have really studied this game. I hate to divert it with politics, but on the topic of former comrades: what about his majesty, Mirsky the first? I'm sure that a careerist like him has already found a new job... a prince under Tsar, a professor under Capitalism, and a politician under Socialism!"\n\nStalin spat on the ground, his cards held hard in his hand. Beria smiled, his brain whirring as he recalled just what job Mirsky had been granted in the aftermath of the coup.\n\n"I don't mind small talk about politics. Our lovely prince has been crowned queen of the Eurasianology department at the University in Tiflis. Utter nonsense, but he poses no threat. His majesty is locked in a castle, yet has swallowed the key wholeheartedly."\n\nStalin finally threw the last card into the pile and raised his hands triumphantly.\n\n"Ha! The king himself. The only one left on the battlefield."\n\nHe laughed ruddily. Beria, amused, joined his comrade with a light chuckle. After all, Stalin - with the help of a few tricks - had become the undisputed king of more than just this game, and even a man such as Beria had to admit he was impressed by the cleverness of Man of Steel. As the two stood to grab drinks and wash down the taste of victory, Beria wrapped his arm around Stalin's shoulders with a twinkle in his eye.\n\n"You played them off brilliantly, Iosif.""

Maybe he wasn't fit to manage people, he thought. Maybe he needs to learn via trial and error. Approaching a bulletin board situated on one of the corners, something caught his attention.\n\n"GROUP READING OF TECHNOCRACY INC. MATERIALS IN BAKU"\n\nA group reading… He's been to a few, and they weren't exactly terrific. Sure, they helped him practice reading, but that's about it. But wait, what's that word? Technocracy? Andrei has never heard of that. It could mean a million things. Intrigued, he moved closer, and began reading, even if sloppily.\n\n"The Baku Soviet invites all managerial personnel for a group reading of newly-translated Technocracy Inc. materials in the city."\n\nManagerial personnel - that was him! A chance to improve! His eyes lit up and started scanning for a date to remember.\n\n"FIRST SESSION: [GetDate], 18:00, Factory 1"\n\nThat's in an hour! He knew where Factory 1 was, now it was a matter of getting there. Walking fast enough for a passerby to know he's in a hurry, but not running, mostly to conserve energy. Food could wait, this was an opportunity of a lifetime!\n\nWhen he arrived, he had ten minutes to spare, and he decided to use that time to find himself a good spot and rest. Finally, the time for group reading arrived. To say that Andrei was thrilled would be an understatement. He barely restrained himself from grinning, that's how excited he was.\n\n"Alright, we are going to read what our American comrades have written - all of it beautifully translated by our local Soviet members who happened to study abroad!" the group leader spoke.\n\nAt first, it really did seem useful, but fifteen pages into the provided text, and it's as if Andrei's body decided to smite him for the neglect he showed today. He couldn't understand anything. Sentences became word salads. What was "member of the managerial need understand tools worker" supposed to mean? Or "state provide material train worker manager"? Was it his eyes acting up? His lack of ability? Soon, other members of the group began to speak up, asking the leader to see if their copies are okay, because the text stopped making sense. Okay, he was not insane, maybe it's written in a hard-to-understand manner. When the group leader took a look at it, though, he said those are definitely errors in translation. Someone, somewhere, screwed up. The someone being the translators, the somewhere being Baku. As such, the session had to be rescheduled, while the translators get whipped into form and do their job properly.\n\nAnd so, Andrei left, and made his way home. Still hungry, but now also having wasted his time, even if the starting pages gave him some useful hints."

One stood at the door - the other began slowly walking towards the light.\n\n"I don't know anything, I don't know anything about selling state secrets to fucking Kolchak!" howled Severyanin unintelligibly, struggling to squeeze bits of sentences through his sore gums. He felt like he had spent ages in this surreal place beyond time. The Senior Commissar squinted his eyebrows.\n\n"Comrade Severyanin! You make me very uncomfortable.

Do you admit to selling intelligence to Petrograd reactionaries? Do you admit to collaboration with reactionary separatists in Ossetia and Aran?"\n\n"Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!

After all, he loved his job, and had little care for such things as life at home; the forges were the only family he needed. Sure, the pay increase was nice, but it was merely a bonus to his real joy of exerting his will on the physical world.\n\nAs he milled with the men before work began, Ismail's face began to twist into a scowl. They complained about Comrade Stalin's demands, they complained of work, they complained of family. They focused on their miniseries, their complaints, how they would be anywhere else but here; not their internal joy, the joy which would etch itself violently on the world, both in war and in production— one in the same.\n\nThe plant opened and Ismail got to work smelting iron. Each batch of iron ore and every chunk of coal he sent into the blast furnace was like a new child, the furnace his true wife. He was no longer a man of flesh; he was a father of iron, the holy substance of the new earth. For hours, the same process repeated, and with every new child born, Ismail moved faster, worked harder. Every allowance given to his flesh was a sin, every nerve needed to match the intensity of the machine.\n\nThen the world froze while he burned. The speed had made him sloppy, his greed casting Ismail into the blast furnace. His flesh, his sinful flesh, had allowed the process to be tainted and now it would be punished. The pain tore his mind to shreds, his muscles ruptured and burned, until all that was left of what was once Ismail was the vital energy which had fueled his production.\n\nAnd then, his eyes shot open. Ismail looked around, his eyes taking in the blinding light. He was home, truly home. He saw his nephews playing in the city square, and reached to hug them. But his arms would not move, his legs could not uproot themselves. Ismail tried to look down, but his head was stuck upright. Ismail, realizing what had happened, began to cry. His heart was overflowing with joy; he had been reunited with his family, his children. Ismail tried to let a tear out to express this joy, tried to burst into ecstatic worship, adoration towards Stalin for letting him be one with those he loved."

It was difficult to say, but the speculation alone had made him feel microscopic in comparison. Russians, Georgians, Armenians, Kazakhs, Jews, he was sure he heard a man talk in German down there. All gathered to heed the voice of a single man. Stalin stood an expanded podium built specifically for the occasion, the crossed lighting of Kavkaz now painting one side of the Red Square and the Hammer and Sickle of the Bolshevik party the other. A strange inscription was displayed in bold lettering everywhere, from posters announcing the occasion to plaques and banners: "THE VOZHD OF YOUR HEARTS".\n\nBut before he could ponder about what this strange string of text meant further, the titular Vozhd finally stepped onto the podium to speak. And speak he did, his words branding onto Ilyas consciousness like burning hot pieces of iron from the foundry. He spoke of workers, of Russia's past and future, of factories, of machinery, of the revolution, of what was and what will be. Ilya used to be sceptical of Stalin before, but now? His heart only knew hope and comfort, an unrelenting loyalty to a world being built before his eyes. Vozhd politically ended this segment of his speech with grace, waiting for the enthusiastic crowds to finish clapping before opening his mouth again.\n\n"And remember, workers, it is to you that we dedicate our very souls! I have succeeded as the Vozhd of Russia, but the task ahead is to become the Vozhd of your hearts as well!"\n\nThe crowd burst into tears, the ovation seemed to take forever. Stalin waved in the air, waiting for one of the party bureaucrats to check the sound of the microphone. A light tune started playing from one of the reproductors. The Vozhd grabbed the microphone and...began to sing? Soon the crowd was singing too, the party was singing, Ilya felt as if the birds had joined in their song as well. He could recognize The Postal Troika by Vadim Kozin even if its lyrics were not currently causing the earth to nearly shake. Stalin flashed a quick smile, dancing to the song's tune as a salve of claps and cheers echoed through the streets. The sound had grown louder and louder, Ilya frantically struggling to keep up with the choreography. He was invested, as were the dozen more people surrounding him, both young and old. Perhaps too invested, as he could barely pay attention to his eardrum bursting from the noise, blood dripping from his ear. He couldn't stop. It was impossible to stop. His aged body might have rustled in pain, but its needs came after the needs of Rodina. It wasn't long before it all weighed heavily on the old man. The body gave before the crowds, collapsing on the ground in exhaustion. Whatever remained of it was quickly turned into a mesh of blood and broken bones by thousands upon thousands of marching feet that had flocked all around him. Ilya died a content man, his last thoughts filled with the Vozhd that had conquered his heart."

How does the doctor want to accomplish this?"\n\n"Antonio Gramsci says: "A collective consciousness, which is to say a living organism, is formed only after the unification of the multiplicity through friction on the part of the individuals; nor can one say that 'silence' is not a multiplicity." We should in similar way strive to unite our society. But not just around race, gender, work, or other social constructs, but around our biology itself! The 'Hive-Mind'. Society should be organized like an anthill so that it can meet the needs of all proletarians. This can only be realized if we synchronize the brainwaves of all humanity; this is what we are working on now."\n\n"Brilliant! However... Don't you think, Doctor, that it's still risky? We can't make mankind into mindless and merciless robot. Humans must have some passion in them to create great works of art!"\n\n"Of course. We need not only a hierarchy, but also a leader. Because a collective without a head is just a dead carcass. Each leader should be eugenically selected to be able to lead a new race of gods.

It was said among many of our comrades that teaching theology in a progressive socialist university is a cruel joke towards socialism, that we are sliding into reaction. I assure you - no such a thing is happening!\" \n\n Murmurs began among the crowd, how is he going to explain it? \n\n \"The perspective from which we teach has nothing to do with the science taught in Tsarist academias. We will enforce no orthodoxy, and are welcoming towards new, revolutionary interpretations of faith. It was agreed in the foundations of our Federation, that a revolution in sciences is needed - and we have to make sure that the revolution extends to all sciences. We also stated, that, a deeper spiritual revolution has to come after the political revolution\" \n\n The murmurs slowly ceased into silence. \n\n \"This brings me to my second point - it was said that theology is an useless endeavour, an impractical science, thus having no place in this university. Nothing could be further from the truth! Theology is a most practical science. It is the architecture of the Second Revolution we are meant to begin. \n\n Let me demonstrate: Progressive theology says that our faith, Orthodoxy, is not mere monotheism but a certain synthesis between monotheism and pantheism. While God is a being on His own, he becomes through actualising Himself in the material world. This task of fulfilling God is beholden on us, mankind. All our technological and industrial effort, can mystically be conceived as a transfiguration of the flesh to bring it to the divine!\" \n\n Some shouts of protest came from the audience, yet Mirsky seemed to ignore them.

Some of our comrades deny that he exists. How foolish!" Sounds of approval, whistling, and clapping. "Yet we know better than them, don't we? We know God is everywhere. God is in the whip that cracks on the back of workers in Petrograd. God is in the poisoned tongues of landlords and parasites. God is the industrialist, the slavedriver, the general and the priest. The evidence of his crimes is universal and omnipresent!"\n\nSome specially ecstatic men had even fired off their guns in the air during the speech, as the hollers and screams of the crowd were so unbearably loud that one would believe an earthquake was about to swallow the old church. When the tribunal had calmed down, Mayakovsky began speaking again.\n\n"I would sentence the criminal, the tyrant, to death, so that the people of the world may know themselves as tyrannicides. However, it is obvious God knows how to come back from the dead, does he not?" Roaring approval and affirmation again. "In the name of mankind I sentence God to banishment! When the free people of the world has liberated itself from the yoke of slavery, when every inch of land is as godless as it has always been, when God has no chance of returning from the grave, then and only then will we turn our heads to him! God will be executed like a counter-revolutionary, a traitor to humanity!""

"How did it come to this, our great revolution…" mumbled the soldier as he stared upwards at the clouds, vision blurring from the plumes of smoke, flashes of light buzzing behind his eyes. It was supposed to have been quick, Chairman Mayakovsky's and Field Marshal Stalin's call to arms and protection of the proletarian revolution had been simple enough. True sons of the cause, the Red Army seizing the reigns of power from pernicious reaction. All in order to bring that Francophilia-ridden dog Severyanin to justice before a revolutionary tribunal for subversion.\n\n"On your fucking feet Lev, get up! Up you bastard! Back on that barrica-" the sergeant's voice was cut short by the splintering sound of glass shattering, paired with the roar of fuel igniting. The barked orders turned to a shrill scream of animalistic pain as the sergeant's back erupted into an orange-red blaze. Panic driving his wits back into him, Lev scrambled back further away from the hastily assembled street barricade. Several more petrol bombs flew overhead as if in a monstrous chorus with the first, dousing some other poor bastards trying to hold the line against the counter-revolutionaries seduced by that rotten poet. Groping for his rifle, he dragged himself to his feet just as the first of them began to make it over the top of the barricade. Racking the bolt, he sent a bullet straight through the head of a wild-eyed youth attempting to clamber his way down towards Lev and his comrades. The sound of an engine roaring cut through the din of combat, Lev turning to see an armoured car screeching to a halt and opening up with a storm of machine gun fire from its turret that erased the enemies that had tried to make it over the roadblock. He could scarcely believe it when Mayakovsky emerged from it, covered in dust, blood and sweat, with a half a dozen Future Guard at his back. "FORWARD!" he screamed, the words cutting away the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty that just so recently caused troops to falter in their mission. They turned back. They charged.\n\nGalvanised like never before, they surged forward like a hurricane up and then over the barricade, cutting and shooting a path through the counter-revolutionaries that now reeled at their resurgent charge. At the end of the street, the House of the Soviets of Caucasia, their prize, surrounded and fortified by the forces of reaction. They charged again. Not one of them stopped running, not even when the cannon-fire started…"

The man Kandinsky sent seemed seconds away from suffering a mental breakdown himself, some minor pen pusher in the ministry of economy. Initially a hopeful young man, the wrinkles on his face and bags forming around his eyes gave the impression of someone several decades older, who had just gone through two world wars back to back. Frantically tapping on an archaic typewriter, he places another paper on the gigantic pile decorating the room.\n\n"Alright comrade Chairman, we are done. And if I'm being honest... it's not looking very good." The accountant gulped loudly, a clear rush of nervosity overrunning him like he had just been electrocuted. Khlebnikov looked more frightened in comparison.\n\n"What do you mean it's not looking good? There's still so much to do! To unify Asia, to unify the globe... we are still months behind on many of our pro-"\n\nThe accountant cut him off before he could finish the sentence, grabbing a sheet from the desk and running his hands through the papers rapidly.\n\n"Yes, our projects certainly burned a spectacular mark in our economy. Lets see... renovation of and transport of a significant portion of the population to Astrakhan... movable glass mansions... space towers for uhh..." He adjusted his glasses to double take whatever he had read correctly "...the space towers for improvement of the living conditions of those socially stunted... Chairman, at this point we are two- no, three hundred and seventeen BILLION RUBLES in debt."\n\nThe chairman now looked like a child whose balloon got stolen by wind."O-of course. That will be enough, I'll see to it that comrade Kandinsky is notified immediately. You can now leave."\n\nThe accountant grabbed his coat and silently took off, leaving Khlebnikov to his thoughts. Three hundred and seventeen billion rubles. Three hundred and seventeen, 317, 317... eureka! How could he be so blind? The problem - and solution was right before his eyes. Why should the economy be restrained by something as stupid and barbaric as laws of monetary exchange? Why should there be wealthy and poor, merchants and traders? No, the heart's desire comes before that, as it always did. Value of services and labour would be decided in exchange for heartbeats, a new revolutionary economy that truly comes from the people. There will be no more poverty, no more thievery, nothing but the living and the dead. God, Velimir, you are a genius! It truly was a sign; a debt of that exact magic number should have been obvious. Khlebnikov rushed out of the room, hurrying to inform Kandinsky of this amazing discovery immediately. Following him was a swarm of smog, the dying gasp of thousands upon thousands of financial reports going up in flames. "

It gave him a little comfort to see the troops going through their mid-day parade drills. The Revolution had seen better days, even in their darkest days after their brutal retreat from Russia he had felt more confident. When Mayakovsky, he and the others had begun the revolutionary struggle in his homeland of Georgia, it was full of life, directed and uncompromising. Now, twenty years on he could feel the flame guttering, slowly gnawed away by the chilling touch of reactionaries both without and within. The latter concerned him far more, the White colossus in Petrograd was bad enough, but it boiled his blood to know that there were those who wished to "normalise" the revolution in Kavkaz. Traitors!\n\n"Damn the bloody Germans and their "normalisation"" he spat, talking to nobody in particular, alone as he was in his quarters. It was they that he blamed, that bastard Levi had infected the entire international movement with revisionism so far as he was concerned. Now, there were even those in Mayakovsky's own party who wished for "moderation", the sheer morbidity of the thought left Stalin cold with anger. The effects were plain to see, the upcoming election was proof enough of that. The first one in the history of Kavkaz where Mayakovsky actually faced any real opposition. It came with too many risks, and it had taken Vladimir himself to calm Stalin's anger when he'd been informed. True enough, another decent communist might win but what if one of those moderates got in or, perish the thought, that bloated poet Igor Severyanin? The moderates and other reprobates within Kavkaz seemed to flock to him like flies to a corpse. Some units within the army had even fallen under his influence, those that especially disliked their Field Marshal…\n\nSteps would have to be taken in case the worst happened, and he'd managed to get Vladimir to agree with him on this at the very least. Should the results go too far awry from what could be considered acceptable revolutionary fervour, the army would intervene for the sake of preserving the revolution. Only the most loyal and politically devout officers had been informed of this eventuality and not a word was to be said unless authorised by the Field Marshal himself, Kavkaz could not afford a civil war. Any coup attempt would have to be swift and efficient, machine-like in execution. Turning away from the window, Stalin sat back down into his armchair, retrieving his pipe from its resting place by his favourite ashtray. Placing it in its usual position in his mouth, he decided to try and calm his nerves by continuing his latest acquisition for his library, a new Russian translation of Shakespeare's Othello. Turning page after page, he found himself unable to relax from the frustration of it all. Grinding his teeth as if he were chewing gravel, his temper finally gave way:"

Tragically, he retained that same weasel-like voice and obnoxious tone, with which Igor had become overly acquainted with in the past weeks during these sit-downs. "With some assurances, perha-" the weasel tried to continue, pausing as Igor lazily raised a hand to shut him up for a moment.\n\n"I assure you" Igor replied pointedly, "I want what is best for our Society, comrade. Her Futurism, her Ego-Futurism requires far more than what the Bolshevik party line has provided for her so far", wordlessly noting that the weasel almost shrivelled in his seat upon hearing him using the word in a pejorative way, "You know it, and I know it. You would not be sitting there, merlot in hand and eye to eye with me if it were otherwise… comrade.", he finished passionately with a flourish, angling his own glass of wine with a shaft of sunlight coming in through the window of his personal study. He looked away from his guest for a moment, observing how the light refracted through it nonchalantly.\n\nHe took a few gulps, his guest flushing after drinking himself, stumbling over his own words as he attempted to continue listing his supposed concerns and grievances with Severyanin and his supporters. In truth, he wasn't entirely stupid to be somewhat wary, considering what the likes of Stalin and other communist hardliners had to say about the "King of Poets". Derogatory was too weak of an adjective to describe half the choice words hurled his way behind closed doors, if half of what he had heard was true. "Francophilic leech", "make-believe aristocrat", to name some of the tamer ones. He allowed himself a scowl. Jealous ingrates, all of them. He almost sighed into his glass, turning back to face his inebriated guest.\n\n"The coming election is our chance to secure our place in the sun alongside France and Fiume as a beacon of the future. The League Solar beckons us, if only we could free ourselves from marxist orthodoxy. Indeed, Futurism is beyond and alien to the dogma of Marx, and I am not ashamed to believe so, comrade. What we need first of all, is moderation, to slow down, that we might change course entirely. Limited economic liberalisation and relaxing cultural policy is just the beginning, I assure you. We have much to do, and I do mean WE, Petrov. Let our mutual friends know as well." he said with a smile, making a point of using the weasel's name as he gestured for him to get up. He didn't mean "WE" at all, but Petrov clearly thought he did. That was all that mattered. Once he was finally alone, he returned to his seat, day-dreaming of the speeches he'd give as he sifted through his notes and quaffed the rest of his drink."

Today was another day where the big man decided no labour was necessary of him, where he was finally truly free again. What better way for a man to spend such an occasion than with his friends?\n\nAnd all of the camaraderie was already there, waiting for him. Dmitry, Pyotr, fat Oleg, and Timur, the Tatar who barely spoke Russian and only ever referred to anyone as his "drog" in a butchering of Alexei's mother tongue. After Alexei passed out cigars smuggled from France, the gang sat in contemplation, unsure what to do. Simple muggings and drunken rampages just didn't cut it anymore, no. They needed something new, something with just the right amount of spice to get them on the proper track again. This contemplation drug on, until lazy Leo showed up. Alexei had recently introduced him to the gang, but there was certain suspicion around him that made everyone else uneasy. Word on the street was that he tortured stray cats which happened to wander into his flat. The wide grin on his face was almost infectious.\n\n"You suckers won't believe what ol' Mayakovsky boy just gave me."\n\nThe contents of his bag spilled out on the floor to the awe of the gang. Goodies. A shitton of them. A shiny skull badge with "Futurian Guard" engraved on it, a decorated knife... was that a real revolver? No way they could just carry that around, not without a slip from the Orkunk.\n\nThe surprise in his eyes must've shown, as Leo laughed and spat out a trademark barb. "What's the matter Alexei? Scared already? Aww, and here I thought you might join us..."\n\nAlexei's face was seething with anger. A well-placed punch knocked the upstart right to the floor, and just as quick followed a wrestling of the gun away from him. No shithead was gonna insult him today. The day he had grown up.\n\nThe man they picked up was no one special, some old teacher frequenting the old imperial library. Lot of folks were saying he was a spy for Moscow, and Leo didn't care enough to second guess. The alternative was much more fun, afterall. Besides, who else went to that decrepit shithole? No one who wasn't an old reactionary bore, surely. All it took was for him to step foot outside, and the fun began. Oleg tackled him straight through the door. Pyotr rearranged the library's shelves with his cane. Dmitry rearranged the man's face with his fists. Timur made a spectacular mess out of the records he couldn't even read. Any pleas for mercy were just gasoline thrown into their already grandiose frenzy. In the end, all that was left was the mangled horrorshow of a mutilated body. A body that was still breathing. Alexei aimed the revolver with a shaking grip, a ticket out of misery. First bullet, second, third, fourth, and on until there was no more. A conclusion and regret."

Jolly, did he know how to entertain his guests! Baku was filled to the brim with the finest cream of all countries of the globe, artists, politicians, scientists, and poets - all futurists! They talked and talked on hours on end about everything and nothing really, like everyone was their own exhibition of godly craftsmanship. Truly, if this is what Khlebnikov wishes to form the Earth's unified government, why wait? The waitress brought him another glass of wine, the arguments went on and on...He was locked in a minor show of wits with certain Fernand Léger, a representative minor enough for Le Soleil to send there. He seemed a little insulted to Gino, but overall the mood was great. Their argument seemed to go on forever, from techniques in cubist architecture to the ideological differences of Le Soleil and Fiume to even something as trivial and stupid as Albanian internal politics. He had certainly enjoyed arguing about topics he had no clue about or particular interest in, an endeavor his compatriot seemed to be equally overjoyed to participate in. That was until the arrival of the Chairman himself, when everything suddenly went quiet. Khlebnikov stepped onto the podium after a short melody was played, speaking with his shy yet musical voice, full of strange idiosyncrasies:\n\n"Comrades! The most important task has been placed before you! You, the prime representatives of the inventor class, are the brightest seeds of the Globe Earth, and as such you shall possess its most powerful duties as well! The Kavkaz Directory welcomes you all as workers for the first administrative district of a United Earth!"\n\nGino stood there, flabbergasted, with Léger beside him, mouth agape. Did this lunatic really just sign them up as officials for his government? Some rose from their seats in loud protest, or laughed nervously to themselves. Others, however, loudly cheered, exhilaration shining on their faces. Needing to find a place to set his eyes, Gino stared at J.B.S. Haldane, who was grinning like an idiot.\n\n"Friends, comrades, please calm yourselves! I understand your excitement, but such determination is wasted now, when it should be spent on the present festivities!" Khlebnikov continued. With this final outburst, the Chairman left the podium to confused applause.\n\nIt took Gino several seconds to regain his composure, before he shrugged to himself and walked away. He'd seen futurist playwrights shoot blank rounds at live audiences before; performances like this were nothing new. Regardless, the President's non-sequitur pronouncement had certainly enlivened the party's atmosphere. One conversation that was indeed quite enlivened, Gino and several other guests could not help but notice, was a heated debate that the newly crowned President of Earth was having with one Nikola Tesla.\n\n"Where are comrades Antonin Artaud of France and Yan Xishan of China? Why are strangers occupying their seats?", Khlebnikov came quite close to yelling, his face red with anger.  Tesla attempted to reply, before being cut off by Khlebnikov. He relented at once to allow him to continue, before finally deciding to cut Tesla off once more. "Nevertheless!" Khlebnikov proclaimed to no one in particular, bashing the table with his fist to punctuate it, "If the star of Kavkaz cannot shine brightly enough to be noticed by Le Soleil, then there is nowhere to go but over it!". "And if that bastard Marinetti doesn't reply to my letters again, I will challenge him to a duel!", Khlebnikov added as a post-script to his impromptu speech.\n\nAt this, Gino almost raised his fist towards the Chairman, but decided against making a scene, and once again cast his eyes to the floor in a miasma of confusion, giddiness, and irritation."

As usual on a Saturday evening, the local Mayakovskyite pranksters had pushed all of the tables together into a heaping conglomeration, at which they were free to begin with their rowdy poetry sessions and communist rabble-rousing. All of them were present on this day: Maxim, Konstantin, and the rest; scourges of the local gymnasium. Konstantin sat quietly at the table, pondering the monumental task that lay before them. How would they even go about making fun of the new regime? It certainly seemed content enough to make fun of itself.\n\n"The Futurian, [GetDate]!" Maxim broke the silence, standing on top of the table with both arms outstretched, the newspaper held at an arm's length. He continued reading it with his booming voice, which here could not help but add a grain or two of mockery into its normally serious air. "Since the visionary poet, and now our dear Chairman, Velimir Khlebnikov, has had time to sufficiently reorganize Kavkaz into a government in time, and reinvigorate our revolutionary principles, the Supreme Soviet has convened this very Friday to discuss the new laws that the science of Political Rayism has put onto the table. Here are just a few of the fascinating laws that the visionary scientists of our Soviet have enacted this week: The creation of a committee dedicated to studying the possible transformation of clay into meat!". At this, the entire cafe descended into riotous laughter. "Quiet everyone, quiet! Let me continue!", Maxim shouted above the rancour.\n\nAs he continued with listing the new edicts, each law seemed to provoke a more energetic response from the assembled group than the last, and even Maxim felt a hint of laughter creeping into his voice. By the end of it all, the entire table was bent over, giggling like children. Konstantin tugged at Maxim's arm, "Wait a minute, I think you've forgotten something. Look at the bottom of the article,". Maxim read this final passage out loud, weakly sat down at this point. "Many of these laws have been proposed originally by normal citizens just like you, the reader! If you have any visionary ideas to improve the lives of those within our state and within Asia as a whole, please contact the Government of ASSU at this number,". Maxim immediately felt invigorated once more, as a flurry of schemes passed through his mind. Without a second thought he ran over to the telephone, his friends in tow, and began frantically dialling. "Yes, hello. I have just received the most wonderful idea for a change to our civil code. Yes, I think that, uh, I believe that it would be splendid if um, youths such as ourselves were allowed to, from time to time, throw something through the windows of old hags who might yell at us. Provided that no one is hurt of course,". "That is indeed a very interesting idea. I see that you are in tune with the writings of our Chairman. Could you please state your name so that we might write you in as a potential candidate for the Soviet elections?", the representative at the other end calmly stated. Maxim grew uncharacteristically pale in the face and sputtered for a second. "M-Maxim Gladkov… that is my name,".

A good representation of Kavkaz, maybe, but he had much graver issues occupying his mind than a piss poor attempt at snark. His face was swollen and bruised, the tears barely leaving his eyes, clothes torn to shreds and drenched in blood to form a gruesome display of the mob's newfound creativity. And he was willing to endure everything. Well, before the politruk opened his mouth.\n\nSaba had learned many interesting facts about his life from the man in uniform, some of which the crowd was eager enough to write on a paper cap that they had forced him to mockingly wear. A westernised imperialist pig dog? But of course, he almost forgot. Petty Menshevik-Pogromist in cahoots with Moscow to destroy the Unity and Advancement of All Mankind? He had certainly never heard someone recite a sentence this long without interruption or stuttering before. Making a mockery of the principles of Political Rayism? Did that word even exist until a week ago? The politruk had forced him to repeat everything multiple times, prompting the crowd to flex their skills in throwing every time he messed up a particularly incomprehensible spiel of Marxese. It seldom mattered anymore. His face was already a striking shade of pink, and crying hurt more than the projectile book making its mark on his face.\n\nSoon the commotion died out, and he was left there alone, humiliated. The crowd had all evaporated, leaving him alone to his thoughts. Well, all except Eva. Of course she was here. Khlebnikov had made sure that everyone close to the sentenced was there to witness their torment. Friends, coworkers, family. All stood there. Some watched on with horror, others joined in with the crowd's fury, clearly high on the state's drivel. None had the courage to walk up to him directly, except her. God, it hurt letting her see him like this, more than the sticks and the stones or the laughter. What evil had he done to deserve this? All he wanted was to see Georgia freed, to give her a country where they could happily live as one.

Every citizen of Kavkaz remembers these words by heart, for they mark the way towards which all humanity will march, once the Chairman's sun shines upon all corners of Earth. Yet today it seems like a new frontier has been opened for those who tread the footsteps of Marx and Muhammed both. Can the immortal science of Political Rayism influence our comrades from amid the ranks of the fauna? The Political Committee of the minor Tatar city of Lenkoran has an answer to this much pondered question, and it seems to be yes. Following the capture of a particularly fine specimen of the Caspian Tiger, an animal present within Kavkaz only in that southernmost corner of the Aran SSR, one of the party representatives there had presented a most bold experiment in the field of political science: he had opted to recite quotations from the Chairman's writings to the animal, but a meagre sample of his honeyed words. What he discovered will shock you.\n\nNot only have our glorious leader's words moved the noble animal to near tears, he had done something which few mammals before him have - opened his mouth and spoke. The representative and tiger have argued for many days and nights, over many issues which had plagued Asia for so long. About the party's glorious direction, about what good Chairman Khlebnikov's reforms have brought to the peasantry. At the end (and there are many witnesses to this from within the party and workers both!) the tiger had relented to the learned man's wit, shedding a single tear before praising the good Political Rayism had done for both humanity and the animal kingdom, or if our stellar rule continues, soon to be a republic. Many leading minds within the country have already received this important discovery with universal acclaim, and the tiger had received both a reserved spot at the Tiflis Institute of Zoology and a special advisor seat on Inter-Species Matters so he can provide his wisdom to the Chairman himself."

Helmets and leggings covered in white and black and red and yellow arrows and crosses with massive protruding cardboard shirts.

Clothes that reveal to the world our victory over the Earth and forces of reaction.

It had already been a week since they were supposed to be sent on their way, and officials from Astrakhan had been hounding him to get the job done. It certainly didn't help that other bureaucrats in Astrakhan and Moscow had already followed Khlebnikov's orders to fund Futurist revolutionaries in China and India many months ago.  Narek's tardiness was starting to get on his nerves.\n\nAfter five more minutes of murmurs, nervous groans and re-reading and re-re-reading, there was a knock at the door. Without waiting for a reply, Narek Abovyan walked in. "And just where have you been!" yelled Zahit, wincing for a second from the light that came in from the corridor. "God knows how long I've been sitting here. Some of us are actually concerned with getting our work done, you know?"

If this wasn't a day for celebration, you'd have made me cry for saying such a thing! No… We're here to see what message you have cooked up for our friends in Persia. Unlike some of the drab bureaucrats in charge of support for the revolutionaries in China and India, we have courtesy! It'd be rude, after all, to just send a few guns and bullets and say, "That's it. Good luck and don't reply!"

The duty ahead of you is the greatest any man can hold. The time is fast coming that the vampiric rule of empire shall be vanquished by your hands.

kav.41.desc:0 "Khlebnikov was pacing around in his room. At any second, none other than Antonin Artaud himself would arrive in Astrakhan to meet with him. ASSU diplomats had told the French government that Khlebnikov had a proposal for Artuad that could completely shatter and change the course of world history! Khlebnikov knew this was no small moment for Asia, indeed the world! The future of a thousand future generations could very well count on this moment. The pressure made his throat as dry as a desert. But the very possibility of forging a new utopia filled him with just as much energy.\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity of waiting, there was a knock at the door. Antonin Artaud, the leader of the Avant-Garde State of France walked into the room. At once, Khlebnikov moved to shake his hand.\n\n"Comrade Artaud! What an honour it is to meet you at last! I hope the journey here wasn't too uncomfortable."\n\n"Not at all ,M. Khlebnikov. The honour is all mine. It is brilliant to see the success of another mind, another nation that has torn away the rust and rot of the old bastards!"\n\n"Indeed. Indeed. That is half the reason we wanted you to come here. The proposal that I had in mind is something that I am sure will pique your interest!" Khlebnikov said as he motioned for Artaud to sit down. "It is only a matter of time now, I'll give it a generation, until the tatters of the old world are cast into the abyss and the entire globe, all of humanity, awakens to something free of these detestable yokes of the rationalists and reactionaries." Artaud nodded along as Khlebnikov spoke, as he talked more and more of ideas of closer cooperation between their two governments. A part of Artaud grew excited at the possibility of securing such a major ally, until Khlebnikov said, "It is on this basis, the basis of a new destiny for man, that I would like to propose to you Comrade Artaud, a position in the coming new world government of the Order of 317. Asia shall be the domain of Asia, I'm sure you won't object to that! But I think for the French, for you, we can assign Europe, at least the vast majority of the continent. Certainly the Western half. Now, I know that the proposal of losing your national government may seem controversial, or perhaps even idiotic, but in times like this, when the world is on the knife's edge of revolution that shall be led by the Rayists, the unity of all of us inventors and explorers, us accelerationists, is just what we need! I'm sure that you of all people would understand the pettiness of nationality when the Futurian revolution is upon us!"The faint smile that was on Artaud's face faded away into a tired expression. It was all well and good to hear plans of support and cooperation, but by the second it was becoming clear to Artaud that Khlebnikov was little more than a child lost in the world of politics. He could appreciate his energy, and his dedication to what he believed was no doubt unwavering, but it would be a disaster to egg him on with whatever delusions he was babbling about. "Comrade Khlebnikov! '' said Artaud as he interrupted Khlebnikov right in the middle of his little rant, "I apologise for the interruption, but I have to say that, while I appreciate the energy and sentiment, I don't think this plan is particularly viable. I mean even if I wanted to join this Futurian world order, how do you think the Escadron or Augier's Greenshirts would react if I said the destiny of…" Artaud hesitated for a second, "France, is to be a province of Rus-", "You're misunderstanding, Comrade. This Government of Earth is beyond and above petty nationalist lines!" said Khlebnikov, "Names aside, I'm sure you'll find your worry is misplaced. This is the New World Order we're discussing, right here! I'm sure there are many people of yours who want in! I believe I saw one of your surrealists at my last conference… and won't the Futurists in the Escadron surely want to ally with fellow Futurists in the East? Obviously they're of a better mind than that pig Marinetti–" Artaud cut him off, "Comrade Khlebnikov! Please watch what you say! I don't think many people at home will take kindly to this plan of yours. I'm trying to build a revolution of the spirit here, I can't get lost in this silliness regarding bacteria soup! This government of time, a whole new language few people could understand, I apologise but it doesn't seem sensible at all."\n\n"Oh don't be such a bore, Comrade Artaud! I mean that with all the respect in the world of course, but come on! We can't be constrained by these notions of practicality and reason! Just look out the window, and you'd be hard pressed to deny what a glorious world we are making. Complete freedom of self-expression, new ways of thinking and of working! We are becoming the Gods of a Totality, don't you want to be part of that?"\n\nAt this, Artaud was stirred slightly. After all, wasn't he trying to revolt against reason as well? Nevertheless, he forced these thoughts out of his head. Khlebnikov seemed completely immovable on whatever topic he brought up, and possibly even delusional as well. Not sure of what to do, he thought only to change the subject."

Barely a few days after the chaos of the Bolshevik old guard's coup against the stupefying election of Igor Severyanin to the position of Chairman, the swift violence that almost rent Kavkaz asunder is being repaid in kind. The splintering of doors and the squeal of hinges mixes with shouts and cries of protest in the cold morning air, punctuated by the sharp crack of pistol fire.. \n\nIlia held on to the dashboard of the army truck as it screeched to a halt in front of the former Tiflis Marriot Hotel, putting one hand to his mouth to keep his cigarette tucked firmly in place as he inhaled deeply. Glancing briefly at the wing mirror, he couldn't help but smile upon seeing the thunderbolts of Mayakovsky and Stalin splattered over with yellow paint reflected on the side of their commandeered transport. Exhaling an acrid cloud of smoke and clearing his throat, he turned in his seat and blew sharply into a whistle around his neck and barked, "Get to work!" to the dozen or so soldiers waiting in the back of the truck. Ilia could still see odd splashes of the old colours here and there from where they'd dyed their old ORKnK patches and badges, furnished with hurriedly tied golden-yellow armbands of the same shade. The new symbol of loyalty.\n\nThey poured out of the truck like angered hornets, pistols and batons in hand as they battered down the half-barricaded double doors of the former hotel. There were even red banners still hanging from the upper windows, now ripped and riddled with bullet-holes. Some of Stalin's rats wounded in the fighting had allegedly holed up in the main suite once it had become clear that the coup was a failure. All that was left now was to clear up the refuse. Sure enough, there they were, filthy, fatigued and covered in bandages and makeshift splints. A few even had enough gall left to hoarsely shout some old revolutionary slogans as they hauled to their feet and dragged out the shattered doorway and loaded into the truck waiting outside.\n\nIlia cracked open the passenger door and stepped down onto the street, turning on his heels to gaze up at the hotel. She would have been beautiful once, back in 1913 when she'd first opened her doors. As a child, Ilia had always wanted to see what it would have been like, all the western food and clothing. The shine of champagne and chandelier. Perhaps one day he'd finally get a chance, if the Chairman's talk of economic liberalisation was true. Stubbing his cigarette, he allowed himself a grin as he saw the heads of his men bobbing in and out of view on the top floors, loosening the knots holding those ruined red banners barely in place. He couldn't help but laugh as one by one they fluttered down from their perches, landing squarely in the gutter."

Some of the esteemed guests at this most select of occasions, the brave officers responsible for clearing the capital of the Stalinist scum in the aftermath of that sordid affair."\n\nSuch aggrandising tales in the papers made Ilia Giorgadze hot under the collar. He entered the hotel lobby, almost embarrassed at the inflation of the small part he had played during that chaotic time. Nevertheless, it had afforded him a welcome opportunity. Those members of the military deemed essential to the defence of the Chairman and the will of the peoples of Kavkaz had earned not only membership of the Russian Futurist League but also invitations to an extravagant three day gala to be thrown in celebration of the new and explicitly "Ego-Futurist" direction that Kavkaz was to be directed in, as the embossed letter had stated in golden cursive. Some of his acquaintances had criticised his willingness to join such a group whilst being Georgian, but Ilia knew in his heart which way the wind was blowing.\n\nGiving his coat to the doorman and receiving a room key labelled "No. 41", he entered the main ballroom and was almost blinded by the sheer vulgarity of what he beheld. Ostentatious displays of towering champagne towers atop of every table. A more luxurious buffet of delicacies local and foreign adorned the rim of the ball room, which was packed to the brim with finely dressed gentlemen and ladies in all manner of dress, some gaudy, some aristocratic and some downright odd. On the main stage at the back, dancing girls from the width and breadth of Europe, Asia and beyond danced to music in manners he'd never seen before. Was that the ambassador from France over there? Ilia blinked twice, overwhelmed at the blizzard of colour. "A drink, sir?" asked a voice, smooth and heavily accented. Composing himself quickly, Ilia smoothed down the front of his second-hand dinner jacket as he turned around. He was greeted with the sight of a smartly dressed waiter offering a tray of some leaf-green liquor in crystal glasses that he'd never seen before in his life. "Oh, but of course" he replied, trying to sound as refined as he could as he took one. Raising the glass to his lips, he tipped his head back and-\n\nHe came to, in a drunken stupor, lounging on the veranda of room 41 on silken cushions clearly ripped from the now complete mess of the bedroom behind him. Head pounding like a parade drum, he took in the view around him. Fireworks and bright lights arcing through the night sky. Something stirred. He looked down, seeing one of the dancing girls sound asleep with her head on his lap. He blinked, before wordlessly reaching for a half spilt bottle of red wine on the coffee table next to him. "Long live the Chairman!" he gurgled, between gulps, as he faded into the liquid night."

kav.44.desc:0 "Mullanur stood at the centre of the assembly. Earlier this week it was a small concert hall for some school long since closed down. Around him there was much chatter and murmur, laughs and angry shouts. Most of the people gathered here today were members of the Guards of the Future, drawn by a desire to discuss what is to be the fate of the world. For the past five minutes he had tried to hush them up so he could begin to speak. But to no avail. With his frustration growing, he shouted "Since I cannot speak, let the floor be yours! Comrade Mauser!" and fired three shots into the air. Very quickly, the room was filled with silence.\n\n"Thank you, Comrade Mauser, for your wise words. You seem to have had quite an effect on the crowd! Now, if it is alright with you, I would like to take the floor once more." Mullanur paused, looking around for a second before saying "Comrades! No doubt you are all excited about the triumph of Comrade Mirsky and the start of a true Eurasian revolution! But of course, there is still much work to be done on this matter. Though we will surely succeed against the forces of reaction in the North, there is still the discussion of the fate of the Earth itself. We are gathered here today to come to a decision on what is to be done. So if I may, I shall start with my own proposition on what the fundamental character and goal of the Eurasianist revolution must be. Now, I don't think many people here will disagree, that for our dreams to be achieved we must spread the revolution through a grand conquest of the globe?" Cheers went up across the assembly in agreement with Mullanur's statement. He continued, "But it is not enough to say that we must conquer the Earth. What shall be the character of this revolt? What shall its fundamental goal be? The answer to me is simple. Much of the Earth lies chained by the imperialist parasites of the West. Across Africa and South-East Asia, these colonialist vampires drain and torture hundreds of millions of people every day for the sake of lining their own pockets! When the day comes that the sun will rise on a Eurasian world, every inch of Earth shall be free from colonialism! From the tundras of Alaska to the depths of Asia!"Applause filled the room for a time, until a voice came from the crowd.\n\n"If I may Comrade Mullanur?" It was Levan Nozadze, an acquaintance of Mullanur from the time he spent in Tbilisi.  "Your view is simply too naive! Now I do not disagree that the liberation of the world is a key goal of our revolution. But you seem to forget, the civilisations of Eurasia are simply those that are best fit to work for the liberation of Earth. We are, to the Cosmopolitans of Europe and the lost and confused nations of the South, a big brother! The guiding force of a new light in this world shall be that of the civilisations of Eurasia. Now I mean no disrespect to our friends elsewhere in the world, but it is high time that we recognise the fact that only the grand and ancient civilisations of Eurasia shall be able to move the world!"\n\nApplause from some parts of the guard rang out when others who seem to have clearly disagreed with Levan's analysis began to decry what he said. Some sided with Mullanur, some with Levan. Others didn't care and others were saying that both of their sentiments rang true. Mullanur rubbed his forehead and let out a groan."

kav.45.t:0 "The Necessity of Sacrifice"
kav.45.desc:0 "A heaving crowd gathered by the waves gently rolling onto shore at Kvariati beach, the jewel of Batumi's stunning coast. They were there to see the Chairman, in his first visit to their city since the chaos of the attempted coup weeks ago. Neatly lined across the beach and lapped at by the waves, several ships of varying sizes gently rocked to and fro in the bay, all repainted in gaudy and vivid tones of streaking colour. Most peculiarly, they were stacked high with dozens of pallets of bank notes and freshly minted bonds. No crew, just crates of currency strapped down with chains to the bereft decks of this maudlin armada. Overlooking it all from a podium erected just the day before, Igor Severyanin loomed large over the crowd, his back turned to them as he gazed out past the ships and out towards the horizon, his face a mask of crafted sombreness. The gathered crowded murmured and shuffled, guesses and speculation flying back and forth. Suddenly, Severyanin dramatically turned around to face his audience, the hushed whispers cuttting out in an instant.\n\n"Brothers and sisters, what a state we find ourselves in. Many of us refugees from home, sated for want of food and drink certainly but yet starved for that which is spiritual and mental. My compatriots, Russians terrible, what a state! It is your fault you see things narrowly, losing sight and hearing. Those of you native to Kavkaz as well, what else have we here but wheat bread and dreariness? Oppressed under the weight of our failings and those of our predecessors. We entertain ourselves with theatre, symphonies, shows and music, to distract from our sorrow but what art is this truly? Where is the sacrifice, the fire? We must aspire beyond the basic wants of breakfast, wood, and coat! With this act, by the burning of these floating monuments to our slovenly sojourn I want to inspire a spark within all of you!" Igor roared to the assembled crowd, moving between insult, inspiration and grand gesture. The crowd listened in rapt, baffled awe of this ostentatious display, almost oblivious to the paramilitary members of the Russian Futurist League advancing down onto the beach with bottles of petroleum and torches.\n\n"We must remake ourselves, reforge ourselves, smashing the chains that have held back this Society for far too long! May we be able to celebrate truly one day, giving majestic performances and dancing until the dawn!" Igor finished triumphantly with a great flourish of his arms as the last word left his lips, the signal to set ablaze the display silhouetted behind him in a crackling roar of oxygen-hungry flame. He cut an almost mythical figure standing there silhouetted against the purple-orange sky of dawn, jet-black smoke billowing from the roubles burning at his back."

kav.46.desc:0 ""Where do you suppose we're off to now?" asked Dominik. "Not sure, could be anywhere at this point…" replied Ivan as he huddled his field cloak around himself to keep warm from the wind chill. The truck made its way along the forest road, flanked either side by towering pines that almost blotted out the sky above as they loomed overhead. In the back, a dozen men of the Future Guard pondered what on earth they were doing all tucked into the back of a truck off into the middle of bloody nowhere. Chairman Mirsky's orders had come as an immense shock to most members of the Guard, used to years of ceaseless political and military action. The Great Patriotic War of Reunification had finally been won and many seemingly expected yet another grand purpose to labour towards. Instead, they were commanded to put down their rifles and pick up tools like ploughs, picks, sickles, axes and hammers instead. They had been dispersed across Eurasia far and wide, to every corner of the countryside and even the most barren hinterlands. "Mandatory enculturation" the order had been termed, but they all knew what it really meant. Work. Labour. Tying the urban and rural into one binding union. Easier said than done, but well worth the effort. Every industry was to receive the aid of the Guard in incorporating advancements in every possible field.\n\nOn and on they went down the winding road, coming to a stop amidst the front of a small logging camp nestled in the verdant heart of the seemingly endless Siberian pine forest that surrounded the settlement on all fronts. Shipments had already begun, several larger lorry trucks parked outside. One's engine roared to life, splattering the side of the Guard truck with flecks of mud as it squealed its way through the muddy tracks to deliver the small mountain of logs now tied to its back to wherever the Union needed them. "Inconsiderate pri-'' Dominik started, interrupted midway by their vehicle jolting to a halt in front of the Overseer's cabin. "Up! Out the truck!" barked the Commissar, securing his own cloak around his neck against the cold winds that silently rustled their way through the artificial clearing, being the first to hop down into the ankle-high mud.\n\nOne by one they leapt down from the back of the truck, lining up neatly for inspection. The camp overseer, a broad, muscled but short-sighted fellow, emerged from his cabin at last, adjusting his rounded spectacles as he squinted at the newcomers. "Future Guard, reporting for auxiliary duties in supporting the local industry." snapped the Commissar mechanically, betraying only the slightest hint of frustration with going from the forefront of the revolution to, what seemed to them at least, its rear. They weren't the first to think so either, judging by the grin on the Overseers' face as he bellowed:"We begin work at 9:00 sharp! Don't look so glum comrades, ..."

kav.47.desc:0 ""A momentous day for Eurasia, and all mankind", exclaimed Dr. Fridrikh Tsander as he gazed out onto the launch pad and its magnificent centrepiece. In truth, their facility was admittedly a modest affair to behold. A hurried assembly of temporary housing, concrete block bunkers and steel scaffolding that loomed large against the flat dry grasslands of the Eurasian Steppe. Its mission was far more grand in scope however, handsomely funded by the Central Committees recent investment in scientific advancement, particularly in the domain of rocketry and aerodynamics.\n\n In the midst of it all stood the most advanced rocket that Dr. Tsander had ever had the pleasure of working on. The Orel One, or O-1, stood almost stoically amidst the storm of activity in preparation for the launch. Engineers and mechanics scurried around its 14 metre tall frame, checking rivets and frame to ensure the rocket's integrity in a final rush before the coming launch. At the very top of the scaffolding holding the O-1 upright on the launchpad, several figures could be seen inspecting the precious payload now tightly secured within its pointed nose cone via small access ports. Dr Tsander squinted at the ant-like fellows tinkering away at his beloved from the bunker window, waiting keenly. Sure enough, one of them raised a green flag dangling from his waist and waved it frantically above his head. Fridikh beamed, everything was in working order. They'd had to cancel the launch due to technical faults half a dozen times now and he would've been having sharp words with the maintenance staff if he'd had to postpone for another week. Flipping open the safety cover of a button on the control panel before him, he let himself savour the weight of the occasion before almost slamming the button down due to excitement.\n\nThe shrill blare of the launch siren howled across the facility and out into the wider steppe, the attendant staff on the pad running for cover and turning back eagerly to watch the launch process. Dr. Tsander barked commands to his staff in the control room while trying not to sound too pleased with himself. T-minus 2 minutes. The rumble of the engines grew louder and louder. T-minus one minute. With a mechanical hiss, the scaffolding released its grip and shifted away from the shuddering frame. A slight wobble, a hundred gasps. It steadied itself, a hundred sighs of relief followed. T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 , 3, 2, 1. Liftoff!\n\nThe O-1 roared up into the sky triumphantly, to the chorus of frenzied applause and celebration below. Dr Tsander was crying with joy through his laughter. Upwards and upwards it soared, leaving a great white ribbon of vapour as it left the Baraba Rocketry Institute behind, shrinking more and more into a small dot to its observers on the ground. It began to arc as it climbed higher and higher, nearing the border of the troposphere and onwards towards its lofty apex in the stratosphere. Finally, far beyond the ability to easily observe and at a record-breaking height of 37 kilometres, its complex payload whirred into life to complete the objective of the launch. Barometers, ionometers, UV spectrometers, along with other atmospheric devices designed to take air samples at varying altitudes and more all whirred into life. Finally, as the propellant hurtling the massive contraption through the sky began to sputter and finally cut out, the most critical phase of the mission began. In an explosive finale to this historic event, the nose cone and its scientific cargo detached itself from the main body as the separation charges went off automatically. The rocket slowed and at last began to tumble back towards the earth like a great metal meteor, the nose cone falling in tandem before it's parachutes deployed and slowed its descent towards the ground. The measurements and data contained within were beyond invaluable, making the Heavens themselves ever closer to being united with the Earth. Slowly but surely,  it made its way back down to the ground like an angel from on high."

He was a learned man, with invaluable skills and knowledge. To no surprise, he came out of the revolutionary storm dry as desert sand, exchanging his old green uniform of a tsarist bureaucrat for the clean grey "work clothes of an intellectual worker" recommended by the new regime. In the end, he even won himself a spot as the director of hydraulic administration in Moscow.\n\nYet, Pyotr could not say with honesty that his life stayed on a steady course, untouched by the winds of great history. The revolution has penetrated everywhere, like a fever dream, nothing seemed to be spared comrade Stalin's magic touch. Moscow itself, the city he knew since his childhood years, became one giant construction site. Everywhere, new streets and new buildings were growing, not like the old huts and palaces that bowed low before their visitors, cowering like decrepit geriatic women supported by rotting canes. No, the new buildings were giants, giants of steel and concrete, monuments of pride and perfection. Despite their sleek modernism, somehow they reminded Pyotr of the Pyramids of pharaonic Egypt and the mighty temple-towers of the archaic Babylonians. Perhaps they resembled the great Babel itself the Scripture speaks of?\n\nThe trolley moved, a signal in the circuit board of the city itself. Around Pyotr, the world was opening anew just like every morning. On every corner something was happening, streets were filled with machines, with men, with labour; with the sounds of humming and knocking and the roar of engines, with the smell of engine fumes and of fresh paint. Somehow, he felt like in the middle of a furnace. Nothing ever stopped, everything moved, energy expanded and expanded to never cease, to swallow the sun itself, the whole Cosmos. And there was such discipline in the moves, such force that it became apparent to the old bureaucrat, the slothiest of beings: with such power, Russia shall conquer the world.\n\nThe Germans may have called themselves the communist vanguard of the world, but they could never tame the power of fire and steel, the lightning. What they created was merely a transfiguration of liberalism; a pitiful utopia of stateless harmony. If German socialism wishes to survive, it must adopt the Russian model, it must learn discipline and mobilization, do away with the sentimental pacifism and the chaos of democracy. Pyotr saw it clearly – in ten years, Germany will have its own second revolution, its own dictatorship. It may no longer be Communism as Marx prophesied it – but it is the only future.\n\nFinal station. Time to get out. The dream doesn't cease, the sickness doesn't go away.

Hundreds, maybe even thousands had gathered here for the past few weeks for the construction of a grand new city (the name of which was yet to be decided). Dozens of people, criss-crossing each other, all going to a different part of the soon-to-be city. Had he not been incharge he Andrey felt that he'd be overwhelmed at such a dizzying parade. The air was filled with the beeping of many trucks and the shouting and murmur of workers as they filled in the foundations of what would soon be a museum of labour. Andrey looked at his watch, the new volunteers were soon to be here.\n\nPushing past this labyrinth of flesh like a mouse rushing to the end of a maze to get its wheel of cheese, Andrey could see a pickup-truck coming in from a road to the West. When the truck came to a stop, a group of twelve or so men and women emerged, dressed in black. Some holding binoculars, he could see they were watching this parade for the birth of what would be a home for many thousands of people yet to be born. Their silhouettes cut through a grey sullen sky. To his tired eyes, they seemed almost like the phantoms and witches of old jeering and watching at the festivals of mortals.\n\n'Hello there comrades!' cried Andrey, as he pushed these thoughts aside. 'Hello there Comrade.' one of them replied. 'My name is Vitali Prokofiev. May we ask why we were told not to bring any guns or books? What is it that we are to do here?'\n\nAndrey replied, 'Guns? What need would you have for guns? What do you think you came here for?'\n\n'We weren't told. Only that we were to no longer.' Vitali paused for a moment,  'bring life to the villages in the occupied lands, shall we say. We've just been assigned to help here.'\n\n'The villages? So you're with the Guards of the Future?' said Andrey as he stood up straight. 'The very same!' yelled Vitali with a grin and a laugh. 'Well your job isn't to do whatever it is you think you are here to do. A new city is being built. You're here to help. Really I don't know why. We have quite a lot of comrades helping with its construction already.'

It had been a long day, and couldn't stop himself from looking at the clock to see how long was left until he could go home. But this class was his favourite. As always, his teacher Mr. Averin was speaking with a great passion indeed about the Great War and revolutions that captured Europe and the world. Anatoly was in awe of Mr. Averin's vivid descriptions of scenes from the Russian Revolution, and other upheavals that he had seen. He could see the sweat drip from his forehead and the spittle that came flying out as he talked of the Spartacists in Germany. How his clothes danced and shook with his rapid movements as he talked of the revolution in Fiume. Anatoly was convinced Mr. Averin could see the scenes of the revolutions as he roared.\n\nAfter a few more minutes, he settled down and said, 'Well class. Do we have any questions?' Immediately several hands shot up. Anatoly's was among them. Mr. Averin looked around before calmly saying, 'Yes, Anatoly?'\n\n'Well Sir, I just wanted to ask why is it that the revolutions in Germany and Hungary succeeded but the revolution here in Russia was defeated? Did we not have the support of the workers?'\n\n'An excellent question young man!' said Mr. Averin. 'The reason that the Germans succeeded where we could not is due in no small part to the fact that the German Spartacists were not plagued by division. On the contrary! It was their foes, those old decrepit fools in the Empire that were. Be it Hindenburg's clique who saw the uprising as yet another front for the war, or even republicans shocked by the prospect of revolution. The Germans were unified in their struggle against their foe. And that was our folly. We were not.' Averin paused for a second, as he walked to the chalkboard.\n\n'You see, while many tens of millions of people opposed the rule of the Tsar and his fellows, those that did were far too divided. There were the Kadets, Kerensky's progressive republicans, local peasant armies and Left and Right SRs. Groups who often spent more time fighting each other than the Tsar! Mind you it wasn't just the Non-Bolsheviks to blame. Even among the Bolshevik movement there was still division. It was that fool, Lenin, who sowed the seeds of division between the truly proletarian vision of the Vpered. So many were led astray from the ideas that promised to forge a new world into trappings of worker-peasant alliances and authoritarianism over the intellectual mind.'\n\nPulling down a map, he whacked his pointer on Turkestan and Eastern Europe. 'But perhaps the greatest nail in the coffin was the fools led astray by petty nationalism. Pilsudski and the Polish nationalists who, if we are being fair,  may have led a revolution in their own right, but greatly damaged our revolution by fighting the forces of progress and the Tsar at the same time. The Ukrainians and the Lithuanians did much the same. And who could forget? Enver Pasha, that puppet of the Ottomans who infiltrated Bukhara and Turkestan. Or Galiev's band of Turanists? Sure they may have led a revolution in their own right, but is it not clear that we could have secured a great future for the Russian revolution had they not let petty national divisions divide them?'\n\n'Thank you sir. I think I understand now.'\n\n'You're welcome, Anatoly. Inquisitive minds like yours are just what we will need in the future!'"

kav.51.desc:0 "'YES!', Vasily shouted at the clerk, who gave him a withering glance before writing his name on the sheet. 'Congratulations, comrade, on your enrollment in the New Human Architecture Program. Your unit is waiting out back right now, actually. I think you're one of the last to sign up.'\n\nGiddy with excitement, Vasily wrung his hands before following the crowd to the railway. There it was, and how magnificent it was indeed. Each railcar had on it a massive cube of glass, reinforced on each side with steel. Each cube was furnished with a sliding door, and a few basic ornaments and furniture which had been suction-cupped to the floor and walls. Vasily and the others waited with bated breath as the speaker walked up onto the podium. He was a small man, and would have appeared scrawny had it not been for the ridiculous outfit he was wearing, made up with stiff fabric in some absurd parody of the armor of medieval knights. Realizing that he was drifting off, Vasily diverted his attention back to the speech which the speaker had prepared.\n\n'... And that is why, my Asian Comrades, I am so excited to be here today. All of you are the first step in a new revolution of architecture, one which will eliminate the iniquities of landlords, the crowded slums of old, and the ridiculous nature of the old ways of living, forever! Indeed, all of you, I believe, are the final departure in the entire Union. So rejoice, friends, as this train departs to new places, where adventure will await for you all! Long live the Chairman! Long live ASSU!' The crowd cheered, confetti was thrown, a few jabs were made towards the speaker's choice of clothing, and Vasily finally departed for Vladivostok.\n\nAnd how wondrous the ride was as well! Vasily sat down at the provided desk and took all of the liberty he had to lean back in his chair. How freeing! All of the irritating bustle of the metro or the tough time he always had of the sleeper cars was nowhere to be found. Speaking of that, just as he finished his tea and rested his head on the desk for some shut-eye, he jolted awake as the train ground to a stop. A stout construction foreman hopped onto the train as Vasily wiped the sleep from his eyes and knocked on the door. 'Sir, would you like to step outside for a stretch or remain within your home before we load it onto the framework?' Standing erect behind the foreman was a massive steel skeleton that rose into the sky, dwarfing the other buildings behind it. A small menagerie of cubicle houses hung onto its metal branches, making the building appear like a tree that had lost almost all of its leaves. 'Where is everyone else? The pamphlet said that I would get a taste of the bustle of the city, you know, like those high-class aristocrats in St. Petersburg!', Vasily asked the foreman. The foreman chortled to himself and replied, 'Well, that's not my department. If you're been hearing anything from Astrakhan, it's probably budget cuts.' Vasily sighed and sat back down on his chair. 'I'll stay in here. Just load the damn thing and I'll ask about budget cuts afterwards.'"

kav.52.desc:0 "'Sold!', shouted the auctioneer, leering at his captive international audience. All throughout the hastily transformed hotel sat rows upon rows of the most esteemed businessmen of Europe. Kavkaz nouvelle bourgeoisie, French fashion designers, Italian industrialists, and even the occasional wary American or British oil tycoon all politely clapped for the sale of the Bakuneft oil company to the French.\n\nThe auction so far was, to put it lightly, a complete shitshow. When the Frenchmen and Fiumans walked in, everyone clapped and cheered. Some pause was given, however, when the Poles took their spots in the middle rows. When Standard Oil and Royal Dutch Shell entered one after another, the floor descended into complete pandemonium. It took a fusillade into the ceiling by the guards and an impassioned speech, laden with expletives, by Igor Severyanin about the insolence of those attending, in which he threatened to reserve the ball afterwards for the Americans, to calm the ruffians down. After all, the Russian Futurist League was freeing the market, and they couldn't afford to be too proud to beg.\n\nAs the afternoon wound down, and less and less prominent enterprises were sold to the international capitalists, the occasional shot could be heard ringing from outside. Probably some brave young man who wanted to die for the revolution. Igor Severyanin began to pack his suitcase and leave the dull affair when he sprung to his feet at some sort of commotion happening in the front row of chairs.\n\n'Get your filthy hands off of me, you imperialist pig!', the Kavkaz oil baron screeched, making the entire room turn towards him. He was wrestling on the ground with a Texaco executive, before they were pulled apart by a paramilitary officer. 'Gentlemen, what seems to be the problem here?', the officer asked. The executive scoffed and pointed at the Kavkazian. 'This clumsy buffoon tried to plant this silly notebook on me!' At this, the oil baron began gesticulating wildly and stammering exasperatedly, 'He said- the notebook right there says that he's going to- he says he's going to kidnap the chairman if his company doesn't get a big enough share!' The paramilitary officer looked quizzically back at the Texaco executive. 'That is a serious accusation. Is all of this true?', he asked. The executive responded by opening his checkbook and asking him to sign it. 'Why don't we discuss this over dinner?', the executive retorted. The officer agreed, and both of them returned to their seats."

kav.53.desc:0 "Ivan Ignatiev jumped at the footsteps behind him. He swung around slowly, waiting for death at the hands of some over-decorated firearm. A wave of relief washed over him as Severyanin's servant entered through the door with some sort of nonsense cocktail of tropical fruits.\n\n'I'm sure you're aware why you're here today, Sir Ignatiev' a self-satisfied voice projected towards his direction. Its owner sat on a plush sofa draped in all kinds of exotic animal fur; beside it was an opulent throne bristling with gemstones. A purposefully tasteless display of wealth, and Ignatiev knew it well. He cleared his throat as his mind swam with thoughts. Why had he even come here?  Severyanin would have him exiled from Russia at the very least. Most likely he would be killed on the spot. Ignatiev took a deep breath. These brooding thoughts wouldn't do him any good, and there was really no way to go but forwards from here.\n\nIgnatiev took five steps forward before stopping where he stood. He raised his hand with trepidation, then with firmness, and slapped Severyanin across the face. 'Of course I know why I'm here, you oaf! You killed the Futurist revolution single-handedly, and we all know it! I bet you think I wrote the manifesto at the behest of Malevich or one of those other imbeciles you keep around, and you're wrong. I am an Ego-Futurist, and I wrote it for me! You sit there on your throne all high and mighty, thinking that you're some kind of genius for doing what those Italians have been doing for the last thirty years. It's pathetic! You aren't even a Futurist! All that you are is an Ego-Severyaninist! You're killing Futurism! You're-' Ignatiev's voice trailed off, and he stood there boiling with fury at the Chairman, who seemed, of all things, to be bored.\n\nStill, Severyanin was sitting up now, petting a cat that was ostentatiously dyed red and purple, occasionally rubbing his bruised cheek. 'Are you all done now? Good. I enjoyed your childish display of rebellion, for what it was worth, but I'm also going to make it serve as a good lesson for you. As much as you would love being martyred for whatever it is you believe in, I am a good king, so I will show mercy to my lessers. I liked that designation by the way, what was it… Ego-Severyaninism? I might just have to make that your legacy. Frankly, I don't think that you're worth deporting, so I'll just save you the trouble of revoking  League membership for you and your friends and send you on your way.'\n\nIgnatiev tried to speak up before Severyanin waved him off. 'No arguments, please, or I'll make sure that Civic Protection finds you a good place to stay. Oh, and one more thing. I'm moving the capital to Moscow. I've heard that a better class of man tends to reside there.'\n\nIvan Ignatiev was tossed through the brass double doors onto the curb. He paced around for some time, plotting all kinds of revenge against that bastard pig Severyanin, until he heard something faint from five floors up that made him grin ear to ear."

kav.54.t:0 "Drunk on Freedom"
kav.54.desc:0 "There is chaos on the streets of Tiflis once more, but this time it is a carnival of joy and vigorous celebration. The fruits of the liberalisation and privatisation of Kavkaz's economy have borne fruit at last. New products from foreign markets of all stripes flood into streets, many of which are completely new to most of the bewildered population. This new boom of commerce has everyone in a frenzy, products flying off shelves almost as fast as they can be offloaded from the fleet of trucks pouring into the city. Brands and items previously banned on pain of imprisonment and worse, devices once deemed too 'frivolous' and 'bourgeois' for the common man, now available to any with the currency or means to pay for them. The floodgates of Capital have been opened, the radios preach. In the eyes of the Chairman, they blare in static-ridden unison, the torrent shall propel Russian Futurism ever farther down its glorious path to an iridescent tomorrow for those with the will to seize it…\n\n'Hurry up Vova! They'll be gone by the time we get there if we keep this snail's pace up.' barked his employer, Katerina, as she wheeled around in her newly imported satin evening dress. It was terribly improper to wear in public he had remarked quietly at the office, damn his loose tongue! That was how he'd found himself here, luggage boy for the afternoon now that the latest sales were beginning.'Whole city's gone mad…' he muttered under his breath, hoping the small mountain of boxes and bags in his hands would muffle his complaint. Last thing he wanted was another lecture on knowing his role. As they rounded the corner and found themselves at the entrance to the Meydan Bazaar, Vova found himself struggling to stay upright as other shopping-crazed pedestrians pushed and jostled their way past him and his precarious cargo. 'Don't you even think of letting that fall over' Katerina hissed over her shoulder as they finally managed to make it inside of the Bazaar. 'Yes ma'am' he mumbled wearily as his arms ached from the strain.\n\nIn the end he was forced to buy a trolley with his own money to haul everything around. Western wines, jewellery, shoes, clothes of every shade shape and size, several gaudy home appliances he'd never heard of in his life. The whole spectacle was outrageous, Vova grumbled to himself on the inside. Katerina might be able to afford it but she could damn well do it on her time, or at least pay him overtime for this instead of holding his livelihood hostage. Craning his head over the side of the ever-growing mountain of shopping he was now thankfully pushing rather than carrying, he stole a look at her. By now she was wearing a wide-brimmed hat, american-made sunglasses and frankly too many pearls around her neck. He nearly went green thinking about the cost of it all. All that spending had put a smile on her face at least. 'Come now Vova, we've got to get moving if I want to make it in time for my reservation!' she cooed over her shoulder."

kav.55.desc:0 "'God, will you please at least let me put some clothes on?!', came a voice from behind the steel door. 'Why are you doing this to me?!', the same voice called.\n\n'You know very well why you're here, and why we're doing this to you, Boris.' replied, in a scarily calm manner, Nikolai Razumikhin, the head of the Petrograd section of the Civic Protection Bureau. 'You just couldn't let your foolish ambitions go. Look at me, this is what loyalty gives you! You know, you could've been standing here, beside me, and some other fool would be in that cell.'\n\nIndeed, Nikolai was right. Had Boris been loyal to Severyanin's cause, he wouldn't be there. But Boris wasn't an opportunist, no, he joined the Bolsheviks not to line his pockets later on, although that would be a nice reward, but to liberate Russia from the ruin Kolchak left it in. When Severyanin took charge, he immediately waged his options. Zheltorossiya was too far away for him, and there wasn't any other place where he could feel safe. Out of all possible evils though, he figured Kolchak's was the least. If he just lived in hiding, maintained a low profile, and striked when the time was right, he could be Russia's savior. Now, it all came back to bite him.\n\n'You know, Boris, I'm bored. Get out of that cell, we're going to play.' He obliged. He knew it'd be just easier to accept whatever the crazed aristocrat had planned. Yet, for some reason, he couldn't resist asking why he's going through all of this. After all, he wasn't giving them any information, and come to think of it, Nikolai never asked for it, either.\n\n'Why? Why are you doing this to me? I haven't done anything!'\n\n'You haven't, but you were planning to. This is your punishment. I don't actually care about getting anything from you, I'm just bored with life, and this entertains me, at least for now. See, such is the reward for loyalty!' Nikolai kept hammering that whole 'loyalty' thing into Boris' head as if he was getting a mansion for every mention of it. If he really was, he'd have mansions all over Russia now.\n\nEventually, they got to the place where the newest idea of Razumikhin's was to materialize.\n\n'Ever heard of sensory deprivation? No? Doesn't matter, you'll be an expert in this field soon, due to your experience.'\n\nBefore them was a contraption, full of straps, and a blindfold. Boris didn't notice the speakers, but he'd notice them soon enough. With him strapped in and blindfolded, his mind was racing. What was that monster up to now? It's like he's a test subject for all those questions medical doctors asked, but couldn't find the answer to, due to the unethical nature of experiments. Eventually, the speakers flared up. And they were playing… noise?\n\nRazumikhin resorted to observing him from the adjacent room with a one-way window. Ten minutes passed without anything interesting, but then, suddenly, Boris started struggling and screaming at the top of his lungs. Nikolai didn't know it, but that combination made Boris hallucinate incredibly vividly. The irrational sentences Boris screamed… It's as if he was dying, yet without a single drop of blood shed. And as such, another idea of Nikolai's was successful in providing entertainment, even if it was just for him."

kav.56.desc:0 "In a sense, the moving of the capital had simplified choosing a venue. Sixteen blocks of Moscow had been reduced through incendiaries, chemicals thrown into the fires to turn them a brilliant rainbow through the night. That was only the beginning, as the temporary living arrangements crept up around the site like grapevines. Artists and artisans on a special assignment were given their pick of the quarters, while the great mass of humanity cleared, excavated, and otherwise prepared the canvas.\n\nThen at long last, it was ready. Did the day bear any special significance? No, thought Severyanin, but that was beside the point. Why should the new men of Russia wait for some arbitrary cause to live to the fullest?\n\nThe Temple of Everything was opened to the public with an overflight of planes trailing confetti and flower petals. Onion-domed towers of glass, gilt, and steel outlined his museum-gallery-artpiece, where every wing and corridor was stocked with the joys of existence. A concert hall where jazz, readings, and the classics would trade shifts, a banquet hall where Marinetti's cookbook met old delicacies the world over, the theatre - and oh, the visual arts! Rotating exhibits of painting, sculpture, and performance vied for slots next to works of Repin and Malevich. And centered in the gargantuan main lobby, in affectionate evocation of men haulong boats along the Volga, a depiction of a glimmering golden monarch, steel cable slung over his shoulder to drag a great steamship into a jeweled future.\n\nThis all was the symbol of his Mount Parnassus, wasn't it? Mundane labourers had worked in staggered shifts around the clock to realize a vision, one they would have decried as impossible without elite leadership - because they had never thought to dream it were possible. Through the wars and exiles and fusillades of criticism, he had shown Russia - the world - such things could be.\n\nHis contemplation was interrupted by applause from the assembled dignitaries of taste. The King of Poets saw his work and knew it was good. At long last, he had won the victory over himself. He was Igor Severyanin – a genius."
