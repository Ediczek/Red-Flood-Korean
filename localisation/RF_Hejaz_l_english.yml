ALJ_ambition_desc:0 "In 1924, Saudi armies stared down the gates of Hejaz, and Hussein bin Ali - King of Hejaz and Caliph in Medina - blinked. It was at this moment that his son, Abdullah, realized that the future was there for the taking— all he had to do was grasp it. Riding a tidal wave of British support, Abdullah surfed his way into power, relinquishing the title of Caliph in a Faustian exchange for an end to the conflict and a seat upon the throne, a stepping stone to an Arabia underneath his heel.\n\nYet this newfound power comes with its own costs: the kingdom's mismanagement combined with the major source of revenue being Hajj pilgrims led to a symbiotic banditry developing between his father and the brigands of Hejaz, with Abdullah's soldiers - regardless of his orders in either direction - extorting all who flock to the holy cities. Thus as the Iron Sharif rebuilds his demesne, he must take care not to buck the very horse he rides, or else he will be thrown into the sands of time, buried forever."
