#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_KEDING_DESC:0 "Yuan Keding is the son of the great Yuan Shikai, the man who almost managed to unify China after the first revolution. Keding was behind some of the pressure his father felt to claim the right of Emperor, but after things fell apart in the 20's he was reduced to tagging along with the Authoritarian Anhui Clique who remained loyal to his father's name. Now that the Clique has been pressed to desperate measures, his push to restore China to an Imperial rule is once more entertained."
POLITICS_DUAN_QIRUI_DESC:0 "President of the Clique, General of the exiles, Commander of Mongols and the icon of Chinese-dominance on the frontier. Duan Qirui was a close ally of the great Yuan Shikai, though they had their differences later on. Duan still carries the legacy of the Beiyang Government and the principles it stood for. His compatriots in Beijing did not feel the same however, and the Beiyang became dominated by the Shanxi and Zhili, casting both the Fengtian and Anhui out of power, and in Anhui's case, out of China-proper. Duan now seeks to correct this mistake and use the Japanese invasions as pretence to restore the power of Anhui, though he will likely perish before he can see it realised..."
POLITICS_WANG_YTIANG_DESC:0 "A nationalist though not so revolutionary statesman, a loyal Chinese patriot, Yitang is prepared to do what it necessary to keep China strong. His history with Anhui clique goes back to the days immediately after the failed leadership of Yuan Shikai. He has served faithfully as a civilian statesman in the years since the Northern Expedition. Yitang is prepared to do anything to keep the northern government strong, even if it means bringing the dominance of the Anhui clique to an end."
POLITICS_XU_SHUZHENG_DESC:0 "Even from an early age, Xu Shuzeng proved himself to be an intelligent man. Born with a scholar background, he was the youngest man to pass the Imperial Examinations. In the year of 1901, he sent a letter to Yuan Shikai, then in charge of patrolling Shandong, to get a post. It failed, but it caught the attention of one Duan Qirui, who appointed him secretary.  When Qirui was appointed Minister of War, he became the "Director of the Army", when Duan became Prime-Minister of the fledgling republic, Shuzeng became "secretary-general of the State Council". It was clear to everyone that Xu Shuzheng and Qirui were close, almost if as friends. After the Warlord Era had started and China was once again in chaos, Xu Shuzheng created the Henan Defense Force, and successfully invaded Mongolia. Little did he know that this action would save his Clique, for when the Anhui were defeated and destroyed, Mongolia would be the perfect place to retreat and regroup. And now, Qirui has passed away, and his protegé has naturally ascended to power. He might not be the oldest or most experienced in ruling, but if there is one person who will lead the Anhui Clique to victory, it is Xu Shuzheng."

Duan Qirui and his men had no choice but to accept in order to survive, but in the halls of his headquarters in Xilinhot, whispers of a return to power may be heard by attentive ears.

Now is a time of mourning, but his successors must now prepare to guide the Anfu forwards, carrying Duan's legacy with them. As tensions in Mongolia and China mount, the time may soon come for great deeds in the name of our fallen brother. In situations such as these it is as good a juncture as any to take inventory, to assess, and to plan. Anhui may yet be well served by the leadership of its army and generals, but uneasy voices are beginning to push for a strong show of republican faith and hold elections to bring Anhui back towards the favour of Beijing. The choice must be made, either way, Anhui will have to concede military rule eventually, but will it be sooner or later?"

anhui.3.d:0 "The status quo cannot last, the autocratic rule of the Clique, Mongolia and China, must end and the representation of the people be allowed to flourish. Our new parliament is made up not of revolutionaries like the in the South but by sensible statesmen and moderate politicians, out with the reactionaries and warlords, in with the new order."

anhui.4.t:0 "New Economic Policy for China"
anhui.4.d:0 "Our leadership in China cannot be wrought merely in blood and steel, coin and calculators have their place in statecraft and we must now decide on the best economic vision of China we will pursue. Will we reform the agriculture to free up labour for industry? Will we forego precautions and industrialise no matter the cost? Or will we take a combined approach and modernise the farms and invest in factories too?"

anhui.5.d:0 "The Fengtian clique are the current masters of the Beiyang Government, to bring Anhui back into the fold it is they we must petition. Contacts have been sparse and cold when they have occurred, there is little trust, but things have improved of late. The threats to the Republic from the East and the South are now far greater than the factionalism within. It is time we rejoined our forces and fought side by side for China's future."

We share increasing political and diplomatic interests, much as we did in the past. They have made their intentions to kick out the revolutionaries and foreign powers clear, all that remains is to allow them back, under watchful eyes of course. The boon in men and material will certainly not go amiss."

anhui.100.t:0 "Anhui Seeks an Accord"
anhui.100.d:0 "The Anhui Clique, currently stuck in Mongolia, seeks to secure both their position and our border by entering into a non-aggression treaty. While the offer may seem an inconsequential and obvious choice, the possibility of using Mongolia as a future more favourable route into Central Russia than Baikalia and Tunguska remains as a tempting alternative. The Anhui may not suspect it, but Russia may need to once again trample Chinese and Mongolian sovereignty to secure it's future. Should we accept their offer, that route may be closed to us, at least temporarily. But we would gain a valuable potential friend amongst a vast array of enemies."
anhui.100.a:0 "Yes, very well."
anhui.100.b:0 "No, this jeopardises our position."

anhui.101.t:0 "Zheltorossiya Accepts Accord"
anhui.101.d:0 "The Soviets of Zheltorossiya have accepted our offer of non-aggression. Thankfully, our Eastern flank is now safer than most, and that border now functions as a means of trafficking men and materials from Russia into Mongolia to aid our struggle."

anhui.102.t:0 "Zheltorossiya Rejects Accord"
anhui.102.d:0 "The Russian Republicans seem as foolhardy as many of our own so-called republicans. They have rejected our offer, citing security concerns in Baikalia, and banditry on our side of the border. It is a smoke screen, they want not to be seen taking sides in Chinese affairs, lest it come back to haunt them later."
