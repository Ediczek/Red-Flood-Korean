People across Helsinki and other major cities see posters and flyers of various parties talking smack of other parties and sections of the SKP, with the Leninists under Yrjö Sirola saying that the other factions are weak and will result in the death of the nascent Socialist Worker's Republic. Tokoi's section, they accuse the Leninists of being ruthless and totalitarian, resulting in opression of basic human freedoms. Lastly, Päiviö's Industrial Workers of the World's Finland chapter had been against both parties, claiming they are crypto-capitalists, and that only through Anarchy socialism can thrive. Generally, the Libertarians under Tokoi are the most likely to win by virtue of being the bulk of the political establishment, with Tokoi seen as a war hero, whilst Yrjö Sirola has large support bases under the older socialists, whilst Päiviö is a dark horse candidate, most likely having a chance to win from the agrarian sections of the country. There are rumors of scheming from the 헬싱키 참전자회, but they claim to be largely apolitical."

They continue for some time until a noise is heard from the end of the table.\nThey all know why they are at this meeting, a meeting that will decide the fate of the nation as a whole. Yrjö Sirola stands and begins a prepared speech he pulls out of his pocket: "Gentlemen, the matter of business for today is an issue that has long plagued our struggle in Finland, an issue common in movements similar to ours. This question is of course, 'How do we deal with the moderates." One high ranking member stands and offers the solution to exempt the more moderate wing from the purges, stating how they are at most misguided and can be swayed onto the correct path. Another member stands up, being a more reactionary figure than the last, and claims that a full purge of society is necessary, including the moderates. He enters into a long rant about how the moderates are irredeemable and cannot be rehabilitated into the correct form of thinking.\nYrjö sits silently, weighing each option against each other in his head.

Several ideas are offered, but none seem satisfactory to a majority of people in the room. Discussion slowly shifts to more pressing matters, but the question lingers in the mind of Yrjö.\nHe once again begins his speech, although a cough persists through it:\"Now that we have addressed previous matters, we must focus on current ones. When we begin the purges, it is of the utmost importance that we identify who should be spared from these actions. I am personally in support of only sparing party members, but if you would make your case as to why all workers should be protected from our plan.\" Another man stands, one of the lower ranking ones in the room. He begins his speech, stuttering due to his nervous behavior: \"If you don't mind me stating my opinion, which should be the opinion of all people in this room, which is that all workers should be protected. The average worker has done nothing to deserve the treatment this would give him, and it would make us no better than the bourgeoisie scum of our neighbors.

Oskari lists out the two possibilities for dealing with them. The first being to outright purge them, ousting them from office, while the second option is to incorporate them into the military.\nHe begins by explaining the first option, stating \"The Punakaarti are a very dangerous branch of our party, and it could be beneficial for a purge of their leadership to occur. They are radicals who could seek to overthrow the government and obscure our revolutionary goals.\"He then makes the case for a second option, beginning by taking out a second piece of paper, \"The Punakaarti are very experienced in military matters, and could be of use to us against encroachment from the Russian menace. They could be incorporated into the army to use their skills, however this would keep the leadership of the branch, and thus it'd be just as dangerous. However, if they are satisfied with the incorporation, they would pose little threat in the foreseeable future.\"A vote is called, with everyone who supports the first measure to stand, and everyone who supports the second measure to remain seated.

I cannot overstate the importance of your vote in this matter, so it is imperative you participate for the future of your country.\" After he finishes, the three main cases for the Constitution are presented.\n The first case is given by a young politician from Helsinki. He begins by coughing, adjusting his bowtie, and pulling out a sheet of paper from his pocket. \"Fellow assemblymen, I have come today to present the correct option for the Constitution of Finland, one of true democracy. If we are to follow in the footsteps of Marx himself, a true democracy is needed to transition over to true communism. This is exactly why the Russians failed; they couldn't fathom having a democratic system and thus fell apart from the inside. To avoid repeating such blunders, democracy is needed. Thank you.\" He then promptly rushes back to his seat.The second case is given by a veteran of the party. He grabs his reading glasses and begins: \"Assemblymen, democracy is not necessary for us to progress against the tide of capitalism and establish a Marxist state. The party is the guide to all of the workers of Finland, and thus should have sole control of the nation. As of now, the masses are unready to achieve true communism, so we must continue to guide them. If a democracy is established, we could never focus on it, as we'd have to compete with other parties. I thank you for your time.\"\nAn old Marxist from Vaasa stands up next, he is middle aged in a nice suit. He puts on a proper speaking voice and begins: \"Comrades, talk of democracy and the party has blinded us to the fact of true marxism, the councils. The councils should be the main governmental subdivision in a proper Marxist nation, as they are the ones who can properly deal with the workers. This is why, as an assembly, we must extend their privileges, to encompass further roles, such as organization of labor, collection of taxes, and dealing with political efforts in their territory. I humbly thank you for your time today.\" He then promptly returns to his seat.\nAfter all 3 cases are presented, the matter is put to a vote in the assembly."

Regardless, the people now expect certain policies, and it is our responsibility to educate people to the contrary.\n\nThe biggest issue is that we have no way of spreading the news efficiently, since all civilian radios have been seized for military use, and most of the printing presses in Finland were destroyed in raids on private media outlets. Our two most viable options are to simply have our soldiers hand-make their own pamphlets on the matter, which will be effective, but will take a lot of time, or we could simply make a speech in Helsinki and hope that word gets around.\n\nMake the pamphlets."

The people will always mourn for the men who fought and died for them in both civil wars, and so the new administration has decided to offer the people a dedicated place to do so.\n\nThe Visage of the Liberators monument, which is to be constructed just outside the Finnish Capitol building, will honor all the soldiers who participated in the Civil Wars, with a detached section of the monument dedicated to those enemy soldiers who were conscripted or otherwise manipulated into defending their oppressors. However, the grandiose statue depicting the Battle of Helsinki will be dedicated solely to the Finnish Red Army, including the Anarchist Volunteer Divisions.

The hatred in the Vanguardist's eyes was withering. Tokoi accepted his congratulations, but made a mental note to have guards posted outside his room, some men not affiliated with the Red Guards. Paivio gave a downcast nod in Tokoi's direction and hastily left.\n\nTokoi's own supporters were delighted, and the popping of champagne corks contrasted pleasantly with the Internationale playing over the phonograph. Shouts of, "Chairman Tokoi!" rang out throughout the room as his comrades, his old friends, toasted to his health.\n\nIt all ended with a bang.\n\nThe door slammed open, and the black uniformed men of the HVA filed into the room.

Marko and his comrades had pulled the wretched creature out from his home late last night for "crimes against the Finnish people". Beating him had gotten old, not to mention tiring, and so Aapo had the brilliant idea to force the mayor to hold up the pails of bricks for as long as he could. If the pails touched the ground, they would shoot him.\n\nIt was fun enough, and the soldiers placed bets to see how long he could go before his back inevitably gave out. Marko was betting on the three hour mark, which was soon approaching. "Please," muttered the man, "please just let me go, I haven't done any-"\n\n"Shut up, swine! Shut the fuck up!" shouted Marko jabbing the old man in the face with the muzzle of his rifle. The mayor stumbled, his wizened, white-bearded face scrunching up in pain. The pail clattered against the street. Three hours, thought Marko, perfect. A gunshot rang out, and the bricks scattered across the asphalt. Blood flowed into the cracks of the street as the old man gazed skywards, unblinking.\n\n"Cheater!" shouted another HVA man, jabbing Marko in the ribs, "I'm not paying out, you shoved him".

The smoke from the cigarette waved in the air like spectral snakes.\n\n"I can't do that," muttered Kauko, "can't open the armory without the captain's say so, you know that."

Järv hoped he was in a ditch somewhere.\n\nSirola, though, now that was a slippery, dangerous eel. No one in the HVA knew his whereabouts, the Vanguardist escaping Helsinki during the confused firefight that had killed Tokoi. Järv wished, though he knew it was against his anarchist principles, that the HVA had an intelligence department, as tracking that bastard down was best done sooner than later.\n\nJärv cleared the troubles from his mind and enjoyed the moment. The smell of smoke, the taste of his drink, the clear night sky, the crisp wind. It was, thought Järv, a good day to be a Finn."

APCs modified with trailer hitches carried sacks of plunder, the watchful turrets daring anyone foolish enough to try and take back their belongings. Everyone the bandits could catch was thoroughly searched, pockets turned out, mouths inspected for metal fillings, jewelry roughly snatched. On the third day of looting, a trio of HVA bandits had earned the moniker of "the Dentists" for their penchant for tearing gold-fillings from the mouths of those they terrorized.\n\nThe people either ran, surrendered entirely to the bandit horde, or died. A few tried to fight back, but resistance was swiftly crushed, their bodies decaying in the street. Finally, after five days, the bandits moved on, leaving a husk in their wake."

Virva did, in fact, vomit, letting out a stream of hot bile into the bucket that had been prepared for such an occasion. Katja, with a shaking hand, lit another cigarette. The stink of alcohol, booze, and smoke permeated the room. The chairs they both sat on were of the finest quality, made of satin and mahogany, the table of polished cedar. It was a shame the bandits would strip the house bare when they returned. That was why the pair had piled their luxuries, their cigarettes and alcohol, the most appealing of treasures to the HVA horde, on the table. Better to enjoy, or force them down, now rather than let them fall into the hands of the bandits.\n\nVirva wiped her mouth with her sleep, the bitter, sour taste of the vomit mixing unpleasantly with the tobacco. They could hear screams coming from outside, the sounds of gunshots popping like tiny little rumbles of thunder. There was a pounding on the door downstairs, a frantic, forceful, staccato drumming.\n\nThe two women shared a glance, a heartfelt gaze they held as long as they could. Finally, as the door gave way and feet began to pound up the stairs, Virva nodded, and Katja reached for the pistol."

Pekka had considered finding his old mechanic and forcing him at gunpoint to fix the vehicle, but the old man had already passed. All around him, the sounds of cursing men and the grinding of machinery could be heard. The HVA had transformed the factory grounds into a makeshift workshop, gathering their mechanical treasures together in an attempt to bring them back to working order. With guns, they had had the most success, but in Pekka's warband, it seemed that no one knew a thing about cars.\n\nA couple bandits worked at ammunition stands, slipping new bullets into refurbished casings. Several others riveted new armored plates onto their APCs, creating crude light tanks. Yet more worked with torches to strip away scrap metal from unused parts of the factory. It was chaotic, unreliable, and time-consuming, but the HVA had no bosses, no quotas, and no wages. It was, thought Pekka, an anarchist ideal."

The rage of the HVA has thrown Finland back into terrified subsistence living and smashed any semblance of civilization in this now god-forsaken part of Scandinavia. The people huddle in fear as fires rage unchecked, bandits take whatever they please, and millions slowly begin to starve.\n\nBut have the HVA not fulfilled the promise they made when they stormed into Helsinki that fateful day? Has not Anarchy been brought to Finland? The bosses and landlords moulder in mass graves, the bonds of capital are broken, and the Finns live in huddled communes, growing just enough to survive. Is this not good? One day, the Finns, ungrateful as they are for the intervention of the HVA, might realize that the bandit inferno is not a curse, but a blessing. For through agony and blood, Finland is now truly liberated from the industrialized horrors of authoritarianism. Finland has been destroyed, but only so that it might be rebuilt."

Never again shall landlords and tyrants set Finland's course, never again shall a Finn scrape and beg for his bread!\n\nThe first Finnish general election, which will determine the chairman of our proletarian republic, approaches. Will the people support Sirola, the die-hard Leninist? Or perhaps their hearts will be won by the Marxist, Tokoi? The third contender, Paivio, the anarchist, could win the hearts of Finland as well. Much hinges on this vote, the ballot box playing steersman of the future of this new, red Finland."

FIR_sirola_secures_chairmanship_desc:0 "The Finnish people have spoken! Yrjö Sirola, a proponent of purging the remnants of White influence in Finland and instating a true dictatorship of the proletariat, has won the chairmanship. Closeted reactionaries hastily pack their bags and make for the border while diehard communists rejoice. A red dawn rises over Finland, may the enemies of the proletariat quake in terror."

Today, we are fighting a battle no less desperate, and the rifles and revolutionary spirit of the Guards is needed as much as it was in those dark days.

FIR_aiming_the_sword_desc:0 "We have handed the Red Guards a blade, and Chairman Sirola finds himself presented with a great many necks at which to swing. Rightist and reactionary sentiment did not disappear overnight, and neither did the other subversive parties within Finland. Even our own party is not immune to counter-revolutionary thought.

Our brave Red Guards, the vanguard of our revolution, must stand strong against any and all threats to socialism. However, a shield is only so wide, and the chairman must position his shield carefully to protect those who need it most. Who deserves our protection the most? The humble worker, or the brave party members who have stood with us through thick and thin?"

Our industrious chairman has done away with the reactionary shackles of the past, and Sirola has promised to hand the Finnish people the means of their liberation.

As the successor of Lenin, it is the duty of Chairman Sirola to introduce the Leninist principle of democratic centralism into every hierarchy that exists currently within our worker's state.\n\nAll directing actors within the Party, from top to bottom, shall be elected.

The chairman, in his wisdom, has chosen to subjugate the industry of Finland to a central planning committee. Trusts will be broken, ill-gotten wealth redistributed to the workers, and the needs of the people shall dictate what products are produced. No more frivolous luxuries and bourgeois trinkets, no more wasteful indulgences. Finland shall have what Finland needs, not what it wants, for the poison of capitalist greed lingers still."

For too long have Finland's farmers been allowed to exploit the riches of the soil by denying their hungry brothers the fruits of the earth. No more, says Chairman Sirola, let the farms provide for all. Henceforth, the farms of Finland, from the largest to the smallest, will be organized into agricultural collectives. Food, just like money, will be redistributed to those who need it most."
FIR_mass_industrialization:0 "대규모 산업화"
FIR_mass_industrialization_desc:0 "Finland remains, tragically, something of a backwater. We are a mostly rural nation, with little in the way of an industrial base. This changes today.

There is no time for delays, no acceptable margin of error, let the steel behemoths rise, and let Finland roar to life in this new, red age!"

The fields hum with activity as thousands of Finnish farmers provide food for the nation. The factories howl and rage as machines are turned out for the benefit of the proletariat and the army. The counter revolution is dead, strangled in its cradle by the Red Guards.

FIR_governing_as_parent_and_children_desc:0 "The socialist state is a loving parent, and all of Finland are its children. Paternalism must be our watchword, tutelage our goal. Finland is young and brash, and though it has chosen Tokoi as chairman, children are also impressionable. A guiding hand from the state will help our beloved Finnish children stay on the proper path.\n\nThough they argue and perhaps even rebel, such is the natural state of children and their parents. As long as discipline is administered with love, the children will learn."

FIR_maintain_democratic_socialism_desc:0 "Democracy, as the past decades have shown us, is a tentative, fragile thing. Tokoi has promised a free, responsible government that cares for the people in its care, a government ruled by the people, for the people. We will open the polls, register the citizens to vote, crush Gerrymandering, and fulfill our promise to leash the government to the will of the people."

FIR_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "Our current constitution is, tragically, an abomination. Written by and for capitalists and landlords, and still tainted by our former union with Sweden, the Finnish constitution is in desperate need of reform.\n\nIndeed, Tokoi has plans to go further. Throwing out the old, reactionary constitution and drafting a new one based on Marxist and democratic-socialist principles will do much to bring the Finnish people into our new, red future."
FIR_electing_local_representatives:0 "Electing Local Representatives"
FIR_electing_local_representatives_desc:0 "Though the federal government administers the whole of Finland, it is the local governments that truly make the most impact on the lives of ordinary Finns. Socialism ought not to be about boardrooms and long-winded speeches in Helsinki, socialism ought to be about the right of the average man and woman to self-determination. Elections will henceforth be held to elect local representatives to speak for the needs of their communities in the capital. Let the voice of the people be heard, unburdened by a cumbersome federal system!"

FIR_decentralize_economic_planning_desc:0 "Finland faces two demons. The first is the familiar monster of capitalism, already withering away under the rays of our red sun. As capitalism wanes, the other demon, the far more insidious state socialism, waxes and grows fat. Tokoi knows this monster for what it is, an authoritarian nightmare imposed upon the people of Finland.\n\nAway with capitalism, away with state socialism, and let a third option shine through the gathering storm clouds. Let us decentralize the economy, relax quotas and other authoritarian measures. Take the factories and businesses from the capitalist class and place it firmly in the hands of the Finnish worker."
FIR_workplace_democracy:0 "Workplace Democracy"
FIR_workplace_democracy_desc:0 "A boss has his choice of worker, but the worker has no choice in his boss. Bosses often become as such from the exploitation of their fellow workers, climbing atop them to become the masters of their comrades. To this, Tokoi has declared no more! Following the anarchist principle of workplace democracy, the workers will vote to determine their boss and deliberate any major business decision, with every worker eligible to cast a ballot. In effect, every business shall become one big union, with the workers controlling the shop."
FIR_means_of_production_seized:0 "Means of Production: Seized"
FIR_means_of_production_seized_desc:0 "At long last, the labor of the Finnish people now rightfully belongs to them. No more bosses loom overhead, no more landlords, and no more wage slavery. The workers are now truly free, the sweat on their brow unowned by any capitalist. In every shop and factory, the workers elect their own bosses and own shares in their companies. No longer will Finns scrape and beg for scraps from the tables of the capitalists. Now, the Finnish worker sits at the table as an equal.\n\nA hard fought battle indeed, but well worth the effort."
FIR_flame_of_socialism:0 "Flame of Socialism"
FIR_flame_of_socialism_desc:0 "Today, we have lit a flame in Finland that shall not soon be extinguished. The workers are free, the twin demons of state socialism and capitalism have been slain.

The forces of reaction marshall against us, seeking to douse our liberating flame in the muddy waters of the past. To hell with them! Prime the guns, sharpen the bayonets, and yoke the troikas, freedom is worth any price!"

FIR_transitional_government_desc:0 "We understand the irony of our situation, that an anarchist be forced to "rule" over Finland for a brief period as the old reactionary systems are broken down into kindling for our great blaze. We will keep our government as free as possible, limited only to aid for those in need, necessary infrastructure upkeep, and the supplying of the militias to combat the threats arrayed against us. We will assure the people this a temporary measure, and keep our hands out of the affairs of the communes as much as humanly possible."
FIR_social_contracts_over_constitutions:0 "Social Contracts over Constitutions"
FIR_social_contracts_over_constitutions_desc:0 "Binding documents are just that: binding. We won't chain ourselves to states and tyrants, so why should we leash ourselves to a piece of paper? We have no need of constitutions or any other legal drivel. The social contracts established between members of Finnish society are enough. As long as the freedom of one does not infringe upon the freedom of the other, then there shall be peace."

FIR_coordinating_union_and_commune_activities_desc:0 "A union is just a commune of workers, and a commune is just a union of members of a community. There are one and the same, and joining the two together (through encouragement, not force, naturally) will create truly self-sufficient communities. Just as the farmers in the commune produce grain to feed the workers, the workers will provide farming equipment to the farmer. Cyclical production between unions and communes will ensure a harmonious and prosperous society."

FIR_do_away_with_economic_plans_desc:0 "Economics, what a joke! This capitalist invention has made slaves of us all. Let us leave economic plans in the dustbin of history. A man does not need new cars, servants, or television sets, a man needs shelter, water, bread, and work. Our anarchist society will provide for the needs of all without the need to dirty ourselves with capitalist poison."

FIR_only_truly_free_market_desc:0 "The Americans will crow about the benefits of their so-called \"free market\", but the only example of such can be found here in Finland. We will fix no prices, levy no taxes, forbid nothing. The markets of Finland will be open to whoever can produce, to whoever is in need of what is being produced. Though we are still trapped in the currency system of the capitalist caste, we can dream of a day when goods are traded instead of bought, where favors and comradery buy more than money ever could."

A great flame blazes in Finland, a mighty beacon of hope to those still trapped under reactionary regimes. The people of the world will see that the dream of Makhno did not die in Ukraine, and as the first anarchist nation of any prominence, we must set an example for the rest of the world. We are living proof that anarchism is not a fail-state, not some unruly maddened mob of looters and vandals, but a harmonious and bountiful society.\n\nThere is still much work to be done, but one day, we hope that we can pass the flame of Anarchy to the downtrodden masses of the world."

So it is in Finland, as the HVA, a collection of disgruntled, vaguely anarchist bandits, have stormed into the capital shortly after Tokoi was proclaimed chairman, and declared a bizarre, anarchist junta.\n\nWhat hopes that Finland had for a peaceful transition of power have been dashed, and a new and strange freak of history has been born."

FIR_every_soldier_for_himself_desc:0 "Supply chains, chains of command, the Finnish army offered nothing but shackles. No longer! No HVA soldier is reliant upon officers to tell him where to go and who to kill, that is his own prerogative as a free man. Let them organize into bands if they wish, but this new Finland has no army, no general staff, just a horde of veteran warriors for the anarchist cause. String up the officers, loot the armories, and take whatever bullets you can stuff in your pockets!"

FIR_universal_military_suffrage_desc:0 "Though the notion of voting itself, pitting the majority and minority against one another, smacks of reactionary decadence, it is a necessary evil to maintain even a barely functioning state at this stage. All soldiers, both active duty and reserves, will henceforth be awarded the right to vote. Though this right is reserved to the soldiers, as only the warriors of anarchism understand our goals well enough to make well-informed decisions. When the "government" is made up of soldiers, why should civilians have a say?"

FIR_veterans_state_desc:0 "\"Anarchist Stratocracy\", that's what some American reporter called Finland. Not that we particularly care what the capitalists think of us, but it seems a fitting label. Anarchy has been brought to Finland at the point of a gun, the forces of reaction and authoritarianism lying in uncountable ditches, and our brave warriors have secured a state for us all.

FIR_take_what_we_need_desc:0 "Strip the luxury cars, loot the grocery stores and greenhouses, ransack the manors! Come one, comrade, chin up! Our sacks bulge with loot, and our bellies are warm with food wrenched from the hands of the rich. Houses are a bourgeois commodity, if a soldier needs shelter, he will take one. If a soldier needs food, then a rifle and a stern look will buy dinner. The Finnish people are goddamn lucky we've saved them from capitalists and reactionaries.\n\nAnarchism is, and should forever remain, a terrifying thing."

FIR_make_the_rest_ourselves_desc:0 "How hard can it be to make guns and cast bullets? The factories have been stripped clean, but some of the machines are still intact. Some soldiers know how to build their own firearms, and so it falls to them to produce weaponry for our mighty Black Army. What about food? If you're hungry, then grow your own! Want a car? Build one or take one from a civilian! Of course this is sustainable!"

There is great beauty in destruction, and as we watch the roaring inferno consume the nation of our birth, we can only laugh and think of the memories we made together. Freedom, true, unbridled freedom, has come to Scandinavia, to the world. The "anarchists" outside of the HVA protest and whine, the liberals cry and curse us as bandits. The reactionaries say nothing: skulls seldom have much to say. We don't care for what they have to say, we're free, and they're still slaves to the hierarchy."
