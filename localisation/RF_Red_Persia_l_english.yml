RPR_moderate_industrialisation:0 "온건한 산업화"
RPR_moderate_industrialisation_desc:0 "Persia is not only regressive socially and politically, but economically as well. What little industry we have was built primarily for the benefit of the British and exists solely to extract oil. Despite the need to rapidly industrialize, we simply don’t have the manpower or resources to permit a largescale industrialization effort. Therefore we must not only carefully pick which industries to develop in advance, but also ensure that we don’t get in over our heads with ridiculously optimistic goals."
RPR_nationalise_the_oil_industry:0 "석유산업 국유화"
RPR_nationalise_the_oil_industry_desc:0 "There’s a pretty obvious reason why Britain dominated us, and that’s because of all the oil we happen to have here.

RPR_way_of_the_jungle:0 "밀림의 방식"
RPR_way_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "The Jangal party has come a long way. The movement was launched in 1915, by Mirza Kulchak Khan, a partisan, agitating against the Qajar dynasty. In the years leading up to the civil war, the Jangal earned fame and influence, using widespread unrest to their advantage. After the 1st Session of the Worker’s Council, the Jangal rallied enough support, to take power and get rid of the Tudeh. Their rule secured means it’s time for a new era for Persia."
RPR_federalise_persia:0 "이란 연방화"
RPR_federalise_persia_desc:0 "All authority in Persia used to derive from the Shah, and like most despots he liked to run things from a palace in a conveniently located central position in the country. Now that we (the people) control everything, there is no longer such a need for centralization. To make the people feel like they truly have a say in the political process, we must delegate as much power down to them as we can and empower the regions. What we need, is a Federal Persia."
RPR_leadership_from_rasht:0 "Leadership From Rasht"
RPR_leadership_from_rasht_desc:0 "“유럽으로 향하는 관문''으로도 알려진 Rasht 시는 우리의 지도자, 밀림당의 아버지 Mirza Kulchak Khan의 출생지입니다. From now on, the new leadership of Persia will operate from Rasht, but sadly the city isn’t quite suitable for that in its current state. We’ll reshape Rasht into the shining pearl of Persia, to honor the Jangal and honor our leader."
RPR_state_before_people:0 "인민에 앞선 국가"
RPR_state_before_people_desc:0 "State before people… Many imperialists would use this motto against us, not knowing its true meaning. In the renewed Persia, the People thrive thanks to the State. The State is a vital part of every Persians life, just like God, just like Socialism. The imperialists and reactionary dogs who surround us may not understand, but they’ll soon realize the might of Persia. "
RPR_nationalists_socialists_persians:0 "민족주의, 사회주의, 페르시아인"
RPR_nationalists_socialists_persians_desc:0 "The Jangal party unites three distinct ideas: nationalism, socialism, and Islam, under one banner. Chasing the vision of our revolutionary leader, Mirza Kolchak Khan, we’ll synthesize these ideas to forge a brand new one, fit for the Persian nation and people! Long live the Jangal, the forerunners of Persian utopia!"
RPR_fuse_marx_and_islam:0 "마르크스와 이슬람의 혼합"
RPR_fuse_marx_and_islam_desc:0 "Many think that fusing Marxist thought with religion is impossible. But the Jangal has proved: Marxist and Islamic ideas of social control walk together hand in hand, guiding us into the socialist utopia. Only through the union of Marx and Allah can we end the class struggle, and put an end to social inequality. Allah and Marx, inseparable."
RPR_remove_absolutists_from_the_clergy:0 "절대주의 이맘 제거"
RPR_remove_absolutists_from_the_clergy_desc:0 "While the clergy are our nominal allies in revolution, it is apparent that the disease of absolutism has infected far too many of our clergymen. We should remove these parasites so that the revolutionary potential of the Islamic church can shine forth."
RPR_bring_the_bourgeois_to_constitutional_talks:0 "입헌 회담장으로 부르주아들을 끌어내며"
RPR_bring_the_bourgeois_to_constitutional_talks_desc:0 "The bourgeoisie may be our exploiters, but they are still Persians. We should allow the willing members of the ruling class to have their say in our constitution."
RPR_negotiate_land_reforms:0 "토지개혁 협상"
RPR_negotiate_land_reforms_desc:0 "Persia’s land belongs to those who work it. While it may be a long and arduous process, our government must begin the process of land reform in order to fulfill our duties to our farm laborers."
RPR_class_unity_national_struggle:0 "계급단결, 민족투쟁"
RPR_class_unity_national_struggle_desc:0 "Our people must realize that while class is important, there is currently an international struggle at hand. We must put aside our class differences in order to stand firmly against the imperialist bloc."
RPR_iran_reborn_from_agony:0 "비탄 속에서 다시 태어난 이란"
RPR_iran_reborn_from_agony_desc:0 "Like the immortal phoenix, our valiant nation has been reborn from the ashes of tradition and empire. No longer will our workers writhe in the agony of capitalism and reaction. Let us begin the work of revamping our infrastructure and giving our people the lives they deserve."
RPR_vision_of_the_states_of_tomorrow:0 "내일의 국가들의 전망"
RPR_vision_of_the_states_of_tomorrow_desc:0 "While today imperialism and capitalism rule the world, tomorrow it shall be the socialists who will rule. We should form an alliance of progressive states in order to make this dream a reality."
RPR_destiny_of_all_persians:0 "모든 페르시아인들의 숙명"
RPR_destiny_of_all_persians_desc:0 "Ours is not merely the destiny of socialists, our party, or those who pay tribute to us. Our destiny encompasses all Persians, and all Persians will have their lives improved by our state."
RPR_the_capital_of_the_middle_east:0 "중동의 수도"
RPR_the_capital_of_the_middle_east_desc:0 "As far as we are concerned, the Middle East begins with Persia. Therefore, Tehran should be remodeled in order to shine as an example to our neighbors, as well as showing the benefits of our ideology."
RPR_liberate_our_eastern_brothers:0 "Liberate Our Eastern Brothers"
RPR_liberate_our_eastern_brothers_desc:0 "With the revolution against the Shah secured, we must begin to look outwards towards the liberation of our brethren. An easy choice would be our eastern relatives in Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Dinia. They exist under the oppressive rule of Despots who only exist to curtail their freedom, an issue that we can resolve with our advances eastwards."
RPR_freedom_of_the_caucasians:0 "Freedom of the Caucasians"
RPR_freedom_of_the_caucasians_desc:0 "With our eastern brothers liberated, our next move must be towards the west. The Caucasus, once the playground of the Persians, Turks, and Russians, now exist in a state of disarray. This ranges from the sham democracy of the Armenians to the Azeri dogs who have troubled us so. The natural solution to this issue is to continue our march for the freedom of our neighbors against despotism."
RPR_equality_to_the_euphrates:0 "Equality to the Euphrates"
RPR_equality_to_the_euphrates_desc:0 "Our next target of liberation will be the two great rivers of the middle east, the Tigris and Euphrates. These ancient rivers, once the home of civilization in the region, have never known true freedom for its people with its string of Monarchies and Empires. Now we stand in the prime position to move for the liberation of the Arabs and Kurds of the region from their oppressors and bring them under our banner of equality."
RPR_more_equal_than_the_turks:0 "More Equal Than the Turks"
RPR_more_equal_than_the_turks_desc:0 "With our liberation of people across the middle east, only one major obstacle remains in our path. This obstacle, of course, is the Turks. The remnant of the once great Ottoman Empire, well known for its oppression of it's non-turkish population, now stands as a shell of its former self. We must continue to march westwards to end the threat that the Turks pose to us, and to avenge the people who have long suffered under their rule."
RPR_sunof_marx_eternally_shines:0 "영원히 비출 마르크스의 태양"
RPR_sunof_marx_eternally_shines_desc:0 "The revolution in Persia, once impossible, except in the distant thoughts of a small number of minor intellectuals and emigres, has finally been achieved. This has given us the ability to blossom into a beacon of Marx's true beliefs in the Middle East. We can continue to develop our nation and spread the visions of Marx across the middle east."
