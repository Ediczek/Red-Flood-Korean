##Collapse Events
##Manchu Leaves
HAR.11.t:0 "The Manchus Declare Independence!"
HAR.11.A:0 "The Manchu Dragon shall roar again!"
HAR.11.B:0 "Eh, I still prefer the Russians, to be honest...."
HAR.11.desc:0 "With the absence of governance created by the faliure of Zheltorossiyan government to solve the famine, many ethnic groups of Manchuria were left ungoverned, with the greatest authority across the Manchurian countryside  being whatever Mayor rules the scattered city and villages. China is no stranger to power vacuums, knowing very well that a lack of authority is quickly solved by a person with both ambition and power.\n The person that solved this chaos in the countryside was none other than Pu Wei, member of the Aisin Gioro clan, who once ruled not all of Manchuria, but all of China. He had ambition, he had a claim to the land, and above all he had the leadership skills to back up his desires.\n Pu Wei went everywhere to city, always winning supporters and land with his speech:\n 'The Manchu People have been under foreign rule for far too long. The Russian Bears of the North, the Japanese Dragons in the East, and the Han Tigers in the South; all of them desire the riches of Manchuria! This weakness of the Russian oppressor is an opportunity to once again be free. My clan once ruled this land, and we were the masters of the world! Will you die at my side so that our children may live once again?'"

##Priamurye Leaves
HAR.12.t:0 "The Last Stand of the Russian Republic!"
HAR.12.desc:0 "“Hunger. Chaos. Bloodshed.\n The lands of Russia are no strangers to these words, especially with the events that led to the Russian Civil War and it’s aftermath. Zheltorossiya’s whole purpose was to shield the Russians of these factors, and to uphold the free and democratic values that are so essential to the people, even after losing the civil war to the vile Kolchak in the east.\n Kerensky’s administration, who so hopefully desired to bring light and freedom towards Russia, has falied the people with this accursed famine! A pitful end for such a beautiful dream.\n That would be, if it was over. The dream of the Russian Republic lives! At Vladivostok, I, Spiridon Merkulov, will live on. At Vladivostok, the hope of Zheltorossiya will live on, as the Republic of Priamurye. Me and my brothers who survived shall bear the burden of the eternal fight for peace and democracy, and as God as my eternal witness, we shall win, or we shall die trying.” \n Thus spoke Merkulov on the balcony of the temporary Duma, for all of Vladivostok to hear. The city and it’s outskirts, unlike most of the former Zheltorossiyan territory, is largely inhabited by Russians, and the city is a rich port town. There is no better place to begin the new story of Russia."
HAR.12.A:0 "For the Republic! For the People of Russia!"
HAR.12.B:0 "Democracy is dead, the dream is lost.... " 

##Green Ukraine Leaves
HAR.13.t:0 "The Ukrainians Declares A New Wedge!"
HAR.13.A:0 "Formam potribno nadaty zhyttya!"
HAR.13.B:0 "I won’t stray from Harbin… not yet."
HAR.13.desc:0 "When our ancestors migrated to this place, encouraged by free land, the Russian Empire had designs in mind for them. However their lives amounted to more than the grain shipments bound West, on their farms and in their homes, in their abjection, in their prosperity, the Ukranain people found a truth and a romance. We, the breathing shifting mass, have selected Kazmir Malewicz as our manifestor. He will elevate us to Godhood, because we will act upon this world as we please, and our actions will be testament unto themselves. Just as God inseminates his creation with his will to create Goodness, we will inseminate this country with our will, with our being, as it is and not as others would have it. \n Ukrainian officers and enlisted men have long formed a clique in the Zheltorossiyan army, and with the Harbin government’s failures, Ukranian divisions disappear wholesale into the countryside. They have truly severed themselves from the rest of the country and appear to be reorganizing and preparing to operate in their own interests."

##Yakutia Leaves
HAR.14.t:0 "Yakutia Departs From Zheltorossiya"
HAR.14.A:0 "They will march back North, to their only home in this world..."
HAR.14.desc:0 "News came home quickly of the horrendous sights and sounds that consume the capital of the nation Yakutians have been tentatively calling theirs. A march of sorrow proceeded back to Yakutian heartlands, taking themselves and their sanity far away from Harbin. As soon as they were safely away, all who could sing sang a dirge to their futures in Zheltoroosia. Some met the exodus of Yakutians from Zheltorossian lands with smugness and mockery that they had ever trusted the Harbin government, but most shared in their despair. For a time they had all been happy to slot themselves more firmly into the supply chain of the regional economy and reap the benefits of trading for finished goods with a more developed industrial center. \n Their happiness has turned to ash in their mouths, and while it may be easy to blame one faction or another in the ultimate failure of Zheltorossyia, it is only fitting to blame themselves for throwing their lot in with a corrupt government. Yakutian authorities have formally withdrawn from the Zheltorossian government, and those who negotiated its original entry are drafting their resignation letters."
