#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
#IDEAS#
ICE_danish_exiles:0 "The Father's Dream"
ICE_danish_exiles_desc:0 "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. And how rotten indeed, for the holy land of Denmark is ruled over by a cabal of godless communists.\n\nAfter the people of Schleswig-Holstein rose up against the oppressive rule of the teutonic yoke, their rightful King agreed to bring them into his realm. But while the people of Denmark cheered for the liberation of their southern brothers, a few doddering parlimentarians felt outraged that the king freed Danes. They rose up in mutiny against their rightful king and with German assistance, forced the King to flee to his present home.\n\nEvery night, Christian dreams of sitting on his throne in Copenhagen once more. And it will be done, for God wills it."
ICE_lady_promise:0 "The Lady's Promise"
ICE_lady_promise_desc:0 "But there are more things in heaven and earth, Kristján, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. For while the king of Denmark has a plan for Iceland, the people of Iceland have hatched a very different sort of plan. Though the progressive, socialist, and independence parties were all dissolved upon Christian's entrance into Iceland, the ideas that they stood for could not. For the quest to freedom is not a matter of petty politics, but a connection to the soil, to the Lady Of The Mountain, who will awaken and unleash a flood which will push the Danish wretches into the sea, once and for all time."
ICE_another_generation_of_vikings:0 "Another Generation Of Vikings"
ICE_another_generation_of_vikings_desc:0 "When Copenhagen burned red and the Germans invaded, there was a frantic dash to escape the tide of socialism by many. Only a small trifling of Danes could flee, forty thousand or so. But while a small number for Denmark, it was not so small for Iceland, who has had to bear the brunt of their emigration. And while many Icelanders took the fleeing Danes as arms, the reception was not all positive. The island now stands divided between these new and old sons of Denmark, and for how much longer the situation can last is an enigma."
