### FOCUSES ###
SIB_siberian_troubles:0 "시베리아의 동란"
SIB_siberian_troubles_desc:0 "One may say for sure - Russia can’t sort out its own mess. Whatever stability Siberia projects to the outside world is an illusion, and the aftermath of the November Strike of 1935 is evident."
SIB_rampant_crime:0 "날뛰는 범죄자들"
SIB_rampant_crime_desc:0 "How could one claim that Siberia is “stable”, when there’s so much crime committed on our streets? Our reputation as Russia's giant prison camp doesn’t help it, as those inmates who are released or who escape often end up returning to organized crime."
SIB_separatist_agitators:0 "분리주의 선동가들"
SIB_separatist_agitators_desc:0 "Moderates in Siberian Duma claim to have nothing to do with various radicals preaching separation from Russia in small towns and distant villages, but facts point to contrary - all democratic forces in our general-governorate serve a different cause from ours."
SIB_establish_emergency_provisional_directorate:0 "Establish Emergency Provisional Directoriate"
SIB_establish_emergency_provisional_directorate_desc:0 "In order to restore order, Grishin-Almazov decided that Duma is not enough, a council with more powers should be established. And while the list of delegates waits for review, a few days more will pass."

SIB_compromise_with_autonomists:0 "Compromise with Autonomists"
SIB_compromise_with_autonomists_desc:0 "Reconciliation with old friends has brought much needed energy to the ailing administration of Grishin-Almazov. Siberia shall retain and reinforce its own identity, and perhaps, even become free!"

We have dozens if not hundreds of various indigenous minorities scattered around the country, as well as significant European minorities such as Ukrainians, Germans, Poles, Jews and Volga Tatars - and all of those minorities regardless of their origin were repressed by the Tsarists. We shall give cultural autonomy to those peoples, we shall encourage education in their languages, we shall protect the Asian natives from harmful activities of our Russian majority!"
SIB_mimic_swiss_confederation:0 "Mimic Swiss Confederation"
SIB_mimic_swiss_confederation_desc:0 "Siberia is too vast to be governed in a centralized fashion. Russian language, likewise, is not a universal medium of communication, especially since we have recognized our minorities’ rights for preservation of national identity. Each of our country’s cantons shall have a well-developed self-government, a right to set its own local official language and its own taxes (but not in higher amounts than the federal taxes of course)."
SIB_mimic_old_france:0 "Mimic Old France"
SIB_mimic_old_france_desc:0 "Siberia is fit to be centralized, it’s fit to be governed in a way where every department is subordinate to the capital. We have no need for excessive decentralization, as there should be only one tax code, one penal code and one centralized army to secure our people’s freedom. Marianne may be dead, but her spirit lives on in Siberia!"
SIB_local_autonomy:0 "현지 자치"
SIB_local_autonomy_desc:0 "Regardless of how we style our state, it’s still beneficial to grant our municipal authorities power over local decisions. Developmentalism for the win!"

SIB_negotiate_with_church_desc:0 "We need to convince the leaders of the local Orthodox Church that their rights will be guaranteed, but the clergy themselves should participate in our democracy’s development."
SIB_integrate_mensheviks:0 "멘셰비키 흡수"
SIB_integrate_mensheviks_desc:0 "Remnants of banned centre-left factions should be reconciled with and integrated into the greater Autonomist movement."
SIB_integrate_kadets:0 "카데츠 흡수"

SIB_deal_with_economic_chaos:0 "경제혼돈 처리"
SIB_deal_with_economic_chaos_desc:0 "November Strike crippled our economy way less than an event much more global - the Slump.

SIB_popular_land_reform:0 "인민토지개혁"
SIB_popular_land_reform_desc:0 "We don’t have the land reform issue as pressing as in Central Russia, but it would still make good publicity if we help our less fortunate peasants receive a fair amount of land. None shall be poor in free Siberia, not too poor at least."
SIB_massive_subsidies_to_industry:0 "산업을 위한 대규모 보조금"
SIB_massive_subsidies_to_industry_desc:0 "Industrial development of Siberia shall be financed in a managed market way, helping our urban development and reforging Siberia into a modern, consumerist nation with formidable industry. "

SIB_appeal_to_patriotism_desc:0 "Siberian economy shall be defended from foreign competition not by excessive tariffs, but by vigor of Siberia’s patriots who shall invest themselves in our economic development. And once every Siberian citizen becomes a patriot, our prosperity would be guaranteed alongside our sovereignty."
SIB_protect_private_property:0 "Protect Private Property"
SIB_protect_private_property_desc:0 "We are not councilists, we favor the common man but we respect the property rights as well. A capitalist is not an enemy of Siberia, and only protection of private property allows for our people’s deeper transformation into a more respectable nation akin to Americans."
SIB_welfare_state:0 "복지국가"

SIB_first_federal_government_desc:0 "Alexei Grishin-Almazov was a good interim president, but he doesn’t see himself as a politician anymore.

SIB_send_diplomats_to_europe:0 "Send Diplomats to Europe"
SIB_send_diplomats_to_europe_desc:0 "We are a young and democratic nation, and therefore nations of old Europe would be happy to receive such a new and vibrant ally...right?"
SIB_europe_of_our_own_desc:0 "Siberia is a nexus of European civilization in North Asia, but since many small nations to the south and east of us are holding the same values and same culture that we have, it only makes more sense to extend an olive branch to these polities, expanding the definition of Europe to include our neighbors."
SIB_europe_of_our_own:0 "우리만의 유럽"

SIB_colonial_industrialization:0 "Colonial Industrialization"
SIB_colonial_industrialization_desc:0 "Our opposition claims that we exploit Siberia in a colonial way, as if Russia treats its provinces like how Britain treats India or South Africa. Well, coming out of factory smoke on a brand new train, what we can say except - guilty as charged?"

sib.1.desc:0 "Aleksey Gríshin-Almázov is aging. He has gotten back pains over the past few weeks, things have been more stressful and more taxing. He groaned as he saw the amount of paperwork coming for today; but the groan was a mild expression of a much larger issue - Gríshin-Almázov was feeling awful. Everything felt like a farce; he looked around his fancy villa and then thought about the people starving in the countryside - the political divisions facing the country, and how a non-aligned administration can no longer continue. It is clear to him now. He sat up from his chair, his gloved hands slamming on the table as he screams violently, his maid quickly running to him to wonder if he was well. Subsequently, chaos dwindled out of the room as more screaming and swear words were slurred out, and the poor Gríshin-Almázov then sat down... on the floor, and began to whimper and weep. \n\nAfter few hours, Governor General sat down in front of his desk and begun writing in his journal. He came to a realization, that he must create a council of people who have a good idea how to keep this land in one piece. The question is, who would these people be?\n\nPerhaps the answer was in front of his eyes all along, and the only way to bring stability to Siberia is by reinforcing his reign? If he were to fill the Directoriate with Black Hundreds, remove any opponents through violent means, assert the country as Russian and loyal to Petrograd, maybe then, all the problems would be dealt with. If a totalitarian rule keeps things in order, so be it!\n\nOr maybe, that would only worsen things, and Siberia will remain a broken country unless the needs of her people are satisfied? Maybe it's time for a change in course? Aleksey could invite Autonomists into the Directoriate, distance the country from all Tsarist influence and recognize it as Siberian, not Russian. With that and democratization, prosperity might come as well.\n\nAlmázov remembered, that in urban areas there is a rapidly growing movement of so called Solidarists. They came forward with the ideas of a country as an organic unity, of class fellowship in the name of national brotherhood, and reinvention of russian culture. A radical option to be sure, but inviting those people into the Directoriate might be a beginning of something new.\n\nIf one side is chosen, the others will of course be incredibly opposed.

sib.7.desc:0 "Siberia is a dying flower. Governor-General may not want to admit it, but it hasn't been watered in long. It hasn't felt the touch of cold springs against it's vast dirt, and now it is dying; as much as reaction and counterreform have attempted to secure Siberia in the name of Holy Russia, more and more elements, from the countryside to the urban areas attack our local officers and think of what could have been if the other factions had the power, instead. Writers and intellectuals look outside to see policemen shooting innocent people, and slowly but surely more discontent appears around every corner. Illusions of autonomy, Illusions of economic prosperity and illusions of appeal to tradition have lost their appeal in the eyes of the many peoples of Siberia. But no, this does not matter. None of this matters. Governor-General came to Novosibirsk after leaving his dacha and went to a podium, placing down a microphone and preparing speakers, waiting for the crowd to show up. As they huddled around in the cold, the Governor-General began to proclaim: \n \"Subjects of Holy Russia! We have now been given, by the pure and guiding, gentle hand of Petrograd, extensive autonomies which I will list now.\" \n It didn't matter, of course. He was immediately interrupted by an angry mob. This mob, distracting him, did not notice the gunman in their midst who subsequently began to shoot at the Governor-General. Of course, the gunman was immediately annihilated and made into mist, but Almazov was grazed in the shoulder by a bullet, and so he was huddled back to his car. Subsequently, several areas across Siberia, hearing that the Governor-General was shot, immediately declared independence as the Siberian People's Republic and subsequently several smaller soviets were integrated into the larger People's Republic. With Novosibirsk under siege, it seems that the truth finally came out."

sib.12.title:0 "Russian Refugees from the Summer Coup War Arrive"
sib.12.desc:0 "The aftershocks of the cataclysm now shaking all of Central Russia has reached us. The rival cliques of Kolchak and Drozdovsky clash, and in the shadow of struggling titans, the people of Russia must scramble not to be trampled underfoot. Moscow and its environs have been stricken with especial severity; the declaration of the garrison for Drozdovsky and the symbolic importance of Moscow have conspired to ensure the city cannot escape conflict. With the autumn harvest now very much in jeopardy, peasants from Smolensk, Ryazan, and other regions which are now at the mercy of marching armies and inquisitive ‘procurement officers' have been forced to abandon their homes and seek succor elsewhere. They are joined by a steadily growing flow of war orphans, widows, and displaced workers as the conflict expands.\nAnd so they arrive, caked with the dust of the road. Many of the displaced have struggled to find proper accommodations on the trip; our physicians warn that disease is a significant risk among those who arrived packed in boxcars, and have identified symptoms of exposure in a great many of those who traveled the Trans-Siberian Railroad on flatcars, open to the sky. They are the lucky ones; the refugees now arriving bear horrible stories of those forced to make some portion - or more - of the trip on foot, vulnerable to the deprivations of nomadic savages, wild beasts, and God alone knows what else.\nThese people - our countrymen - need a great many things, but the two most largest exigences are basic nutrition and land for productive resettlement. Thankfully, we have a great abundance of both of these things. Land is plentiful in the (mostly) empty lands of Siberia. The onset of the war has seen the near-total collapse of our overseas grain export market, given the sudden recent difficulties in moving products to St. Petersburg - while this has created an economic mess, it means that food, at least, we have no shortage of."
