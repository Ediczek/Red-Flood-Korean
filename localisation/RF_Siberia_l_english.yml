#Brief history
SIB_DESC_MENU:0 "Perhaps, for the entire existence of Siberia as part of the Russian Empire, it was a place of exile, which ultimately had an unpredictable effect for Petrograd in the future. Despite the uneasy living conditions and ruthlessness of the local colonial administration, it became the land of freethinkers, whose scale of inner wealth has not yet been fully explored. Russia is in a long stagnation and is torn apart by the unrest, and what role will Siberia play in its fate?"

SIB_siberian_troubles:0 "Interesting Times"
SIB_siberian_troubles_desc:0 "Even being separated from Central Russia by the Urals, we still can smell its pestilence. Kolchak's administration has been showing signs of decadence for a long time, without offering any positive agenda. Perhaps he almost doesn't care about Siberia now, which is, however, mutually. From the very times when this land became part of Russia, it has the notorious reputation of a cruel frontier and place of exile to which many of those who objectionable to Petrograd are sent, as those inmates who are released or who escape often end up to banditry."
SIB_rampant_crime:0 "Unrest on the Streets"
SIB_rampant_crime_desc:0 "How could one claim that Siberia is “stable” in papers, when there’s so much mob on the streets these days?! Sometimes, explosions are heard in the distance, bandits gather in groups, which are dispersed with varying degrees of success by the police. Really so many criminal elements have recently served their terms in hard labour? There is definitely someone involved in that..."
SIB_separatist_agitators:0 "Separatist Bawlings"
SIB_separatist_agitators_desc:0 "Moderates in Siberian Duma claim to have nothing to do with various radicals preaching separation from Russia in small towns and distant villages, but facts point to contrary - all democratic forces in our general governorate serve a different cause from ours."
SIB_establish_emergency_provisional_directorate:0 "Uneasy Choice"
SIB_establish_emergency_provisional_directorate_desc:0 "An atmosphere of tension hangs on the streets and bureaucratic offices of Novonikolayevsk. The riots still do not subside, and the earth seems to be about to begin to buzz with rumors here and there. To restore order, Grishin-Almazov needs to do something."

#Regionalists
SIB_compromise_with_autonomists:0 "Green-White Waves High"
SIB_compromise_with_autonomists_desc:0 "Grishin-Almazov agreed to transfer power to the local Duma, full of energy and initiative. It is high time for him to retire and, perhaps, this is the moment he has been waiting for so long. Although some of his entourage will be against it, the Regionalists must take power into their own hands in order to rejuvenate the general governorate and turn it into something more worthy than a raw material appendage of Petrograd and a colony. Given the current situation, these people may themselves have the right to decide how to live."
SIB_recognize_our_minorities:0 "시비리 민족정체성"
SIB_recognize_our_minorities_desc:0 "The time of Yermak passed, as the tsarist rule turned into dust. Whoever the peoples inhabiting these lands consider themselves to be, they are citizens of Siberia. We all, one big family, may have a different cultures but we are united in one thing, united in the principle that makes us a nation - the desire to be free. Let's not see each other as strangers, we are all Siberians here!"
SIB_local_autonomy:0 "원주민 유산법"
SIB_local_autonomy_desc:0 "People lived on this land before us, and we must respect their traditions and property. Russia was a colonizer, while we want to give freedom to the indigenous peoples of Siberia.

SIB_deal_with_economic_chaos_desc:0 "One of the steps to strengthen and increase the wealth of our newborn republic, we need to carry out moderate economic reforms, taking into account the experience of world economic crises, as well as the problems of the tsarist management of money flows. One of these steps should be the opening of our own national stock exchange."
SIB_popular_land_reform:0 "모범 농장"
SIB_popular_land_reform_desc:0 "We don’t have the land reform issue as pressing as in Central Russia, but it would still make good publicity if we help our less fortunate peasants receive a fair amount of land. None shall be poor in free Siberia, not too poor at least."
SIB_massive_subsidies_to_industry:0 "산업 비국유화"

SIB_protect_private_property_desc:0 "We are not councilists, we favor the common man but we respect the property rights as well.

SIB_siberian_military:0 "부사관 학교 개설"
SIB_siberian_military_desc:0 "The Army of Siberia is no longer part of Russian armed forces, and everything in its essence should reflect this fact. Central in this plan of a radical change should be the creation of a powerful command structure in the form of a hierarchy of national sergeant councils of different levels of competence."
SIB_modernization_reforms:0 "Development of the Automotive Industry"
SIB_modernization_reforms_desc:0 "All this time, the logistics network of Siberia was rather limited, the tsarist administration had enough of a few small transport routes, mainly related to mining and providing communications between a few large cities. The development of infrastructure and our own auto industry should become a guarantee of our cohesion and security."
SIB_expand_artillery_factories:0 "국방계획"

SIB_appeal_to_patriotism:0 "Institutionalization of Regional Druzhinas"
SIB_appeal_to_patriotism_desc:0 "Along with the administrative resources that Grishin-Almazov had at his disposal, his problems also passed to us. Crime has not gone away, and the influx of refugees clearly does not make the picture any better. The Governor's Police have not been doing their job to the fullest and our government needs to make some changes in the field of public safety. We should give the regions the right to elect and appoint people of good faith and give them the power to help maintain order."

SIB_liberty_for_the_workers:0 "노동자들을 위한 자유!"
SIB_liberty_for_the_workers_desc:0 "While the monarchists have been feeding with promises of reforms for years, and the socialists are simply deceiving the people with fairy tales about fair collective labour and the advantages of materialism, work in the factories and fields of Siberia is not getting any easier. We will give the workers and business executives of Russia freedom - freedom of labour, earnings and forms of ownership."
SIB_solidarisation:0 "연대화"
SIB_solidarisation_desc:0 "To fight in war those who currently stand against us would be a suicidal mission by now. To be frank, we’re not yet ready. Laying the foundations of our new solidary society is the first step to rise above the ruins of Grishin-Almazov's dictatorship."
SIB_siberian_riflemen_experience:0 "시비리 소총대의 가르침"
SIB_siberian_riflemen_experience_desc:0 "This land is fearsome, powerful, and unyielding - qualities we will pass onto our soldiers. Training them in the wild conditions of the Taiga and the Far North will definitely pay for itself."

SIB_redefine_military_hierarchy_desc:0 "There are many of us who froze in the trenches and suffered from the heat during the meat grinder of the Great War and the subsequent revolution.

SIB_feasible_tasks:0 "이행 가능한 업무들"
SIB_feasible_tasks_desc:0 "During an emergency, it's necessary to extend some of our principles to the armed forces. We aren’t like the Whites, who will demand heroism in all cases and we aren’t like the Reds, who will demand to die for the revolutionary cause. We need everyone, and "everyone" should do what they do best. Each complex system is built on a simple underlying structure, if we distribute the tasks of our fighters in accordance with their abilities, it’ll be easier for us to achieve our common goal."
SIB_coordination_headquarters:0 "Coordination Headquarters"
SIB_coordination_headquarters_desc:0 "Under the patronage of the Union, Vlasov will form a committee of the most active and deserving officers in our armed forces for service in an ever-changing environment.

SIB_no_more_whips_and_carrots:0 "당근과 채찍은 이제 그만"
SIB_no_more_whips_and_carrots_desc:0 "The approach to command and control of troops must be innovative. A formal order isn’t enough, and under pressure and fear our men will only end up despising the cause.

As they huddled around in the cold, the Governor-General began to proclaim: \n \"Subjects of Holy Russia! We have now been given, by the pure and guiding, gentle hand of Petrograd, extensive autonomies which I will list now.\" \n It didn't matter, of course. He was immediately interrupted by an angry mob. This mob, distracting him, did not notice the gunman in their midst who subsequently began to shoot at the Governor-General. Of course, the gunman was immediately annihilated and made into mist, but Almazov was grazed in the shoulder by a bullet, and so he was huddled back to his car. Subsequently, several areas across Siberia, hearing that the Governor-General was shot, immediately declared independence as the Siberian People's Republic and subsequently several smaller soviets were integrated into the larger People's Republic. With Novosibirsk under siege, it seems that the truth finally came out."

The rival cliques of Kolchak and Drozdovsky clash, and in the shadow of struggling titans, the people of Russia must scramble not to be trampled underfoot. Moscow and its environs have been stricken with especial severity; the declaration of the garrison for Drozdovsky and the symbolic importance of Moscow have conspired to ensure the city cannot escape conflict. With the autumn harvest now very much in jeopardy, peasants from Smolensk, Ryazan, and other regions which are now at the mercy of marching armies and inquisitive ‘procurement officers' have been forced to abandon their homes and seek succor elsewhere. They are joined by a steadily growing flow of war orphans, widows, and displaced workers as the conflict expands.\nAnd so they arrive, caked with the dust of the road. Many of the displaced have struggled to find proper accommodations on the trip; our physicians warn that disease is a significant risk among those who arrived packed in boxcars, and have identified symptoms of exposure in a great many of those who traveled the Trans-Siberian Railroad on flatcars, open to the sky. They are the lucky ones; the refugees now arriving bear horrible stories of those forced to make some portion - or more - of the trip on foot, vulnerable to the deprivations of nomadic savages, wild beasts, and God alone knows what else.\nThese people - our countrymen - need a great many things, but the two most largest exigences are basic nutrition and land for productive resettlement. Thankfully, we have a great abundance of both of these things. Land is plentiful in the (mostly) empty lands of Siberia. The onset of the war has seen the near-total collapse of our overseas grain export market, given the sudden recent difficulties in moving products to St. Petersburg - while this has created an economic mess, it means that food, at least, we have no shortage of."

Already, the press, radio, and publishing houses are flourishing with a freedom of expression that would shock much of the Empire, from minority cultures and music to debates in the public sphere that slowly, cautiously take on a lively tone.\nThere are caveats, of course. Awakening the Russian spirit in this much-abused land is to be an active process. A bureau of clerks and censors watches carefully – for exclusive chauvinisms, for the most retrograde of tsarist orthodoxy, for the communist and democratic subversion that would undermine this more-perfected form of solidarity. The order and the freedom that were brought to this land will be fortified against the rot. Then, when a greater consciousness is achieved, the Solidarist program will be as natural to the Russian people as the air they breathe."

He wasn’t raised Christian but ever since he started to pray, things began changing around him.\nFirst, he thanked God for the prison guards. After all, he had not been beaten for weeks, and he was given food regularly. He started to see some new faces. The old guards who woke him up with a bucket of icy water in the winter, have disappeared. The new guards gave him a blanket for the nights and seemed to have sympathized with him for some reason. He was thrown in jail for his anti-Kolchak statements, so he expected to live the rest of his life here in Aszino prison, but ever since he turned to God, he felt that getting freed was no longer a delusion.\nHis prayer was cut in half by the noise of the opening cell door. A young guard stepped in, carrying a lamp and some papers.\n“Pyotr Vorobev, right?”\nPyotr nodded.\n“According to an amendment to today’s law in effect, all convicts convicted of crimes related to the expression of opinion will receive amnesty.” the guard read his papers.\n“Get up, you are a free man,” he added.\nPyotr was speechless. His prayers were heard after all!\nAs he walked through the complex, he got his clothes and papers back. He walked out of Aszino prison and stepped into the streets. He wasn’t alone. A small crowd of former prisoners celebrated nearby. He took a deep breath from the cold night air and stretched his numb arms. As his gaze slid into the sky, he noticed that someone swapped the flag at the top of the prison. The old white-green banner was gone, in its place, a tricolor patterned standard was waving with a weird symbol in its middle.\nHe didn't look at it for long. He had a new life to start."

Without going into details, we must negotiate with local industrialists. We can offer some of them to buy out their share from the budget, so we will be less dependent on them in case of unpredictability. Oh yes, and do everything possible from us to enlist the support of as many Siberian workers as possible, regardless of occupation.

In the shortest possible time, it is necessary to re-open the “Posev” publication and launch radio stations to attract people from all over Russia to our banners. Don’t worry, the rules for joining the NTS will be the same as before, the qualification remains unchanged.” - Stolypin assured his partners.\n “I, like probably most of those gathered here, share your position, thank you.

Of course, not all will respond, but if at least one is interested, then it will already be worth it. In addition, our "eagles" throughout Russia need to have conditions for the presence of a permanent communication channel.

He hoped it wouldn't come to that. However, it was necessary to somehow establish connections. But not the old ways. Walking ahead of his detachment, he caught himself thinking - will it work?\nAlready approaching the village, he noticed how people in a hurry began to disperse to their homes. Fear? Old habit. Nobody is going to bully anyone. But this deaf, mundane, rural Russia can also be understood.\n\n"Do not be afraid, people! We have come to you in peace. We have an offer, can you call the headman?"\n\nPeople, looking at the aliens, noticed something in them. Neither faces nor tunics had been seen before. From a two-story wooden house, diverging in length in two directions, a graying man came out, about 50 years old, strong-looking, obviously plowed over a field for hundreds of miles.\nFirst of all, he looked at the caps of those who came. He had never seen these before. Rather reminiscent of kepi, not guards caps and not cloth helmets. The headman came closer to them and saw the emblem on their headdresses.\n\n“Who are you lot? Why did you come with this Ukrainian symbol on your hats? What are you, Petliurites? Captured Moscow and now come to take away our grain? Oh, woe to us...”\nArtyom exchanged glances with his associates and laughed.\n“- What kind of Petliurites we are, if you please?”\n“- God knows, the time is now such that you can expect anything.

And so to the thread for a year many bandits want to rob us, we have nothing!”\n“- Listen, let me finish. We want to buy grain from you. We will agree on the price.”\nTikhon was a little taken aback. They came to buy? What's going on at all?! Usually armsmen were coming to take away.\n“- Buy, you say...” - said Tikhon, looking for a catch in the proposal.\n“- That's right, half the amount now, half when we will leave” - reassuringly answered Artyom, feeling how pairs of eyes were looking at him with distrust and apprehension.\nTikhon smacked his lips.\n“- Well, if you're not joking, let's have a seat to discuss it.” - said Tikhon, pointing to the city hall."
