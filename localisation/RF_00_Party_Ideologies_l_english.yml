Yet for so many so-called \"republicans,\" the states they construct are not truly of the people, but simply a license for license. A freedom to be left alone. What a farce! How can a citizen be free when their neighbor, their city, their nation, and their world is enslaved? This is the downfall of the \"civil republic,\" which, in reality, is nothing more than machinations of capital and false liberty.\n\nSocial Republicanism emerged out of a dissatisfaction with the notion of a civil republic, as well as the cosmopolitan stain it left on socialism as a whole. The term finds its origins in the revolutionary left of 1848, those brave Communards and patriots who pushed back against the liberal wings of the revolutions across Europe. These often maligned heroes were those who stood valiantly against the states of yore, attempting to set up a republic truly made of and ruled by the peoples of a nation, not one of a nation ruling the peoples.\n\nOpposed to the simple application of universalist principles, Social Republicanism emphasizes the need to look at the traditions of liberty among a national body, following the thread of justice through the fabric of time. A social republic is not a state, nor a polis of Plato, but the organization of the entire national demos as rulers of themselves. Because of its ties to particular histories and nations, its manifestations are as numerous as countries, yet all hold common principles such as a commitment to democracy, a focus on national romanticism, and the need of a vanguard of, by, and for the people to guide the republic. Nevertheless, in all cases, it weaves a story of liberation and anti-domination throughout the ages, one in which the living are no more privileged than the dead, and which the flame of the ancestors is brought forward, leaving the ashes of the past behind."

vperedism:0 "Vperedism"
vperedism_desc:0 "In the eyes of a European observer, Communism and Accelerationism are usually seen as eternal enemies. Yet — noticed by many reactionary and moderate critics — there exist deep similarities between their doctrines: the bold impulse to completely reorder the world and bring forth a new mankind. That similarity is what lies at the roots of Vperedism, a movement that embraces both the socialist proletarian revolution and the avant-garde project of a new modernity.\n\nVperedism owes its name to a split among the Russian Social Democrats — between the Vpered faction of Alexander Bogdanov and the followers of Vladimir Lenin — over the question of revision of Marx in certain epistemological issues. While the former came to assert their dominance in the Party, Lenin remained influential in the Second International, and the Vperedists had to pay a bitter price for their heresy. Bogdanov was officially denounced at the 9th Congress of the International, pushing Vperedism even further to the margins of the communist movement. Yet, Lenin was not without critics. Many comrades banded together in defence of Bogdanov, forming the dissident Third International: a place for those too radical and unconventional for the doctrines of Orthodox Marxism.\n\nWhile the Third International doesn't enforce a clear theoretical line, two ideas are usually defining for Vperedist movements: the primacy of the struggle of humanity against nature over social struggles, and the pivotal role of culture. Together they create a radically Promethean vision of the revolution, not only of an end to capitalist oppression, but also a transformative event for humanity itself — an unshackling of the collective will from internal struggles, now united to fight together for a glorious future. A socialism for the 20th century cannot stop at the promise of comfortable life for everyone, but should demand more: the abolition of death itself, the unending war against still matter, the collective realisation of what was once thought to be mysterious sorcery. And above all socialism has a duty to achieve the ultimate destiny of mankind: to claim the stars and spread life in the Universe, to reach dominion over the whole Cosmos.\n\nAre such dreams too bold for a harsh reality? Or are the mainline communists mired in ideas belonging to the 19th century? No matter how dark things may seem for the war-scarred humanity, the Vperedists continue to believe there is a wondrous future waiting to be claimed, brighter than anything one can imagine."

In the Aboriginal cultures of Australia, the land itself was birthed from this thread, in what they called "the Dreaming." It is from this very seam - this dreamlike crack between worlds - that Surrealism was birthed from.\n\nDespite what he might wish to be the truth, Surrealism did not spring from the mind of André Breton fully formed. A term coined by Guillaume Apollinaire of later Escadron fame, Surrealism was first used to describe the music of Erik Satie; a reality beyond reality. From this, the eponymous artistic movement began to take shape, but the Surrealist Pontificate would not be headed by Apollinaire, but rather by the aforementioned Breton - his dual manifestos would define the form as it would come to be known, as the Twin Testaments of the Surreal.\n\nYet it was only in 1927 that Surrealism would take the leap from the artistic to the political, as the expulsion of the Surrealists from the nascent SFIO over participation with the Artaud mayorship would lead to them creating their own vehicle; the Parti Surréaliste Français. Quickly, the PSF would become dominated by its leader, and Surrealism began to take form as a bastard child birthed from the incestuous rutting between utopian socialism of the 19th century and avant-garde sensibilities of the 20th.\n\nWhile some on the left have simply denounced Surrealism as "Bretonistic revisionism" propagated in a Bismarckian fashion to fill the proletariat's head with lies, the movement itself branches far beyond what words fall out of the open maw of its founder. The power of modernity to bring forth the primaeval, the superiority of the unconscious over the conscious, the triumph of the metaphysical over the dialectical, the rending of reality; these are concepts shared by many, and executed in a plethora of divergent methods - the Surrealist bouquet has many blossoming flowers. After all, in a world where the logic of two and two makes industrial slaughter, who can blame the men who dare to dream of something beyond the real?"

But while the Völkisch movement of Germany exists in a liminal space between a romantic past and the industrial present, there are those that embrace the scare of modernity, willing the gears of history to grind onward. Ancient myths and folk beliefs are brought to life and given a second baptism, as under the aegis of Neo-Folkism, the carriage of the past is saddled to the runaway horses of the future.\n\nThis new face of folkism was born out of the crisis of modernity, as many countries either succumbed to the siren song of cosmopolitanism or closed themselves off in reactionary shells. The Neo-Folkists rejected those answers, they chose the impossible; they embraced the rapture of modernity, wielding it as a sword against the apathy of traditionalism and the egotistical march of internationalism. Seeped in the ink of authors such as Jan Stachniuk and the Carnaliste group of Marc Augier, Neo-Folkists took up arms against those to their left and right, cutting a path forward to secure an existence for their people and a future for their children.\n\nTurning their eyes towards their own people, Neo-Folkists tend to shine a new light upon old ideas. Many of them throw out Christ, Jehovah, and other messianic figures in favour of a rejuvenation of the pantheist - or pagan -  faith inherent in their blood and rooted in their soil. Yet whether they wish to do away with all alien religion or simply mould it into a visage of the people, all Neo-Folkists embrace a vitalist view of faith, worshipping life itself and all that springs from it. As such, Neo-Folkists tend to embrace the collective destiny of a people based on aspects such as a shared creative energy, leaning towards socialized means of economic management, yet without succumbing to materialist worship of the international worker. It is due to this same collective destiny that democracy is often shrank down to the local level, if not trampled entirely; after all, the will of the people can manifest itself best without parliamentarians splitting it apart.\n\nThere are thousands of peoples, and there are thousands of folks; Neo-Folkism, drawing upon local roots, differs wildly from nation to nation. Yet above all else, they are united by one truth: the primordial gods and heroes of the past are alive yet still, and soon they shall find themselves fighting to defend the homeland once again."

Distilling a people from the muck of democracy requires those who not only simply wish to experience a full and free life, but have the energy to seize it, too.\n\nGabriele d'Annunzio was one such man, and the song that the Viceroyalty of Carnaro proudly sings has had profound reverberations. In spite of his claims of imminent national and international revolution being swiftly proven false, his efforts remained a beacon to whose guiding light many around the world flocked.\n\nIlluminated by the Fiuman torch-light, the ethos of the city-state and its followers coalesced around principles unconstrained by the traditional political sphere. Revolutionary nationalism, anti-imperial rhetoric, single-party ruling coalitions, and class collaborationist economics play a prominent role, of course, but of equal — if not greater — importance was the mindset embodied by the enigmatic poet-king. Renewal of a country's body politic cannot occur only in the houses of government, but in the theatres, poetry clubs, and coffee houses too.\n\nTo lead a people into a better future requires vibrant souls; it requires men who take life by the throat.

mystical_anarchism_desc:0 "Many agitators proclaim that revolution and social progress must go deeper than the political sphere in order to effect lasting change. Some delve into the cultural and social minutia, arguing over the best policies and dynamics. A few Promethean souls however, plunge into the domain of the soul. Mystical Anarchism preaches that spiritual revolution is just as critical, if not more so, than the social one. It is the vehicle by which the collective soul of mankind can be truly emancipated. By tearing down the antiquated structures of the past and liberating the masses from heedless servitude to institutions and ideas that corral the human spirit, an ultimate liberation is possible.\n\nWhat might be described as "orthodox" Mystical Anarchism is formed from a synthesis of mainstream anarchist theory, while its praxis and mystic philosophy is produced by Symbolist groups, including such figures as Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Georgy Chulkov in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Others claim far earlier sources of inspiration, such as the medieval writings of Marguerite Porete, and even ancient gnostic works. It has since spread further afield, coalescing with similar conclusions across the globe, consolidating it into something greater.  Mystical Anarchists can be broadly identified apart from their anarchist cousins by several factors, the first of which is a spiritual broadmindedness, uncompromising moral values quite often of a vaguely Christian character, though some veer off this road in favour of more occult or oriental pursuits. Secondly, a faculty of mystical perception, an ability to recognise spiritual aspects in one's environment and in metaphorical texts. Finally, a profound urge towards the ultimate principle of the Universe. \n\nIndeed it can be said that fundamentally, the emancipation of society is but a means to an end. The "new man" must be liberated internally also, unleashed from bondage to the world as it appears. Some Mystical Anarchists connect this worldview with the Christian Apocalypse, whilst others are of a more esoteric persuasion, and some blend of the two. Individual liberty itself is to be surpassed in favour of a "supra-individualism", a transcendental oneness, for all men share in the Divine - a mystical transformation, self-realization in its truest sense. The way forward is clear. The revolution must be twofold, or it is nothing."

stratocratic_anarchism_desc:0 "The historical record is replete with visionaries seeking alternatives to unjustified hierarchy and exploitation. They amass followers in the name of the betterment of man's conditions, of personal liberty, and sometimes separate themselves from wider civilization to live autonomously according to their values. The historical record is also replete with examples of these visionaries being suppressed by the organized armies of the state, capable of leveraging military production and coordination as a force multiplier against the masses. In the face of the incinerating pressure inherent in conducting a revolution against entrenched authority, a new form of organization occasionally emerges: that of Stratocratic Anarchism.\n\nWhile there are arguably quasi-military organizations in the past that might serve as an inspiration, such as groups practicing social banditry, the conflicts at the end of the Great War provided examples of how revolutions may be conducted. In the Russian Civil War, one of the prominent revolutionary military leaders was Nestor Makhno, a committed anarchist. Before his desperate alliance with the socialists, and before the retreat into the Caucasus, he helmed an army of insurgents that alternately protected and governed a network of communes in Ukraine. The morality of their means was debated for years to come, and yet…\n\nStratocratic Anarchism, then, is the answer to the question of how the movement expects to protect itself and its gains. It is the revolutionary élan of libertarian struggle welded to the vessel of military structure. The order of the day varies from location to location, whether the army is a democratic body, or how mobilization of the population occurs, but the results can prove surprisingly effective on the battlefield. Of course, it is nothing if not controversial among fellow anarchists — even if military discipline is necessary for victory, can it be trusted to relax after the guns fall silent? In a world where the forces arrayed against true freedom have grown more vicious, however, let no one say the anarchists have not risen to the challenge."
national_anarchism:0 "National Anarchism"
national_anarchism_desc:0 "Anarchism has rarely made a pleasant bedfellow of nationalism. Much like their socialist cousins, the historical anarchist perspective is that nationalism is an obstacle to the brotherhood of men, the accelerant of militarism, and perhaps goes hand in hand with the formation of the modern state itself. For the majority of the cause, this is uncontroversial. Curiosities existed — the future anarchist luminary Mikhail Bakunin spent the revolutions of 1848 as an ideologue who would not be entirely out of line with the League of Fiume, advocating for a mass cooperative uprising of nationalist movements to destroy the great empires of Europe.\n\nYet like it did for so many other schools, the Great War and its aftermath upset the old balance. Mirroring some socialist parties supporting the war effort of their homelands, a number of prominent anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin and Jean Grave publicly favoured an Entente victory over the Central Powers, which they saw as an obstacle to revolution. While not a formal unity of ideologies, it demonstrated how anarchist principles could interact with national interest. More vivid was the Futurist doyen Marinetti's erstwhile alliances with Italian anarchists, which he advocated based on a shared desire to destroy bourgeois politics and morality. Perhaps it was opportunism and provocation, but was it entirely contradictory?\n\nNational Anarchism, to cover the wide array of movements grouped under it, can be described glibly as anarchism stripped of its humanist precepts - anti-state, but patriotic, even ultranationalist. A number of their organizations have gained increased cachet by harnessing strident right-wing critique of the postwar order. For some, the government as they know it is an obstacle to the elitist or heroic national ideal they stand for, and it must be decentralized into more autonomous units. Others seek the destruction of the country altogether and its disintegration into homogenous communes reflecting more primordial identities. One thing is for certain: when the centre falls, the people's hands will be freed to do what is right and necessary."
stratocratic_socialism:0 "Stratocratic Socialism"
stratocratic_socialism_desc:0 "The socialist revolutionary and the state's military are traditional enemies — the purging of the Paris Commune, the defeat of the left in the Russian Civil War, and the myriad socialist-aligned revolts sabered down by colonial garrisons have left their scars. However, under certain conditions, an avowed socialist finds themselves in charge of the army and the state at the same time, often due to the collapse of the civilian government's authority. Whether political power has passed to the army, or a warlord has ambitions of governing a socialist republic, the regime that emerges is characterized as Stratocratic Socialism.\n\nTo some extent, the Great War provided a theoretical pretext for this political arrangement. Even though the concept of "total war" was being explored and glorified by Prussian general staffers who sought a complete militarization of society, similar ideas were discussed in the civil wars of the late 1910s, including by socialist officers in Russia. Elsewhere, such as in revolutionary Mexico, some generals would struggle in the battlefield while implementing land and social reforms in the territories they controlled. Somewhere between social banditry and military junta, the avowedly red military commander has ultimate authority over an area and governs accordingly.\n\nUnder this particular form of socialism, the vanguard party is either subordinate to the military, or the military itself serves the same purpose. At times, military buildup and warfare prioritizes an outsized amount of the state's focus and resources. At others, the army is an effective, if forceful, means of clearing the ground for socialist policy via putting immediate force to state designs. Many of the advantages traditionally ascribed to a conventional military dictatorship apply here, but it is open to fears that the Red Army, or People's Militia, or whatever governs the state becomes an end in itself rather than a means — a Red Prussia governed by a privileged in-group of officers. Still, they would counter — with some justification — that when the revolution must go to war to survive, there is nobody better suited for the task."
national_syndicalism:0 "National Syndicalism"
national_syndicalism_desc:0 "While the term "syndicalism" is sometimes used interchangeably with its more leftist school, it would ignore the other tendency which has gone on to have an enduring effect: National Syndicalism. Like its sibling, it originated in France before the Great War, then went on to have an outsized influence on the other Latin countries of Europe. Frustrated by the political limits of the legal socialist parties, the unions — syndicats, in French — were beginning to self-organize into non-parliamentary organizations capable of striking and agitating for their own goals. In fact, it was reasoned, the governance of the state could one day fall into the hands of the unions themselves should they unleash a suitably large general strike.\n\nHowever, in syndicalism's native France, the radicals on the left and right who opposed the Third Republic were beginning to cross-pollinate ideas with one another. Georges Sorel, perhaps the chief theoretician of syndicalism, was enamored with revolutionary violence against the perceived corruption of the liberal state, and this brought him close to the monarchist Action Française of Charles Maurras. The unintuitive alliance of the two currents, united largely by opposition to democracy, was exemplified by episodes like Maurras' appreciation of explicitly undemocratic socialism alongside Sorel's brief embrace of integral nationalism. They were not alone — in Italy, too, similar connections were being made between syndicalist leaders who embraced patriotism and nationalist anti-liberals such as the ANI.\n\nIn practice, National Syndicalism has come to occupy a middle ground between the more leftist syndicalists and some of the syncretic accelerationist camp. While a number of anti-Marxist syndicalists have been siphoned off by the Fiumean example, it has left a core of fighters who believe in class struggle just as they believe in revolutionary nationalism. Motivated by more than naked materialism and lofty theories, they seek a new order of proletarian vitality, undoing the aimlessness of the liberal-bourgeois consensus and restoring meaning to life and work. Internally, however, National Syndicalist views on the specifics of government and economics can be eclectic, with some favouring the pure union-based model and others looking fondly on corporatism to unite the nation."

While frequently decried as an anti-patriotic force, not all who wave the red flag have forgotten the one of their country, and see their interests in alignment. Is it out of insufficiently-developed consciousness? Or would to deny one's homeland be to march out of step with its own working class? For the socialist parties that chose the latter, they came to define the ideology of Nationalist Socialism.\n\nThis phenomenon is the culmination of a few trends in the early twentieth century. Generally, in less developed countries, it is another manifestation of the nation-building project. In this case, its adherents see state-directed economic policy as a tool of development, for fostering productive growth and national solidarity among the masses. In Europe, the outbreak of the Great War would also make many socialists choose their fatherlands over international brotherhood, some even coming to view the directed war economy and sense of collective unity as similar to their goals. Even before then, a number of Italians saw the expansion of their empire in Africa and entry into the Great War as a revolutionary task — against the wealthy empires of the world, was Italy not comparatively a proletarian nation?\n\nNationalist Socialism as a doctrine is far from concrete. Some of its adherents were drawn to Accelerationism, or to more authoritarian forms of socialism, leaving it sometimes defined by what was left behind. These movements are still generally parliamentary and socialist, but have stopped well short of embracing the old Marxist line that the worker has no homeland. This tends to place them in opposition to parties avowedly of the Second International. Additionally, whether for practical developmentalist reasons or out of a sense of solidarity, these socialists tend to be much more accommodating to "patriotic bourgeoisie" who can contribute to the socialist task with their industry and wealth. Decried as revisionist in text and spirit, it is nonetheless a reminder that the Social Democrats of Berlin do not speak for all proletarians with their sensibilities."

For despite what historians in London may preach, and contrary to what the theoreticians in Germany will tell you, the idea of Utopian Socialism is not yet dead: it is just waking up.\n\nWhat is referred to as Utopian Socialism in fact comprises many doctrines, from the libidinal phalansteries of Charles Fourier, to the whirring industrialism of Henri de Saint-Simon, and many more. Yet despite this diversity, all of them are united in a single vision: the perfection of humanity itself. Utopians generally have a positive view of human nature, rarely advocating for violent revolutions, and instead believing in the power of diligent labor to overcome the injustices of capitalism while stressing the importance of strong moral principles necessary to build a new world. The detractors of utopianism like to call this sentiment naïve, these dreams impossible, tested by the steel trial of modernity. Yet, the high ideals still garner followers.\n\nThe visions of a new spring for humanity, freed from petty greed and living in perfect harmony with each other never cease to captivate readers, drawn to a flickering hope of overcoming the crisis of modernity. As stormclouds gather across the globe, the peoples of Earth ask themselves: is Utopian Socialism really destined for the dustbin of history?

It is a time-worn bit of rhetoric to look at the practice of an ideology or movement and describe it in such a way, as equally dogmatic as the most hidebound sect. The jab is all the more amusing when it lands on an avowedly materialist or atheistic worldview, and the socialists and outright communists know it well. However, as the search for meaning in the modern world produced all manner of cults and scholarly groups, it was inevitable that some would synthesize socialism with a niche spiritual vision. When such an organization finds itself with political power, the resulting form of governance has been termed Esoteric Socialism.\n\nWhether because one's strain of socialist thought is primarily non-materialist, or simply goes hand-in-hand with a spiritual or millenarian vision, the result is something altogether unlike a conventional socialist movement. Rather than a vanguard or parliamentary party, the Esoteric Socialist model may rely on a a religious or secret society as its main center of political power, perhaps initially functioning within an existing party. While the structure of this organization is often undemocratic and hierarchical, the rituals by which a member is initiated can serve to ensure their solidarity with the group and commitment to its political principles. However fallible man is in the quest for equality, giving his work a spiritual dimension can strengthen his will, whether to care for his brother in arms or for the uninitiated masses.\n\nLargely theoretical as the world entered the 1930s, it remains to be seen what tendency will predominate — be it an offshoot of Marxism first, or a more spiritual worldview that comes to similar conclusions. Whether a perversion of socialism, or a means of granting it greater meaning, Esoteric Socialism defies easy categorization. Yet so too does a world wracked by the pained spasms of modernity.

Yet the victorious German Social Democrats worked within the parliamentary system until it became impossible for them. Eduard Bernstein, the head of the SPD's right, would even define socialism as a form of organized liberalism. The task of reconciliation between the two sides' ambitions may fall to the theoreticians of Liberal Socialism.\n\nThe foundations of the tendency generally begin with English reformists, though not entirely. John Stuart Mill, ostensibly the leading light of British liberalism in the nineteenth century, wrote on the ideal of democracy as the principle of social organization, but also held that means such as economic redistribution and worker-owned cooperatives would be required to realize this. Later on, the Fabians would expound on a moral economy, committed to social justice, that cuts out the exploitative rentier class. Proudhon's extolling of worker self-management and Sombart's writing on mixed economies would also sow the seeds on the European continent. Immanent political concerns saw the ideology expand further, as those who joined the German and Hungarian revolutions adapted to their new reality, in the case of the liberals, or chafed under the mobilization and state terror required to secure their gains, in the case of some of the socialists.\n\nThus was realized the present state of Liberal Socialism. In practice, it generally seeks an order of decentralized power, principles of egalitarianism and voluntarism, and a mixed private-public economy. Whether to secure the allegiance of a revolutionary middle class or to achieve the ambitions of freedom that the bourgeoisie frustrate at every turn, it has thus remained a dissident current in some parts of the world despite political polarization.

Though it was far from a linear or universal process around the world, and though many would try to reverse it, throne and altar lost much of their temporal authority in the age to follow. Obvious critique of the new liberal state of affairs came from the traditionalists, but they were not the only ones. By the middle of the nineteenth century, a new alternative had emerged, that of Progressive Corporatism.\n\nThe concept of corporate organization of mankind is an ancient one. Even Plato and Aristotle could envision a model where people were sorted into bodies according to their role in society. The great guilds of feudal Europe that organized themselves by profession are an example of this in practice — but they would not remain an ideal for the traditionalists alone. As industrialization and class tensions intensified, and the breakdown of traditional social relations like the family and guild led to alienation, sociologists and philosophers would begin to advocate for new organizations to rebuild solidarity between people.\n\nInto this world of Saint-Simon and Durkheim stepped Catholic social teaching. Pope Leo XIII commissioned studies of corporatism, and in 1891 published the encyclical "Rerum novarum," which stressed the need for an economy based on justice and dignity, blessed the trade unions, and empathetically called for collaboration between capital and labour. While not every successor to the Throne of St. Peter was of the same mind, the Vatican's search for a course between capitalism and socialism — without rejecting the Enlightenment itself — inspired many.\n\nWhether anchored in religious distributism or guild socialism, Progressive Corporatism still navigates between the anomie of liberalism, the dehumanization of militant modern politics, and reactionary atavism. The state, having granted rights to collective organizations and classes as a whole, pushes them to collaborate for broader societal betterment and harmony. In a world riven with conflict, it stresses there is still time for devotion to one another."

After all, the Republic had consciously emphasized the French people as a whole, rather than their divided ruling houses. In the aftermath of that tumult, when the old order sought to reassert itself, both ideals had their aspirations frustrated, and in some cases would become a united cause against the kings and empires atop them. Additionally, through the latter half of the 1800s, some liberal movements that already had a voice in government grew more concerned with the national interest. What resulted came to be called National Liberalism.\n\nThe ideology can seem a tangle of contradictions at first glance. Where national independence had come late, preoccupation with a united population and a state strong enough to preserve its independence led to compromises on the standard liberal upholding of individual rights and free economic activity. Protectionism and state subsidy to support local industry was no longer taboo, and a powerful central government was a necessary trade-off for national mobilization or maintaining control of a population with major divisions of identity. As such, it became a dominant strain of liberalism in places that were long subservient to large empires, but also in the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires that were seeking to clamp down on regionalism in the first place. An ocean away, the Progressive Movement in the United States would also include liberal reformers who pursued a more assertive foreign policy and aggressively tried to subsume regional and immigrant identities into a united American nationalism.\n\nBut what will be the legacy of this National Liberalism? Does it illustrate the limits of the Enlightenment foundations it claims? Is it a muscular rejoinder to an age of "big stick" diplomacy and industrial warfare, a liberalism that marches alongside the vigorous national state? Whatever the truth, the pragmatism of the ideology makes it an effective collaborator with other parties of the centre.

It would also be a mistake, however, to categorize all of the rightist agitators as atavists, retrograde obscurantists. Sometimes it will come to be that a political movement becomes wrapped around a charismatic figure and the grievances they voice, and that voice may speak in familiar language of old values, national pride, and strong leadership while being committed democrats. Where conservatism arrives in this guise, intent on shaking up a hidebound political establishment, it can be identified as a form of Right Wing Populism.\n\nLike its leftier counterpart, this tendency at times begins in a movement external to political structures, before it becomes a party or a faction of an existing one. Similarly, starting outside of the established political theatre can lead to political platforms that are eclectic or syncretic. Like other conservatisms, its economic agenda could skewer a regime of high taxes and restrictions, or seek to wield the regulatory state to preserve old and domestic industries. What defines it as right wing tends to be a greater emphasis on traditional order - and if the common man generally hopes that tomorrow will be not too dissimilar from today, is crypto-socialism from a party elite or economic elitism from the capital really representative of the people?\n\nRight Wing Populism can prove surprisingly effective despite all of the obstacles against outsiders. A sense of authenticity, and occasionally shared priorities, can expand the voting base and electoral alliances available to the movement. Likewise, being unafraid of upsetting the political balancing acts of the past can allow a leader to reshape the nation more quickly than expected.

In the medieval merchant republics of Europe, the post-revolutionary liberal states, and even the old Roman Republic, there existed a class of men who, rather than by a noble birth, owed their stature to their fortunes and the influence this provided. The great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and so on — criticisms of this monied aristocracy's influence on politics have dogged them wherever they have gone. While oligarchical systems of power are hardly unique, and hereditary rulers may find themselves amassing wealth through their inherited holdings, a Plutocracy is control over the government by an elite purely selected by their wealth.\n\nBut what makes a mere flawed democracy or authoritarian regime into a plutocratic one? It is rare that there is a council of men directly appointed due to their wealth, selecting a first-among-equals from their ranks to dictate the government's affairs with an eye for profit. Rather, it is in the subversion of a pre-existing system that Plutocracy grows, whether by leveraging the influence of its elite class or becoming elected officials themselves to represent their interests. Alternatively, like the Dutch East India Company - which had diplomatic, judicial, and currency-minting powers of its own - a board of investors may outright pull the strings of government, perhaps due to a collapse of the state.\n\nPlutocracy has been used as a pejorative label in the vast majority of cases. From the left, the right, or even the population at large, a suspicion exists that the priorities of this system align only with the direct interests of this class. This can mean that material benefits accrue at the top to the detriment of the bottom, or privilege international investments over domestic ones. However, at its most charitable, the financial elite have a vested interest in maintaining the stability of their investment, bringing their own interests into synchronicity with those of the country.

The dissolute liberalism that has been the midwife of national confusion and political gridlock typifies this. However, the concept of representative democracy, the people having a voice in their government rather than out-of-touch aristocrats, is not inherently flawed. The citizen democracies of Athens and Rome once intimately tied the franchise to patriotic duty and military service. Shorn of its liberal trappings — weaknesses — a purified and strengthened execution of the concept emerges: that of National Democracy.\n\nBut what defines this tendency other than a vague notion of illiberal republicanism? Arguably, the first theoretician to coin the name was the Polish nationalist Roman Dmowski. While his credentials were marred by accommodation with the Russian Empire, his Endecja organization advanced the concept of a democratic, yet anti-pluralist and centralized Poland. The short-lived far-right government in post-war France, while chiefly associated with monarchism, also had a republican wing equally vociferous in denouncing the factionalism of the Third Republic. While some of their heirs would abandon democracy entirely, others saw that the unity of the people and nation could be expressed through the political party and democratic process, sometimes with the leader as the embodiment of the demos.\n\nIn practice, National Democracy favours stronger government powers. If the leader or the party embody the people, then they should be able to discard certain limitations that liberal constitutionalism places on the majoritarian will. Thus empowered, the regime is capable of marginalizing the deemed threats to national unity, political and cultural. While this sometimes places the two halves of the ideology's name in competition with one another, the label refers to governments that still maintain democratic structures within the party and without, however opposition might be discouraged. Freed of the structural rot of liberalism, they would counter, this ideology allows for the only kind of representative government that will not fall into the pages of history."

The need for constitutional reform becomes so dire that the system willingly takes itself apart to rebuild, renegotiating the terms of its agreement with itself or former political outsiders. However it was accomplished, the rough beast of the future slouches toward power to be born, and the abstract questions of the future give way to the practical realities of "what now." In this interstitial period, what administers the new state is often a Provisional Government.\n\nLess an ideology and more of a compromise, this term describes a temporary system that maintains the day-to-day functions of society while the first structures of government are drawn up. The reality of politics is that a movement for grand change rarely has a unified vision of what life after this change should look like, especially on the finer details of administration. Some machinery must be put in place to manage debate and keep public order in the interim, one that generally involves appointed or collective leadership. After the transitional period ends, power is then ceded to the government it fostered the creation of, often with an inaugural election.\n\nThe contradictions of a Provisional Government are many on its surface. However democratic the eventual plan of government is, the means of safeguarding it often leave little room for public input. Stability of the process is paramount, but it is also designed to be dismantled when its time has passed. Is a strong hand to watch over the proceedings a sign of approaching dictatorship? Would loosening the grip too early risk a collapse of the government's careful negotiations? For a time, in this liminal state, everything is possible. But one should be aware: in politics, there is nothing more permanent than a temporary solution."
colonial_government:0 "Colonial Government"
colonial_government_desc:0 "Even something that is so apparently self-evident as colonialism has evolved with time. Some features seem eternal: the justifications of seeking land, markets, and resources, or extending the breadth of one's faith and empire, and so on. But as the claimed land has expanded, and technology and administrative expertise have grown with it, the systems of governance have become more sophisticated as well. The means of control always bear investigating when examining a Colonial Government.\n\nA colony is not an integral part of its patron state. This may be an eventual goal of the colonial project, and direct settlement could be encouraged for that very reason, but the same governmental system typically does not apply an ocean way. Instead, the government of the day tends to answer to the imperial capital, even submitting laws and governing statutes for approval. However, as settlement dwindled over centuries, and greater spans of populated territory were claimed for economic and strategic reasons, administration had to become more complex to ensure stable rule and resource extraction. On one hand, even colonies that were not given a say in the affairs of the home country were increasingly given powers of local government, sometimes an appointed or advisory body of notables who could ostensibly bring local concerns to the administration's policies. On the other, preexisting authorities — kings, chiefs, and so on — were increasingly integrated into the colonial system, being given some autonomy in the system so long as they leveraged their station and connections to bring taxes and recruits back to the capital.\n\nColonial Government is thus more than lines painted on a map for a foreign country to tap. The relationships, both political and commercial, that make it possible to administer these lands without a tide of settlers and an expensive garrison are deceptively complex. Overall, there has been a trend towards greater self-government for colonies, especially with the costs of the Great War and the sociopolitical tensions it produced. Whether the remaining colonies of the world are headed for a dramatic breaking point like the late British Raj, or a continued rethinking of the imperial relationship, is anyone's guess."
praetorian_oligarchy:0 "Praetorian Oligarchy"
praetorian_oligarchy_desc:0 "The military has been, with all its faults and glories, one of the cornerstones of human civilization and a key political player throughout all of history. It has served as a wheel of fortune for regimes and entire nations, and even today it is an indispensable tool for all states worthy of the name. A dark truth of this reality is that, on occasion, this proximity to power only creates an insatiable craving for it.\n\nWhether out of necessity or ambition, the "army with a state" archetype is both a possibility and a danger. It may be that a determined political goal is pursued through the force of arms, which necessitates the creation of a militant organisation. Before long, the movement discovers itself uniformed and marching to the beat of war-drums, their organs following strict discipline and chain of command, their leaders greeted now with a stern salute, and their mythos transformed into a soldier's creed. It may also be that a civilian government, perhaps incapable of fulfilling their responsibility towards the state, is swiftly replaced by a military authority. In other words, the last line of defence for the nation simply fulfils its purpose. It could just be that the state, placing their trust on their military, has granted it exceptional use of imperium over a given territory for a variety of reasons. It can be temporary or indefinite, but the homage owed to the men at arms is indisputable.\n\nDo not confuse these moments with the dashing charisma of caudillos and other despots — this is not a one man job. What you are witnessing is the submission of the whole political system not to a generalissimo, but to the army as an institution. A guild with their own rules, their own society within society, their own symbols and stories. Whether through juntas or through a single dictator, this is the fulfilment of the natural prerogative of the warrior to lord over the clerks and merchants by the virtue of their caste."
constitutional_monarchy:0 "Constitutional Monarchy"
constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "If we consider history as a linear progression, we can see a clear view of the evolution of political institutions. From the god-kings of antiquity to Roman oligarchy, passing through feudal vassalage and enlightened absolutism, we reach the zenith, the climax, the height of perfect rulership in the modern world: the Constitutional Monarchy.\n\nAlso ambiguously called "parliamentary" or "democratic," this form of monarchy is a testament to the indisputable triumphs of liberalism understood in its widest definition. It represents an overcoming of the antiquated despotisms that dominated Ancien Régime Europe and much of Asia up until the 19th century — oppressive anachronisms that wouldn't and couldn't recognise the new era approaching: that of efficiency, moderation, long-term continuity, and professionalism. Yet it acknowledges the horror of tyrannies of the majority, of excessive republicanism, of rabble-rousing populists unable to understand the subtle limitations of democracy and enthroning it in its most savage ugliness. It uses both written and traditional constitutions, as well as representative democracy, as the trustworthy allies of savvy politicians who must work within the respect of individual freedom to achieve the reforms needed to prosper. Like de Tocqueville, Constant, and Locke foresaw, civil society can only exist in a healthy mixture of limitations and liberty, giving a voice to the people but never letting their worst impulses take control, keeping the kings and queens as warrants of liberty rather than threats to it. It has triumphed in the United Kingdom, Italy, and the Netherlands among others, and even westernizing nations elsewhere have recognised its strengths as the only path towards a safe and free future that doesn't wait for anyone.\n\nElsewhere, however, the tale isn't as sweet, and the democratic limitations placed on monarchs aren't a frame to exercise power but a prison that ambitious royals strive to break and escape from by any means necessary. And yet, isn't this proof of its versatility as a tool? Isn't the sound of oppressors gnashing their teeth a sign that it works? Without naivete, common-sense and rationality march across time incarnate in constitutional monarchs, to the horror of radicals of all camps!"
personalist_dictatorship:0 "Personalist Dictatorship"
personalist_dictatorship_desc:0 "Power is a complex, brittle, appealing thing. The ambition and corruption of men have provoked that thus, power is organised and ordered according to a variety of principles such as inheritance, religious authority, military command, or the people's democratically elected representatives. In truth, this is just a mirage. Power is destined for those who dare conquer it.\n\nGerman sociologist Max Weber, in his dissection and analysis of the sources of power in society, saw that in certain cases there existed what he called a "charismatic authority," as opposed to legal authority and traditional authority. In these situations, much like for Archaic Greek tyrants, power is not owed thanks to due political process, but to the perceived or real unique attributes of a leader who goes on to take the reins through exceptional means. The way such a headman exerts his authority is rarely through the trust and codes of formal institutions, but rather they make use of the loyalty that they inspire in their followers, whether because of love or because of fear. This strictly personal conception of fealty between masters and subordinates is why regimes like these are denominated Personalist Dictatorships. Such phenomenon is universal and found all across the globe, although due to their strange births these forms of government rarely last for long.\n\nPersonalistic dictators are nearly always eclectic and their rule convoluted, with a scarcely consistent ideology accompanying a strong cult of the leader. In its synergy lies its best qualities, however, and they are highly adaptable and pragmatic regimes able to rise to changing internal and external challenges in the blink of an eye. Its most obvious downside is that men who take power in such ways are susceptible to vices and untold luxury, because as Lord Acton wrote, "absolute power corrupts absolutely," and earthly pleasures provide excellent distractions from efficient statesmanship."
revolutionary_nationalism:0 "Revolutionary Nationalism"
revolutionary_nationalism_desc:0 "The years of bloodletting and revanchist disappointments of the Great War bred radical political responses. Some, like the German model of socialism or the crystallization of the Polish and Fiuman regimes into accelerationism, sent shockwaves through the ideological sphere. But not every reaction would make it to the end of the decade with a host of converts and imitators. Before Accelerationism was an official label, other syncretic nationalist movements rose and fell in the 20s — most dramatically in Italy. Situated between the rejuvenationists and reactionaries, and without a core tendency to unite them, these groups and their followers are collected under the name Revolutionary Nationalism.\n\nDespite the failure of the Italian example, the attempt to bring romantic nationalists, anti-parliamentarians, and dissident socialists — even futurists — into one camp has been instructive. The political tensions in Europe before the Great War, followed by five years of disaster that seemingly satisfied nobody, led to a number of dramatic rejections of the liberal parliamentary status quo. Even in Red Germany, the eastern soldier councils proved this rejection could include bellicose, nationalistic sentiments — led by men who were ready to overthrow the Kaiser to reinvigorate Germany.\n\nBut what tenets constitute Revolutionary Nationalism? In some respects, its groups are defined by what they are not, an illiberal vanguardism that is not as disdainful of modernity as the reactionaries, nor as anti-traditional as the common accelerationists. Rejecting parliamentary politics as too corrupt to answer to the public and too divided to have clear vision, they produce an authoritarian government by design, capable of taking decisive action to reshape the country. Though their economic orthodoxy varies, they favour state intervention or coordination in the economy for the national interest and stability, such as corporatism. It remains to be seen what the fate of these political outsiders will be: though Fiume became a cause célèbre of the revolutionary far right, the men who were left behind are still awaiting their turn to shake the world."
aristocratic_reaction:0 "Aristocratic Reaction"
aristocratic_reaction_desc:0 "Civilization's long march brought about more sophisticated forms of stratification. Upper castes of martial strength were joined by those of knowledge and stature, justified by divinity or breeding. The notion that the masses should steer the state was solely the provenance of heretics and brigands — a perspective that largely endured until the late Enlightenment.\n\nAlas, man's appetite grows to match what he consumes. In what was the blink of an eye in historical terms, populism and the specter of egalitarianism upended this social order. Now, astride the ocean of blood spilled for such ideals, there is the uprising against the errors of modernity: rather than meek acceptance of a throne, the active counterargument of Aristocratic Reaction.\n\nUnderpinning this tendency is recognition of the inequality of man and an understanding of its consequences. Where can the politics of the mob lead but the Great War and the Revolutions of 1919? What does representative democracy privilege if not beguiling and planning that only extends to the next election? Accordingly, they prescribe an elitist regime, court politics conducted by an aristocracy prepared to rule, to lead and protect their subjects. The involvement of the public is accordingly limited to officially sanctioned channels — the festival, or the pogrom — and suppressed elsewhere.\n\nAristocratic Reaction represents an old ethos meeting modern problems. A world after the guillotine, industrialization, and levée en masse has broken with the past, but the past can be reconnected forward through the creation of more durable traditions. For instance, what this model rests on is not necessarily an aristocracy of unbroken lineage to past kings, but traits of nobility such as culture, faith, and blood. Additionally, despite the aversion to hallmarks of the French Revolution, the necessity of national defense still tends to produce centralized states rather than feudal ones. And of course, the unwashed masses must come to understand the appeal of this ideology again after such a long dormancy. So it approaches on horseback, promising an end to the disintegration of your world, and a return to principles once recognized as natural."
