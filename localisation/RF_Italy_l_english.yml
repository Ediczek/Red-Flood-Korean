ITALIAN_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "이탈리아 왕국은 아마 대전에서의 가장 위대한 승리자일 것입니다. 그러나 그 이득은 많은 대가를 치르고 얻은 것이었습니다. 제국은 지나치게 팽창하였으며, 경제는 멈춰섰고, 군은 20년 동안 침체되었습니다. 그럼에도 집권당인 이탈리아 통합민주당의 힘은 이탈리아를 유럽 자유주의의 유일한 보루로 만들었습니다. 그게 얼마나 오래 갈 수 있을까요?"

italy.1.d:0 "이탈리아 왕국의 수상이자 통합민주당 좌파계의 비공식 지도자인 이바노에 보노미는 포폴로 광장으로 밀려드는 군중을 물끄러미 바라보았습니다. 그는 에스프레소를 길게 한 모금 마시고는 재빨리 앞에 있는 신문지 위로 시선을 휙 돌렸습니다. 이번 주에는 많은 정치 사설들이 있었는데, 주로 스투르초와 당 우익계에 대한 다가오는 권력 이양과 관련된 것입니다. 책을 읽으면서 그는 뚜렷한 이유도 없이 자신이 점점 불안해하는 것을 느꼈습니다. 오늘 그에게 무슨 문제가 있었을까요?\n\n그는 키지궁으로 걸어 돌아가면서 점차 이해하게 되었습니다. 많은 이탈리아인들이 거의 15년간 이탈리아 통합민주당의 통치를 받아들이고 지지하도록 만든 단어 때문이었습니다.\n\n\“민주주의\”.\n\n처음부터 그가 졸리티 또는 스투르초와 나누었던 신뢰는 그 말 때문이었습니다. 수많은 이탈리아인들을 투표소로 불러들여 신당에 투표하게 한 말이었습니다. 급진당의 별똥별과 같은 부상을 부채질하고, 사회당을 돌이킬 수 없을 정도로 분열시키고, 인민당을 요람에서 목졸라 죽인 것도 그 말이었습니다. 이제 이 말, 이 생각을 할 때마다 근질거리기 시작했고 결국 그 개념을 소중하게 여기는 사람의 양심을 찢기 시작했습니다.\n\n이것이 정말 그가 바라던 것일까요? 통합민주당은 극단주의의 공격에 맞서 만들어진 연합 전선이지만, 자유주의 정당이 가질 수 있는 최악의 결과만을 모아 만들어졌습니다. 부패, 연고주의, 이기적인 조작-- 이것이 통합민주당에서 가장 기본이 되었습니다. 그러나 더 나쁘게도, 통합민주당은 가능한 한 가장 넓은 방법으로 이탈리아 민주주의의 겉부분을 차지함으로써 정치적으로 독점을 하게 되었고, 자유를 외면하는 세계에서 이탈리아 국민들에게는 유일하게 안전한 선택이 되었습니다.\n\n그는 사무실에 있는 의자에 앉아 잠긴 서랍에서 개인 일기를 꺼냈습니다. 많은 자기 분석 후에, 그는 가장 좋아하는 펜을 들고는 다음과 같은 말을 적기 시작했습니다:"
italy.1.a:0 "우리 모두는 이탈리아 민주주의의 안전을 위해 희생을 감수해야 한다."
italy.1.b:0 "그러나 그 과정에서 우리는 가장 중요한 것을 포기해서는 안 된다."

italy.2.t:0 "PDIU가 1936년 선거에서 승리하다"
italy.2.d:0 "In an event which has surprised essentially no one, the PDIU  has won the 1936 Italian General Election, resulting in Luigi Sturzo taking control of the party from Ivanoe Bonomi. Celebrations in the streets of Italy have been noticeable, but mild. It is after all, hardly a significant nudge of the status-quo. However, the Italian nation and the Italian people are always happy to be reminded that they are one of the last bastions of freedom within a twisted world of Despots, Futurists and Councilists following the deathly trials of the Great War. \n\nThe coalition party that is the  Partito Unito Democratico Italiano was formed not long after the end of the Great War in response to rising activities from the radical Right and Left, such as the Blackshirts championed by Benito Mussolini as well as Communist militias. A unified big-tent, democratic bloc can easily be said to have saved Italy from the dangers of radicals and extremists. A state of affairs which the Italian people have been very comfortable with to say the least. \n\nThe monopoly of the PDIU has been for many years without competition due to the big-tent nature of the party. It is after all, hard for radicals or opposition members to take charge when moderate factions are united. PDIU's hegemony was shaken a little with the death of Giovanni Giolloti in 1928, who was the undisputed hegemon of Italian politics. Away from the public eye, corruption slowly grows within the party and the messy response to the Slump has not been kind to the governing bodies of Italy either. No matter the case, the popular will of the Italian people, even if they do not have all the facts in front of them, has been made clear and it certainly seems that PDIU is here to stay."
italy.2.a:0 "Italy lives!"

italy.3.t:0 "변혁"
italy.3.d:0 "Following the announcement of the results of the 1936 Italian General election, there has been ecstatic celebration from more liberal and conservative government officials in the PDIU. Although the victory was hardly a surprise as essentially everyone had predicted a victory for the PDIU, but a shift to power no matter how expected is always welcome. As a result, Sturzo held a speech in Rome earlier today, addressing a modestly sized crowd of his plans for Italy to escape the slump so that “Italy may be reborn as the star of Europe, burning as bright as the sun!” Curiously Bonomi was notably absent from the podiums around the area where the speech was held, even though other members of the leftist factions of the PDIU were also present. Whatever the reason behind the disappearance of Bonomi, the speech was still well received and it is clear that the people of Italy have a bright future waiting for them."
italy.3.a:0 "Cheers to the Sturzo!"

italy.4.t:0 "보노미의 연설"
italy.4.d:0 "Bonomi stood facing the parliament. Making this speech was a tough decision to make, but he believes it is necessary not only to clear his conscience, but to potentially save Italy from becoming yet another tyrannical regime. He took a deep breath, and began speaking:\n\n\"Ever since the end of the Risorgimento and the dawn of the 20th Century. The Italian nation has been the defining nation of the world. Not necessarily in our actions in a global sense, but certainly in our policies. The end of Great War, saw Europe falling into the clutches of radicals: reactionaries, councilists and accelerationists, but not us! We stand here today as a beacon of freedom and democracy, or at least so we thought...\n\nMy friends, for a party that calls itself democratic, the practices within it are disrespectful or even insulting to the term \"democracy\". For twelve years, this party hasn't lost a single election, not just because of our fervent opposition to radicals from left and right, but because of the wide range of people it appeals to. This party brings together political factions that would oppose each other if we were in let's say United Kingdom, or Sweden, or any other still functioning democracy. And with each victorious election comes the transformato, the prime ministers switch allegience between Sinistra and Destra back and forth so that each faction has majority when their turn comes.\n\nMany of you refuse to see this, but Italy has become a one-party state for the mere sake of anti-extremism. What has this achieved? It has only allowed for corruption and cronyism to grow. These reprehensible things are rife within the party, many among you are only interested in satisfying your insatiable thirst for power. How can there be someone looking at the hands of the ruling and safeguarding the interests of the minority in a country with no real opposition?\n\nBecause of these reasons, my friends, I declare that PDIU-Sinistra shall participate in the elections in earnest. We will no longer continue this power sharing arrangement.\"\n\nFollowing this speech, the entire Italian parliament was in an uproar. At first, more conservative members of the PDIU denounced Bonomi. Even some people on the left shouted him down. Eventually, the outrage spread across parliament, even the most cool headed individuals started shouting and heckling their peers. Some defended Bonomi, many others criticised him. What the full ramifications of this event will be, it is too early to tell, but it is certain that the situation does not look good for the PDIU."
italy.4.a:0 "누구에게도 좋을 것 같진 않군."

italy.5.t:0 "연정의 붕괴"
italy.5.d:0 "Chaos has erupted throughout every part of Italy today following Ivanoe Bonomi's speech in parliament where he outed the PDIU as undemocratic and corrupt. Many believe that was merely a pretext to refuse to cede power to Struzo. The immediate result of the speech was what anyone would have expected it to be. Shouting matches quickly started, with members of PDIU-Destra denouncing and demonising Bonomi, framing his actions as a betrayal of the PDIU and the italian democracy. Though a few hardline members of the left faction of the PDIU along with parties outside of the coalition have supported Bonomi's decision with varying motives and varying intensity.\n\nNot long after the speech, the party began to descend into utter chaos with many of its members declaring their departure from the coalition. Perhaps most notably, Luigi Sturzo himself has defected to Lista Nazionale. A controversial move, given that the party was founded by and composed of many former Fascists, most notably Italo Balbo. Similar defections have occured all across the PDIU as the party came crashing down like a house of cards. The more left-leaning members of PDIU have followed suit, with some joining the liberal Partito Radicale Italiano and others becoming part of the social democratic party.\n\nFor the first time since in more than a decade, political violence has erupted across the Italian nation. There have been reports of protests if not riots across the country. Street fights have become increasingly common with there even being reports of deaths resulting from clashes between political groups in hotspots of political extremism. Most notably in the city of Milan, where a gunfight that broke out resulted in the deaths of 10 people.  Anarchist and Syndicalist forces have also exploited the situation, organising strikes and marches across the country to make the most of a situation ripe with opportunity for spreading support for leftist movements.\n\nWith such radical changes swiftly taking hold of the Italian nation uncertainty is spreading, and many look on in fear at what the future may bring."

The monopoly of power held by the PDIU seemed so unshakeable that some had remarked that the PDIU could never be overthrown, describing it as the “Leviathan” of Italian politics. And ironically, this statement was proven to be true. Indeed no outside force would have been capable of overthrowing the PDIU. Only the PDIU itself could manage such a thing, and following Bonomi's decision to contest the election results and block Sturzo from gaining control of the PDIU, that is exactly what it did.\n\nThe PDIU exploded from the resulting political chaos, many of its members joined other (generally more radical) parties. An additional consequence has been that many previously minor parties have seized the moment to gain popularity among the Italian population, some parading and demonstrating for their cause, others launching campaigns to boost support. The most notable of these parties are Partito Radicale Italiano led by Francesco Nitti and  Lista Nazionale, to which Luigi Sturzo has defected to. \n\nFrancesco Saverio Nitti, the old stalwart of radical liberalism, has seen growing popularity for his pledges to proactively fix the economy by subsidizing individual farmers, centralizing the land sales, reforming currency and expanding the banking sector. PRI supports a wide range of social and economic reforms including improvement of the welfare system, industrializing italian territories in Africa and expanded rights for women. Perhaps the most ambitious plan is to crack down on the corruption festering in Italy and thus, help bring about a prosperous Italian south, on par with the economic giants that are cities like Milan, Florence or Rome. Moreover, Francesco also aims at regimenting the armed forces by developing the industrial complex, pulling the army round and coordinating all branches of italian military. \n\nLuigi Struzo on the other hand, still has support from former Conservatives who had been radicalised by the destruction of the PDIU, as well as some single issue voters who tend to be composed of the more religious members of society. Sturzo claims to have reinvented his policies which now include plans to implement a socialized economy with strong emphasis on traditional catholic values. Lista Nazionale has also highlighted their aim to brutally crack down on what has been dubbed “The Three Plagues” Separatism, Corruption and Illegalism. The LN has also promised to rebuild the Italian economy and utilise the riches of the colonial empire to elevate Italy to new heights. \n\nThe fact that this election is essentially the first contested election in Italian politics in many decades has led to massive amounts of political polarisation within the country. As the Italian nation stands at a fork in the road, it's people can only wait and see what the future holds."

Peace was worth a try, or so they said. So much time, so many resources, so much blood, all wasted. Yet he had to follow orders. He let out a groan and proceeded to carefully read the draft Rome sent. He was not a diplomatic man, but Graziani was not completely sure some vague promises of autonomy for the Libyans would be enough to convince the so-called Matari of Mnifa to simply lie down his arms and peacefully surrender. He carefully paced his office, looking out the window that directly faced the indomitable arid wasteland beyond the Green Mountain. Somewhere out there, a secret army of hundreds of thousands patiently waited for him to make a mistake. They would tear him and his army piece by piece like rabid dogs at any chance they may get, and the Governor doubted a simple bone would be enough to keep these beasts satiated."

He carefully tied his officer's sabre around his waist and put on his military cap, looking at himself in the mirror. This meeting deserved some ceremony and reflection. The Matari had been a great adversary and had fought valiantly. For years, they had duelled swiftly and masterfully, manoeuvring each other into ambushes and traps using perfectly calculated tactics. Mukhtar had made him double-guess himself at every turn, move carefully and plan every single movement. And now Graziani had won. Yet, he felt empty. It was barely a surrender. There was no great battle, no final face-off, no honour in this peace. As he stepped out of the ruined manor he had been using as base of operations, he finally saw him. His figure, with clothes and beard as white as marble, was mesmerizing, carrying himself with humility and dignity. Mukhtar stepped down from his purebred horse, and without moving his gaze away from the Italian's eyes, extended a firm hand. Graziani and the Lion shook hands.\n“You have been a valiant enemy.”\n“War is war,” the sheikh answered stoically."

On top of a small wooden platform, the old teacher himself gestured for the tattle to quiet down and rose from his seat to speak to the crowd. The warriors quickly silenced themselves and each other to listen to the Lion.\n“We have fought proudly and honourably, and this is what we have to show for it,” Mukhtar proclaimed, holding the letter for all to see, “but this is not victory. It is, however, a proof that we are slowly bleeding them out. We must still fight, until the very last drop of blood. We are the men of the hills and the desert, brave as lions. Even the men of the cities have forsaken us, and thus we must not forget we are alone in this war. We achieve martyrdom or glory. I advise you to prepare for the many battles to come. May Allah protect you.”\nDespite Omar al-Mukhtar's calm and mellow voice, the Libyans erupted into loud and chaotic cheers for their old chieftain, then dispersed along the duar to prepare their weapons, their morale in an all-time high. Italian blood would sluice the mountains and valleys just as much as Senusi blood."

The formed Italian delegation was not delighted with its assignment, despite the importance of its task. France has been in a state of post-war confusion for several years now, shaking from constant coups, but who knows, maybe the current government will show miracles of pliability? On the other hand, what will happen if French will reject the offer?... However, the meeting is scheduled at the Vieille Charité - a luxurious almshouse, which is located in the equally beautiful Marseille. It's unlikely that the French would choose such a wonderful place if they just wanted to refuse the offer, right? The ambassadors reached the meeting place by sea, leaving Livorno. The good sunny weather brightened up the trip, and many delegates had a, perhaps even naive, confidence of success. However, world was torn apart by Grande Guerra. The world in which there is little to be truly sure of... \nArrived in Vieille Charité, the officials didn't recognized the place. Judging by old photographs and paintings, it definitely looked different before. Back in a day, it looked definitely better. The delegation was met by people in theatrical masks. The French clearly want to impress their guests! Heading to the entrance to the building, the diplomats were greeted by an alley of grotesque and eerie sculptures: some of them took bizarre, alien forms, which replace clear angularity with arbitrary curves; some were scenes of torture and murder, including those involving animals. Some of the ambassadors joked about the strange taste and desire of the locals to shock the guests. Entering the spacious hall of the almshouse, a group of Frenchmen was sitting at a large table and discussing something loudly and laughing, at first ignoring those who entered. The diplomats themselves did not immediately realize that they would have to communicate with this eccentric group. The attendants seated the ambassadors in their places at the table, but away from the receiving party. The head of the delegation, after a short mutual greeting, outlined the purpose of his visit and began to convince the French of the need to legally consolidate the guarantees of peace between two states.From the hitherto the smile on the faces of the French, shining with joy, disappeared. After a short conversation with each other, which was accompanied by smirks in the direction of those who came, one of them, a stocky Frenchman with a piercing gaze, stood up and burst into a tirade: \n\"If you are really asking us what you talked about ... then we are discouraged. By Le Patron, is THIS you want from us?! This is awkward! You know, we're the people of art, we are driven by emotions, feelings that, being a projection of Le Patron, tells us - agreements with democratic pigs are just wasting our time! Don't you understand the futility of your efforts? Don't you understand that your system of values will soon cease to exist?! We are futurists, we are the POWER that changes the world! Your society is stuck in the past and it is our duty to sooner or later crush you like insects, leaving no trace of you! Now go home, close your doors and gag on pasta tirelessly, knowing that someday we will come for your wives and raze you to the ground!\" \nThe Frenchman's face turned red with tension, he sat down and began to catch his breath, while the faces of those who until recently naively believed in the success of the meeting, froze in horror. Another Frenchman, in a cold voice, recommended leaving immediately, giving the ambassadors five minutes. Three of which have already passed, he said."

The building itself was rather simple and plain, built by architects that favored sustainability and efficiency rather than beauty. As soon as his chauffeur stopped the car in front of the plaza and he walked out of the car and into the plaza, Badogilo was greeted by the staff of this building, who then ushered him into the structure. The staff gave him a brief tour of the building, designating him where everything was at: the kitchen, washrooms and bathing centers, the sleeping quarters, everything to ensure that one could live in relative comfort here.\nOnce the tour ended, the staff finally guided him to one final room: a large room with a panel roof. In the room were numerous desks and tables, most covered in large boxes containing a forest’s worth of paper and files, others were covered in maps of various areas of the world and had small figures dotted on them. The only clear table was in the center, one that would be used for meetings.\nAround said table stood the finest military minds Italy could offer, Badoglio included. They were all here due to a single order by Ill Duce Balbo: To devise new and infallible warplans that are to be used in Italy’s future wars of conquest and bring glory to the peninsula and the government that rules it.\nThere was a pregnant silence in the air for a few moments, then Marshal De Bono spoke up."

The Perfidious Albion has seen through our plans and The Regia Marina has failed miserably, Operation Quartenion is called off!\n\nRegardless of the most excellent warplanning skills of our military high command, our forces have been quickly discovered and even more rapidly encountered and defeated: our most recent reports describe Operation Quartenion as a total failure that we’ve paid for with a very high number of casualties compared to the one suffered by the British forces; our agents have failed miserably in their intents to destabilize albionic control over our desired targets: not only we’ve failed to inspire the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots to rise up against one another but we’ve also failed in doing the same with Gibraltar’s local population, all of this without even mentioning the complete inability of our men during our direct confrontation with the british’s garrison divisions.\n\nItalo Balbo sits in his office, dressed with his military uniform, with the uncontrollable desire to open his new pack of cigars, light up the best looking one out of the bunch and smoke the entire goddamn thing out of pure frustration: he just couldn’t believe it, he just couldn’t entirely swallow the fact that the very plan he planned for weeks, no, months had proved to be an utter disgrace to the sheer prestige and reputation of the Italian nation, of its military, of its credibility on the world stage and, most importantly, of its leadership. \nMost of Italy’s past leadership would have panicked at such an outstanding bellic failure, not because of their love and dedication to their fatherland of course, but because they would have feared that that moment would have signified the true end of their plutodemocratic mandate as prime ministers or whatever, so they would have cared about restoring their reputation first, putting their personal interests before those of Italia and their sons. \n\nBut, luckily for Italy, Italo Balbo was no comfy-armchair politician: he didn’t need to gather his sources of support, may it be the people or the decadent parliamentarians at Palazzo Montecitorio or at Palazzo Madama, to confirm his rule not only because  he truly had Italy’s well-being at heart but also because he simply had full control on the Kingdom, as his presence was either loved by every good-mannered patriot or  deeply feared by closeted liberals or even worse, by pestiferous bolsheviks or crypto-bolsheviks that he knew, despite his best efforts, still lingered around the nation somewhere. \nBut they were completely harmless at the moment, Italo was undoubtedly sure of it. \n\nHe then jumped from his seat and exited his office in fulminous fashion, ready to prepare his next war plan or executive order to gift to his country: because afterall…."

Trade and Commerce were the true foundation of Venice’s power but they also were the biggest factors that led to their ultimate downfall: Soon the leadership of the Republic fell to the hands of disgustingly irresponsable and outrageous Elites who, like Italy’s plutodemocratic governments after the great war, led their nation down to an endless spiral of decadence and decay. \n\nOf course, this won’t happen under our watchful eye. \n\nWe’ll honour Venice’s great men while also proving wrong those who were responsible for the fall of the Serenissima."

Now he straightened his coat as he prepared to explain for the first time the details of his platform to the Italian people.\n\n“My fellow citizens-- today I am proud to say that the government of this kingdom has approved my 15 point plan to secure the future of the country. I realize that the details have been left a bit vague, and I apologize: let me run through some of the points now. \n\nFirst, we must have civil peace and order. This is the first duty of every government. Therefore we will promote measures to bring about peace both here in Italy proper and in our overseas territories. After that, we can begin an aggressive plan of economic revitalization, starting with agriculture and finance. Using that as a foundation we can then fight unemployment through expansion of public works and the armaments sector, while fighting poverty through welfare reform, and finally bringing the South up to parity with the North. Once the mainland is dealt with, unemployment will be further reduced by significant military and civil projects in our overseas territories, capping things off with comprehensive military and administrative reforms overall. We will stop at nothing to bring the peoples of Italy to a future of liberty and prosperity!” \n\nAs he left, journalists began to pepper the Prime Minister with questions about particulars-- all except one, anyhow.

As he walked out of the Gialo safe zone, his heart began to beat frantically to the growing danger all around him. A lone, young Italian man walking into the desert armed with nothing but khaki shorts and an Arabic phrasebook? God only knew what the beduini would do to him once they caught him. He swallowed down his fear and reminded himself of his mission. He was not here to harm the locals, but to help. His studies had told him that charity was a pillar of Islam, hadn't they? He personally doubted that the Senussi tribesmen he was to meet were quite so pious. He checked his compass and map. This ridge was the site. Well, better to sit and wait out the inevitable. He slumped against his hiking pack, grateful for the chance to rest his legs. \n\nHis only warning was the slight rustle of sand crunching underfoot. He sprang up to see that he was surrounded (where the hell did they all come from?) by five hard-looking, well-armed Libyans. One stepped forward, and began in broken, stilted Italian: “What are you doing here, foreigner? You are no soldier. Do you not know that this land is protected by the Mujahid Omar al-Mukhtar? No Italian dogs are suffered to live here.” \n\nGianmario stood, and began in even more broken Arabic “I know, but I must be here nonetheless. I am Doctor Gianmario Carbone, and I am here with the Medical Peace Mission. I was ordered to offer my services free of charge to any and all Libyans who request them. Would you guide me to the nearest settlement? I would like to get to work as soon as possible.” \n\nAfter a thorough search of his bags, his captors (no, compatriots) returned to him. Their leader spoke again: “Very well, doctor. You may accompany us to camp. However, you will follow all of my instructions to the letter: one deviation from my commands and you will die. Understood?” \n\nHe nodded. \n\n“Good”. \n\nAs the party trudged away, Gianmario began, finally, to relax. He would live to see another day, at least. Who knows-- maybe, just maybe, he could really make a difference to these people."

Preliminaries were drawn up quickly and efficiently, aides on both sides managing to negotiate time and place for the official meeting with ease. Carlo Sforza rubbed his chin pensively as the car sped the last few hundred meters to the large tent that would serve as conference venue. Perhaps the Senussis were getting tired of this as well, after all. \n\nNo significant errors at the beginning, thank God. Sforza was grateful that Mukhtar was conducting the negotiations personally; that should remove a great deal of uncertainty. He moved with the sharp grace of an agitated predator, only showing a hint of unfamiliar awkwardness when he sat in a chair across from Sforza. He began to speak, the translator’s whispers laying over the guttural melody like oil poured over metal:\n\n“I have seen your initial conditions, but I wish to hear them one more time, now that we are conducting formal negotiations. Have any of your positions changed?” \n\n“No, general. All previously offered concessions and demands remain. All territories beyond the greater urban zones of the main coastal cities will be reorganized into an autonomous territory directed by the Senussi order. Italian land ownership in the Jabal will be restricted as you have requested, and full Italian citizenship with all the rights thereof will be immediately extended to any Libyan who requests it without preconditions. Libyans will be exempt from conscription if they do not take up citizenship and Libyan trade will be exempt from tariffs. \n\nIn return, the Senussi order will cease hostile activity against Italy, and a military exclusion zone of 200 kilometers from Italian territories will be put in force. Furthermore, the order will not object to the construction of roads, railroads and other infrastructure for our mutual benefit in the autonomous zone and allow the passage of our troops through their territory in time of war.” \n\nMukhtar nodded. “These terms are acceptable. Are they final?” \n\nSforza shook his head, grinning slightly. “Not quite.” \n\nMukhtar frowned. \nSforza quickly said “There are no extensions to the demands, general, I assure you. Merely a token of the government’s respect for your order and its traditions.” He removed a piece of paper from his briefcase. “I have been authorized to offer an annual sum of 1 million lire to your order for the purpose of funding and improving the zawiyat in your territories.

We won’t. Part of our mission is to support education, and if that happens to coincide with you not killing our people, then the next step is obvious.”\n\nMukhtar regained control of himself, but only for a moment; his mask of determination cracking into a broad smile.

They are no longer mere peasants, but citizens, educated and conscious.

I’ll show you how we’ll fucking deal with them!” he picked up a large stick from the ground and wrenched it, barely showing any effort as the wood strained, popped, and finally broke with a sound like a cannon going off. “I will break them, Ferruccio.

To the north, the Reds seek to dominate our lives in every detail, setting individuals against each other on a class basis in order to better exercise their tyranny over all. To the east, the Balkan nations gaze hungrily on our Adriatic lands, the Turks grasp at the federal state of Anatolia, and the crowned heads of various countries conspire to place our free citizens of Eritrea and Somalia under their despotism. I could go on.” \n\nAs he spoke, he seemed to transform before the eyes of the crowd. Gone was the reassuring calmness of the relaxed man that they had elected. In his place stood a man of fire, of iron determination and uncompromising certainty. He continued:\n\n“We have already realised almost all of our 15 points, even the ones that seemed unthinkable when we were elected: the universal vote, the republic, the creation of our great federation. But what about the last one? "We will fight for liberty, justice and democracy in Italy." Why should that only extend to Italy? Are we so miserly with our principles, so servile in our desire for peace today that we cannot fight for peace tomorrow? What good is it to stand by while Europe, Asia, Africa and more besides are plunged into terror and darkness? How long can we last alone in such a case? We cannot, and so we must act. Now. Not only for ourselves, but our children, and the children of the world-” \n\nHe stopped, overcome with emotion, breathing hard. When he looked up, the mask of many years of public life had fallen. Finally, the Italians could clearly see the man they had chosen to lead them."

Brutally emasculated by defeat after defeat, by a slavish attachment to peace and civil order, we liberals have failed. We have all failed, and look at the consequences! Fucking madmen squatting in Paris, violating our great city, the beating heart of the Revolution! Damned commies tread on the bones of Frederick, Goethe, Blum, and the heroes of Frankfurt! Everywhere liberty is outraged, equality is perverted, fraternity is despised. This will not stand!” \n\n“No more hand-wringing! No more cowardice from the virtuous! This great federation, this glorious republic, this triumph of moral and material progress, must take up that great burden of liberation that so many others have borne. This time there is no traitorous emperor to kill our republic in the cradle, no unholy compact of crowns to prune the tree of liberty before it can take root. The Italian Republic, clothed in the hopes of millions and armored by the spirits of of our forebears and the Genius of Liberty herself, will purge Europe’s darkness forever. Avanti Libertà! Avanti La Repubblica!” \n\nThe crowd stared, open-mouthed, utterly silent. Just as the moment was beginning to collapse, a young man in the back shouted “Death to all tyrants! To Paris! To Berlin! Hang them all! No mercy!” Suddenly, the crowd shifted, its mood changed as if by magic. All the years of fear and uncertainty, all the sadness at the fate of Italy’s neighbors and the future of Europe, was transmuted in an instant to white-hot rage. The crowd took up the young man’s cry, and the journalists present carried that fury back to their papers. \n\nOver the next days the outrage spread like fire over an oil slick, until the whole country from Turin to Libreville and from Palermo to Mogadishu seemed to boil with fury and the promise of destruction.

Francesco Saverio Nitti walked through the outskirts of the reconstruction zone of the Kiel canal, breathing in the scents of diesel exhaust, motor oil, and freshly turned earth. The work was proceeding excellently; the German engineers were every bit as good as they claimed, and the laborers, grateful for the steady, well-paying job, were diligent and effective. It should only be another two weeks before it reopened, bringing a significant increase in trade to the areas of Europe that needed it most. \n\nSo much had been lost in the past few years. Nitti did not regret his choices-- he could never regret setting men free-- but he wished every day that the cost could have been lower. Europe’s total combined output had shrunk by almost a third, and though it was now rebounding, the scars would remain for many years. Priceless monuments were destroyed, cultural artifacts lost, and most of all, the nations of Europe had lost their dignity and sense of purpose. He hoped it would all be worth it. He really thought it would be, but looking out at this destruction, unleashed at his orders, it was hard to be sure.\n\nA German engineer jogged up to him, saluting sloppily. “Sir, progress is excellent. We may actually be ahead of schedule slightly- can’t promise anything, but it’s going well.” \n\nNitti smiled wanly. He turned to the young man, a mask of seriousness forming on his face. “What is your name?”\n\n“Castorp, sir. Hermann Castorp.”\n\n“Herr Castorp, then. Well Herr Castorp, I promise you this: we will bring back all that was lost. If we can’t, we will build something better in its place.” He looked out at the canal. “This is just the beginning. I swear that every drop of blood, every tear, every moment of sadness will be paid back tenfold with prosperity and joy.” He looked back at the engineer, and was astonished. The man was smiling gently, as if to a small child. “We know you will, sir. We know. We wouldn’t be here breaking our backs if we didn’t believe that.”\n\nAs the young man left, Nitti stood there, watching the bulldozers and backhoes at work. He was having a little trouble seeing; maybe a fog had come in off the Baltic. He sighed shakily, and relief flowed through him like the tide. The engineer, with that simple comment, had wiped away years of doubts and self-loathing. He continued to stare, spellbound, at the great work of rebuilding before him. It really was all worth it, after all. It really was."

Sensing this danger, the French government has offered us rather generous terms of surrender. They will recognize our possession of the territories of the Regency of Carnaro, and cede to us both Alta Savoia and Tunisia, and in exchange we will demand no indemnities and vacate the rest of their lands. Furthermore, the Escadron will offer a 210-gun salute to the Italian flag, and the King will be given three works of art of his choice from the Louvre. \n\nThough we will not have the satisfaction of marching into Paris just now, there is no doubt that this is a great victory. D’Annunzio’s little bandit kingdom is crushed, France is humiliated and Italy’s reputation as a Great Power is now unquestionable. We have some hard work ahead of us, to be sure; the Carnaro must be properly integrated into the nation along with the new territories, our armed forces must be re-equipped, and we must digest the lessons of this mercifully short war.

Its integration into the Italian Federation is a victory for natural law and human rights all across Europe.\n\nIrrespective of this, the Greeks are a proud and petty people. For centuries they were shackled under Ottoman rule, and this resentment towards foreign occupation is apparent as the local Greeks are antagonistic to the arrival of Italian. While current relations with the local population are mostly nonviolent, with reports of Italian soldiers playing with Greek schoolchildren, repressed tension is in the air and everyone can smell it as nationalist agitation enters its preliminary formations.\n\nDespite this, there are still some Greeks, Greeks with a romanticized view of the Byzantine and Roman period, who hail the oncoming Italian troops as a revival of the glory periods of the Greeks under the crown of the Byzantines and Romans. They, of course. are in the minority, as the Roman identity which Greeks used to hold is long gone, but their rhetoric holds the potential to inspire many to the cause of natural law, even if it is for reasons contrary to liberal rhetoric."

As he cleaned himself off, every spectator could clearly see what had hit him. It was shit. Some joker had thrown shit at the officer. Andon got ready to run-- no way were the Italians going to take this lying down. People were going to die today, all because some moron thought he would be funny. \n\nTo his surprise, the officer straightened, threw away his filthy handkerchief, and gave the order to keep marching.

After so many years of painful struggle, heartbreaking defeats and anxious crises, Russia was finally united and free. Vasily Maklakov and Pavel Milyukov separated, ready to get down to business.\nThough technically this was a negotiation between separate nations, the two Russians absolutely agreed on the major point: immediate reunification of the country. This meeting was really about explaining the new European system to Milyukov, and securing his blessing for Italy’s temporary status as protector of Russia while it was reunified and reconstructed. As they ironed out the particulars of reunification, they invited Sforza to sit with them. \nHe began to explain, for the umpteenth time, Italy’s position. “Signore Milyukov, I assure you that Italy has no desire to institute a system of protectorate nations, despite what you may have heard. The fact is that the federation has suffered mightily to liberate many nations, and thus we ask a rather modest price for our efforts. Italy requests most favored nation status for trade in Russia for three years, after which Russia will be accepted without delay into the European economic agreement we intend to create. Between now and then you may make other agreements as you please.”\n“Furthermore, Russia will be obliged to keep a standing army of sufficient size to both defend itself and assist sister republics as the need should arise, with supreme allied command being held by an Italian officer for another year. By that point we should all be working closely enough that a supreme commander will no longer be necessary or could be chosen by the sister republics in concert. Finally, you must swear to maintain exclusivity of alliance with Italy and the other recognized sister republics, and sign a permanent treaty of non-aggression and cooperation with all of them. Are these terms acceptable?”\nMilyukov sniffed. The terms were acceptable, even desirable in the short term-- he and his colleagues had a lot of damage to fix. Nevertheless it was still a bit galling for Russia to be dictated to so bluntly by such an upstart power. Milyukov smiled tightly. “I certainly accept. We do owe you much, though I hope that in future talks we can negotiate on a more… level basis?”\nSforza nodded his understanding. “Certainly, sir, and we will. This is a revolutionary period, and such times are always full of danger, as you well know. However, as things begin to settle down, I assure you that we will be true to our word, and will grant you the full dignity you deserve.” He stood. “If there is nothing more gentlemen, I will take my leave.”\nMilyukov rose, walked over and clasped him in a hug, surprisingly strong for his age. “Thank you,” Milyukov whispered. “You have given us so much. We will never forget it.”"

ITA_southern_industries:0 "Southern Core Industries"
ITA_southern_industries_desc:0 "In order to achieve parity, we can’t just build a bunch of luxury goods factories in the south and call it good. Industrial capacity and know-how must be spread throughout the country in order to prevent further concentration.

ITA_producing_export:0 "Producing for Export"

ITA_carriers_and_battleships_desc:0 "Though the battleship is waning, it is not quite dead yet. Even a carrier-centric navy must have significant surface support, and other applications like shore bombardment will keep battleships close to the heart of our doctrine.

Could you imagine!? The soul of Europe would not survive another such trial, and we, as its originators, would be damned in turn,\" spoke the Secretary for State, his brow furrowed.\n\n\"Many men would not survive another such trial, either!\" exclaimed the Foreign Minister. \"An intervention in Italy would be war, and then all of Europe would be in danger. And do you not think that after Italy, the Dutch would follow the next day, and the Germans the day after? The dead would fill the Rhine on the back of our bloodthirst. If the Italians want peace, then they shall have it!\"\n\n\"The nation is simply not ready for war. Not ours, and not the Italians' either,\" chimed in the Minister for War. \"Were we to stand by Italy, there would be French troops in Calais by nightfall. Shipping in the Channel and the Mediterranean would be in grave danger, the Empire would be choked, and the fleets are not yet arranged to protect them. Arditi would be in Venice, and raiders would be torpedoing ships off Sicily, before we could land a single army on the Italian peninsula.\"\n\n"Our intervention would destroy not just peace, but the international order across Europe. This business is between the Italians — it need not include us. The diplomatic game is a delicate one, after all,\" stated Lord Perth, smiling serenely. He had been whisked away from a round of golf to attend; his bright, multi-coloured Argyle sweater stuck out like a sore thumb amid the suits around him. \"Britannia may rule the waves, but she cannot waive the rules.\"\n\nA chorus of gentlemanly laughter broke out over the table; and with it, the fate of Italy was sealed."

Indeed, much of Italian society was no doubt panicking at the revelations from London. But here, in this humble newsagents in a humble Italian town, was an oasis of total calm. Massimo was a humble man, and so was his father before him; he had inherited his sense of total unflappability, too — watching him work through the darkest days of the Great War had taught the young man a valuable lesson. Unlike some, he knew that the Sun would rise tomorrow, just as it had this morning, and it would rise again the day after, and the day after that, and with the Sun would come townsfolk waiting to buy his newspapers; they needed to be sure that the Sun would rise once more, even if Massimo did not.\n\nCertainly, the news was not good for the nation. Britain abandoning their military commitments and years of vague promises to the Savoyard monarchy, all in exchange for a peace that everyone knew could not last, did not seem like pragmatic diplomacy, in spite of how many time the English diplomats stressed the phrase. Perhaps he would be called up to serve, perhaps not. It mattered little. The languid pace of provincial life had had its effects, too.\n\nArranging the crisp pages of the 'Corriere della Sera' on his shelves, next to the venerable 'La Stampa' and the incensed 'Idea Nazionale', Massimo smiled at a job well done. Today was going to be a good day, he said to himself, eyes lingering on the sensational headlines, no matter what came. And so it would go, day after day, until the sky caved in."
