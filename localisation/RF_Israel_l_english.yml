A manifesto, urging French Expatriates to reject the so-called "King in Syria" is circulating  in Lebanon. While in Damascus and other cities, protests are increasing in frequency and intensity."

His family was large, and his skills in selling - larger. He had seen everything up to this point, from Jewish travellers to Russian dockyard workers, and so didn’t fear one bit when the Zionist revolt occured. These people weren’t enough to cause trouble, no. Not in his beloved Al-Quds.\n\nRifaah al-Munir found himself being stomped on, his teeth falling into the dirt and his chest in severe pain. His mouth bled profusely and his bones crackled at the fierce feeling of the leather against his cheek - perhaps this wasn’t the time to be reflecting on the past.\n“Hem Hebri hu em sgulh...”\nThe men above him spoke a language he didn’t understand very well, even if it sounded a little similar to his native language. He felt the boots stomp on him harder. His weapon, which he used to fend off against the Zionist rebels, was a couple meters away from him, and he felt his heart ache. Next to him, he saw a man with pale complexion, blue eyes and curly hair. He wondered what he was doing on the ground.\n“Hi Rts-Yshrl bskhumih hmfurshim bsurh...”\nHe begged. He was trying to cry as his eyes only shed blood, and his consciousness slipped out of him. He saw the pale man be taken away, his screaming in a similar language to the one done by the speaker. His comrade in the ground being rudely taken upwards to a dirt wall next to the commotion.\n“S Rts-Yshrl khbsh yshrl Bkhrb.”\nAs Rifaah felt the boots break his skull even further, he saw his pale friend be dragged onto the wall and be tied up in some way. He continued watching, but his consciousness slipped away like the dirt in his face drenched itself in blood. He only could wonder what they were saying..."

ISR.2.t:0 "First Elections to the Knesset"
ISR.2.desc:0 "Now that the chaos of post-independence has been dealt with, the time has come for Israel’s first ever general election in order to select its first prime minister.\n\nThe immediate frontrunner is David Ben-Gurion representing the Mapai. The party rejects both the Marxism of Labour Unity and the nationalism of Revisionist Zionism. Although the party advocates for liberal democracy, they also emphasize the need for social programs and worker's rights in a uniquely Zionist conception of social democracy. Critics from both the right and left have called the Mapai a more moderate version of Poale Zion, and the radical socialist-zionists have decried the two working together in a potential coalition. But the magnetism of Ben-Gurion is a strong draw, and the moderate left have the easiest path to election victory. The Mapai has also refused to make statements on Palestine, stating that the needs of the Jewish people should be taken care of before the issue can even be discussed internally.\n\nThe primary opposition to Ben-Gurion is Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the Revisionist Zionists. This party believes in territorial maximalism for Israel, expansionism and militarism, and encouragement of immigration by non-Israeli Jews to the land of Israel. This militarist and right-wing form of Zionism means that the rights of Palestinians will be secondary to the creation of a Greater Israel. Jabotinsky’s connections with the British also means his party are pro-Commonwealth, and will seek the help of the British if needed.\n\nThe final group, which has the least amount of popular support, are the Labour Zionists. The two Socialist-Zionist parties, Labour Unity and Poale Zion both seek to establish a worker's state in the land of Israel, so that the Jewish proletariat can participate in the international class struggle, in much the same fashion as the Germans. The Labour Unity have also adopted a Marxist view of history and colonialism as part of their party platform, and are thus somewhat more willing to cooperate with the native Arab population, though not to the detriment of Israel. The Poale Zion however are more moderate, although the party advocates for socialism, and will cooperate with both the Mapai and Labour Unity, they believe the Mapai policies to be too soft and liberal, and the Labour Unity too radical, hampering their vote share. Any strongly leftist government will be a coalition of sorts, and the leadership question is hotly debated."

ISR.201.t:0 "Albert Einstein Invited to Lead Israel"
ISR.201.desc:0 "Israeli elections returned an inconclusive result, but internal negotiations among socialist-zionists returned only one name that both could agree on to lead the coalition - famed Jewish theoretical physicist Albert Einstein. Although currently living in Germany, Einstein has been vocal in his support of the fledgling state, and has shown support for socialist-zionism. Applauding the recent election victory and the defeat of the revisionist zionists.\n\nAfter some assurances from the parties wore through his humility, Einstein graciously accepted the proposal, a radio reading of his acceptance letter thanking the Israeli people for welcoming him with such enthusiasm was well received in Tel Aviv. The chief condition of Einstein’s premiership it seems, is socialist-zionist unity, he stated that Israel can never prosper while the left cannibalizes itself. The new coalition between Poale Zion and the Labour Zionists is now under pressure to cooperate, lest they fail Einstein. While radicals from both parties have objected, stating that neither the coalition nor its constituent parties will survive such a merger, the vast majority of both the people and party members have celebrated its founding."

ISR.3.t:0 "The Peel Commission"
ISR.3.desc:0 "In response to the unrest of April 1936, the British government established the Palestine Royal Commission, colloquially called the Peel Commission after its head, Lord Peel. After much deliberation and investigation into the exact cause of the protests, it was determined, in a truly inspirational and thorough analysis, that the unrest had been caused by “ethnic tension between Arabs, Jewish settlers, and British authorities”. Obvious conclusions aside, the resolution did kick off the process of finding a solution to said ethnic tensions, in the form of a new partition. Although neither side was particularly thrilled about this idea to begin with, particularly the more radical nationalists who had hoped for a completely independent Palestine, things really began to shift once it was announced that Jewish settlements, which up until now were spread thinly along the coastal west of the nation, would now make up a majority of the Northern plains of Palestine. While Arab groups are unanimously opposed to such a rapid expansion of Jewish settlement, the Jewish side of the argument is bitterly divided. For example, Labour Zionists, the Poale Zion under David Ben-Gurion, and most of the members of the Haganah are opposed to the partition, claiming that such a drastic overstep is a transparent and punishing response to the events of April 1936, and that punishment of all Arabs for the actions of a few protestors will only drive Arabs further into the arms of radical groups. Meanwhile,  the Irgun and Lehi see no issue with the partition, except for the most militant among them who say it does not go far enough in handing control of the Eretz Yisrael, or Land of Israel, to Jewish settlers.\n\nDespite their differences, however, the Irgun, Lehi, and Haganah have all taken quickly to the task of cooperation in the defense of Jewish settlements against a new wave of Palestinian backlash. But as they fight side by side and come into increasing contact with one another, the cracks in the alliance are beginning to show, with the more passionate of the three groups denouncing their rivals as “False Zionists”. As the unity between Jews collapses, Arab unity against colonization has increased exponentially, with Vanguardist rebels and traditionalist Muslim clerics agreeing to cease their infighting, at least for the duration of the coming conflict.\n\nThe whole colony is like a bundle of dynamite waiting to explode, and Peel just lit the fuse."

ISR.5.t:0 "A Schism in the Movement"
ISR.5.desc:0 "Now that Israel has won its independence and the ineffectual state of Mashriq has been dealt with forever, the Zionist movement has reached a critical point in its history. With the Jewish state secure from British colonialism and Arab revolution, there is no longer anything left to unify the various political factions of the state. As the Labour Zionists, the Poale Zion, and the Revisionist Zionists under Ze’ev Jabotinsky attempted to form a new government, radicals in the Lehi and Irgun turned on Jabotinsky, Declaring him to be a “False Zionist”, despite being the founder of their ideology. Jabotinsky has responded by reaffirming his pro-government position, labeling the Irgun and Lehi as treasonous rebels merely masquerading as Zionists. Haim Wizman, provisional president of Israel, made attempts to mediate the conflict between the two groups, but was unsuccessful in even getting them to agree to a negotiation. In a last ditch effort to avoid persecution by the newly formed Mossad, Avraham Stern has led joint Irgun-Lehi forces in an assault on the capitol in an attempt to arrest Jabotinsky and coup the government. As Stern’s cabal tried to march up the steps of the capitol building, they found Haganah militias waiting for them there. Thinking quickly, Stern improvised a speech to sway them to their side.

The chairman should consider what to do in this situation. Israel may be a valuable asset in the task of world revolution, but at the same time it may draw the International into a premature war with the British. Recognition of Israel's independence will cause Arab workers to view Germany with skeptical eyes which will slow the expansion of socialism in the Middle East.On the other hand, however, in the long run and with small efforts on the part of Germany, it will enable the creation of a socialist fortress in the Middle East, which will be able to flourish under German protection. It will also be seen as a blow against world capital in view of the exceptionally tragic history of the Jews which will give Germany the title of defender of the oppressed. No matter what decision the president makes, it will eventually have to be answered to the government in Jerusalem."

Jewish nationalists managed to push back the attacks from the nasty Arabs, however, it is not known whether the British will try to destroy Israel to avoid the Lehi threat. The French will be able to have an ally to help attack the British colonies, but the Jews want protection in return.It is rather a pragmatic cooperation resulting from the existing situation than a friendly proposal. The Jews still remember that the French were reluctant to see their customs as nonconformists, but the government in Jerusalem is prepared to forget the wrongs as long as the French support the Jews militarily. This will allow the Jews to gather the necessary forces to make an effective offensive, and in return the French will be able to deal a serious blow to the British and their servant Arabs from Egypt."

The reply from Le Soleil finally arrived at his office, and he was ready to begin reading to find out what exactly it was about. Stern was pleased with his results. The French agreed to support Israel in their fight against the reactionaries. This will have many benefits for both sides. For Jews, it will be technological, military and economic development. For the French, the opportunity to increase their influence in the Middle East and Africa, leaving the British and their colonies in the stalemate."

The reply from Le Soleil had finally arrived, and he was ready to begin reading to find out what exactly it was about. Stern was disappointed.The French responded aggressively to the request of the Jews. They do not intend to support a relatively weak state that may turn against them in the long run. They called Stern's reign crypto-reactionary considering elements such as secular traditionalism or familiarity with religious sects. The investment in Israel could turn against the French because they are not even sure whether the Jews will actually be willing to support the French in a potential war against the British. Stern believed that even without the French, the Lehi government would be able to defend itself against the Arabs and the British, but nevertheless felt disappointed by the attitude of the French, who prefer ideological matters to pragmatists."

In addition to trade agreements, he asked for the recognition of Israel's independence as a separate state from the Kingdom of Syria and the possibility of joining the Commonwealth. Britain will gain a valuable ally in the Middle East because even though Israel is a young, small country, it has quite a strong development potential. The problem is that Israel does not have good relations with the Arab states, which may end in increasing oil prices, but also the risk of Arab attacks on the Trucial States. Not to mention bringing Britain into a potential war in the Middle East. At a time of global instability, providing rival powers the chance to weaken British influence in the Middle East and could even deprive British Trucial States on the Arabian peninsula. The refusal will also amount to a certain stain on honor related to the refusal of another democratic country to cooperate, however the Prime Minister of Great Britain should think carefully before making a decision."

As the group stared amazed at the spectacle, a corporal walked past them.\n\n“That’s Cohen, sarge. All the newspapers went crazy about him yesterday!”\n\nThe group stared at the corporal blankly. A Cohen in Israel didn’t seem all that special.\n\n“Morris Cohen! Two-Guns Cohen! Madman fought in China; everyone says he’s brilliant. Seems he finally decided to fly all the way back home.

ISR_asternruleinzion_desc:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the radical Zionist group known as "Lehi", headed by Avraham "Yair" Stern, has seized power in Israel. Stern, a long time zionist and visionary, has grand goals for the new nation of Israel. A new glorious nation, which stretches from the Nile in the west to the Euphrates in the east, a true homeland for the long oppressed and forgotten Jewish people. With the zionist visionary stern as head of Israel we have great hope for the future of the nation and its people."
ISR_immigrationfromyemen:0 "Immigration from Yemen"
ISR_immigrationfromyemen_desc:0 "While many other Jewish communities in various nations have altered or changed their doctrines, traditions, or worship practices substantially from the Jews of old, Yemeni Jews have remained a community that has largely stuck to the original Hebrew customs. From the first Jews settling in the region, the various conflicts among Arabs that have devastated the Jewish population in the area, to the brutal Exile of Mawza, the Yemeni Jews have faced great struggles and strife within their communities. Now that a new homeland exists for Jews across the world, we expect many Yemeni Jews to arrive fleeing persecution and we will accept them with open arms. We will greet them not as foreigners, but long lost brothers and sisters."
ISR_thenewjewishman:0 "The New Jewish Man"

This can be excused, however, by the fact that a Jewish state has not existed since the time of the Romans. We can, however, fix this mess and bring back our glorious Hebrew roots for the good of Israel. We must not forget our heritage, the one thing that binds all of us together, and we must instead face the rebirth of God's chosen people!"
