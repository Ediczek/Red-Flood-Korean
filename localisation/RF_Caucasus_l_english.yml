#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
KAV_DESC_MENU:0 "The Red Army, retreating south, fortified their position in the Caucasus. In this easily defensible position they managed to fend off the White attacks. The cornered Bolsheviks needed a strong visionary to guide them in these hard times. Their saviour became none other than Vladimir Mayakovsky, a futurist poet and revolutionary. He reorganised the Red forces in the Caucasus into a republic that became known as the Kavkaz Society - a land of poets and prophets. The Society transcends the divide that brings Europe into flames, instead presenting a synthesis of the two most revolutionary projects of modernity – Futurism and Communism."

KAV_marvellous_descriptions_of_future_desc:0 "Not only does Marx fuel the great ideas that captivate our minds, but so does the rich thought of Russia holds equal status to the classics of communism. And among the Russians, our most beloved is Fedorov. Our endeavour is not only a social revolution, but the ascension of humanity to an angelic state! With the power of science and technology, we shall make ourselves perfect and immortal, bring nature under our dominion and finally reach to the stars and conquer the Universe!"
KAV_neoboyar_aesthetic:0 "Union of Mystical and the Practical"
KAV_neoboyar_aesthetic_desc:0 "Our revolution needs a revival of Christianity. Not in the slave-driving, oppresive and dead form that rules in the Kolchakocracy, but instead a Christianity of life, of progress and of freedom! Our churches are factories, our psalm is the buzzing of machinery, our communion is oil and electricity! Every new house we build, every new railway brings us one step closer to the grand and heavenly transfiguration of the flesh we stride towards."
KAV_russification_over_all:0 "Bolshevism for Eurasia!"
KAV_russification_over_all_desc:0 "Bolshevism is for us something greater than the philistine communism of the Germans and their like. The teachings of Bogdanov and Lenin fall in the same profound tradition of Muscovy and Byzantium, Genghis Khan and Ivan the Terrible. In other words - Bolshevism is nothing less but the fulfilment of the Russian-Eurasian idea. We are the guardians of true Russia, more than any Black Hundredist reactionary. We uphold the ancient spirit of cooperation, while they degenerate it. We appeal to grand ideas, while they feed on base fears. Let us embrace our heritage and proudly call ourselves National Bolsheviks!"
KAV_discourage_tribal_nationalism:0 "Cult of Industry and Electricity"
KAV_discourage_tribal_nationalism_desc:0 "Is there something more beautiful than the force that moves heavy blocks metal to a fury that brings the lion and the elephant to shame? Can any song rival the knocking of the hammer and the roar of the engine? This beauty is the ultimate expression of human creativity, the great force that tames the dark forces and nature, that brings them into submission to a perfect order! The engine and the electric line will be the ideal towards which all of our state shall strive."

KAV_on_the_matter_of_society_desc:0 "The masses of Kavkaz are already awakened by the revolutionary fire - now it is time to give shape to this enthusiasm. We will beat the hot iron of society with the hammer of the state until the utopia of our dreams comes. First plans of all the grandiose social engineering projects are already in motion, it is time to speed things up! Like our comrades in the West - Faster!"
KAV_fast_social_state:0 "Avant-Garde Communism"
KAV_fast_social_state_desc:0 "While we are Futurists, we are also equal parts Bolsheviks - we hold full allegiance to the two most revolutionary projects of modernity. Only in a synthesis can they both realise themselves. For what is Futurism when humanity still toils under the tyranny of capital, its creative forces enslaved? And what is Communism if the ghosts of old culture still haunt the proletariat? Let us bury the past, as we bring about a new world!"
KAV_encourage_innovation:0 "New Socialist Science"
KAV_encourage_innovation_desc:0 "The liberated society needs to remake the way it learns about the world too. What the bourgeois found “immoral” or “insane” should be no concern for the New Man of the Future. All the wild and crazy ideas are now to be considered! All idols and taboos of the old shall perish! And when we bury the old, we can begin the real construction. Many of our academics dream of an integrated, organic and holistic science, in the spirit of Bogdanov and Tsiolkovsky. Let this be the beginning of something even greater."
KAV_invite_foreign_bourgeoisie:0 "Introduce NEP"
KAV_invite_foreign_bourgeoisie_desc:0 "Let us not fall into the traps of voluntarist delusions - to create communism we need to first develop the productive forces, and the only way to do it is through allowing the bourgeois class to be active. Our current system of state economy thwarts the capitalists too much - we should allow for private industry and introduce market elements to our economy. Though it may hurt our idealism, this is the only way to real progress. After all, it is the capitalists who will sell us the rope with which we will hang them."
KAV_proletarian_corporatism:0 "Begin the Five Year Plan"
KAV_proletarian_corporatism_desc:0 "Our revolution shall not surrender to the temptations of the capitalist roaders. We will continue our road to communism on a straight path of state planning. Our experts have already drafted a grand plan of industrialisation that will reforge Caucasus into a worthy cradle of the Future! All remaining private property will be nationalised, opening the way towards true socialism, workers will be organised into labour armies, and the State shall take over all facets of economic life."

The workers’ state only needs these raw mass energies for creation - our new economy will be moving perfectly, like a self-replicating machine. Strict supervision and bold dreams will be able to bring all the bounty of nature under our dominion!"
KAV_privatized_and_open_to_the_world:0 "Allow Foreign Investment"
KAV_privatized_and_open_to_the_world_desc:0 "Kavkaz was until now a closed kingdom, guarded from the corrosive influence of international markets. It is time for us to open the doors at last. Flow of foreign money will give us the money we need to sustain our grand projects. Maybe it’s not the most poetic measure, but we have to make compromises to survive."

KAV_join_fiumefrench_alliance_desc:0 "The League Solar is the only Accelerationist bloc with the influence and power to spread our ideals worldwide.

We have to keep that in mind when considering to introduce any other language to the realm itself next to it. Onto these foundations we have to put down the thesis that only Russian should be considered to be the official language of the Kavkaz society. If we were to allow other minuscule languages we would tear our nation apart along the lines of barriers built by linguistic differences alone.

We do not have to work towards assimilation at every cost for the sake of greatness if it is going to instead alienate people and rob them of their history, their soul.

Isn't the one who has the pen in hand the one who truly decides the future of the people? Thought out to replace this tyranny of words is the language of Zaum brought together by Velimir Khlebnikov and his colleague Aleksei Kruchenykh. It is the anti-thesis to anything our current standards confine us to as it is freeing us of the shackles that bind our tongue and expand it beyond the common rationality of man. Brought forward first as lyrical experiment Zaum schools expanded through the realms of the Kavkaz society with intellectuals voicing their explicit support for it's spread through literature. Standing at the crossroads to define the character of our nation we seek to steer towards the beauty of sound symbolism as we must restore our ancient Slavic tongue through the experience of poetic beauty alone. Furthermore our people have to be made aware of the changes introduced as public gatherings, even festivals must be held to celebrate the beauty of the zaumic tongue. Nothing but organic is the creation of words for we abolish the confining boundaries of the old books for good. Our language has to live by the standards defined by Mayakovsky's prophetic words alone "We have to glorify life, it is demanded by the existence of our nation."

We must learn to use this might accordingly as it is often overseen in its influence as we aspire to be a society far beyond the regular scope of our times. With Khlebnikov fully aware of the power being held by word alone we are in the process of creating a concept language. "Zaum" (roughly translating to "transreason", "transration" or "beyonsense"), a word itself constructed by the Russian prefix за (za) meaning "beyond, behind" and the noun ум (um) describing "the mind, intellect", is the term we assign our new language. With our goals in mind we desire nothing less than the expansion of our literary sphere to enable us to communicate our ideals to the fullest potential. Man must be able to express himself to the fullest expression without having forced upon the yoke of an artificial construct! Surely it will mean a lot of work to completely define a language and even more to convince the people of our nation to use it, but we have to accomplish it for our sake. Hereby we set upon ourselves the destiny to create a meaningful tongue based on symbolism rather than dogma, to return to the ancient language given to us in primeval times.

Send long-range bombers right into the heart of the enemies territory, let them feel the wrath of our nation as kilotons of explosives rain upon the enemy like fiery raindrops sent as their biblical doomsday!More moderate elements propose using our airforce for battlefield support as cavalry from the skies. Our men may never be fearful as a guardian angel guides their steps from above, ready to call strike at the enemy in a heroic leap of faith for they dive towards the enemy.Lastly a more pragmatic wing of the officer staff emerged as an interest group promoting the usage tactical bombers.

And so, one day at exactly 5:32 PM, Velimir got out of his seat after days of incessant clock-watching and moving things around on his room to the march of the clock, painting pictures according to the constant clock noise, hammering a table; he quickly gathered a multitude of people across Tiblis to proclaim to them something. Nobody knew for sure except for his closest aids. He grabbed a large clock and his watch on his pulse, and demanded the presence of an orchestra. Of course, being the leader of the country, he managed to gather a number of musicians to begin introducing whatever he wanted to bring. Of course, these strange and sudden pieces of performance art weren't uncommon, but for the Chairman to do it like this felt even stranger. He began breathing to the tick of the clock, opening the clock up and looking at it's internal mechanisms, fucntioning by the very existence of mystical laws of Space-Time, and so he demanded the orchestra to begin playing to the march of the clock, as he screamed; \"We shall bend time and yet march with it to the Future!\nCome with me, to the great State of Time which I proclaim today!\" Applause.

Is all the work for the revolution going to perish? Are we falling into reaction? Should we trust an aristocrat in charge? The tension rose even stronger when Chairman Mirsky announced that he would be present at the opening himself. \n\nMirsky entered the hall, with his usual gentleman’s grace, before him a crowd of party bureaucrats, professors and students. He began his speech in a calm, rational tone - a great contrast from Mayakovsky. \n\n \"Comrades! I welcome you at the opening of the Faculty of Theology at our Proletarian University. Before I begin I will address your concerns about this decision first. It was said among many of our comrades that teaching theology in a progressive socialist university is a cruel joke towards socialism, that we are sliding into reaction. I assure you - no such a thing is happening!\" \n\n Murmurs began among the crowd, how is he going to explain it? \n\n \"The perspective from which we teach has nothing to do with the science taught in Tsarist academias. We will enforce no orthodoxy, and are welcoming towards new, revolutionary interpretations of faith. It was agreed in the foundations of our Federation, that a revolution in sciences is needed - and we have to make sure that the revolution extends to all sciences. We also stated, that, a deeper spiritual revolution has to come after the political revolution\" \n\n The murmurs slowly ceased into silence. \n\n \"This brings me to my second point - it was said that theology is an useless endeavour, an impractical science, thus having no place in this university. Nothing could be further from the truth! Theology is a most practical science. It is the architecture of the Second Revolution we are meant to begin. \n\n Let me demonstrate: Progressive theology says that our faith, Orthodoxy, is not mere monotheism but a certain synthesis between monotheism and pantheism. While God is a being on His own, he becomes through actualising Himself in the material world. This task of fulfilling God is beholden on us, mankind. All our technological and industrial effort, can mystically be conceived as a transfiguration of the flesh to bring it to the divine!\" \n\n Some shouts of protest came from the audience, yet Mirsky seemed to ignore them. Fools. \n\n \"I hope you can see, comrades, how this example proces how useful are the ideological concepts theology can bring to our task of a total revolution in culture.\" \n\n After a few seconds of silence, someone began to clap - soon, the entire hall clapped.

A grand rediscovery of his work is rushing like a storm through our universities. As the fascination continues, the regime claims Tsiolkovsky as a progenitor of their vision. Comrade Mirsky himself inaugurated the opening of a monument dedicated to the great scientist in Tiflis.  Every scientist can look up to this great man, whose discoveries helped our way to the stars. \n\nHis theories of human creativity eventually spreading out to the stars, and of a living universe progressing towards perfection have captivated the minds of Kavkazian intellectuals. They filled the public imagination with visions of distant planets, shooting rockets and interstellar empires. \n\nThe practical legacy of Tsiolkovsky overshadows his public cult, the use our scientists made of his equations has proven irrefutable.

Come on vanguard of the Future! Dare! Stomp the bourgeois! Enough with the law of Adam and Eve! A more heavenly gold we have!

The great leader was covered in cold sweat - he has come thus far, this will be his final testament in history. He had to gather his will - destroy all the forces of remorse and dedicate himself to the deed. He stood for a minute. Finally, he moved his muscles. He did it - he pushed the thing! A spark of energy zapped through the wire immediately. What happened next, went to history books. \n\nThe few seconds felt like an eternity. First, a ball of fire, emerging from the heart of the ancient palace like an eye of a wrathful god, who suddenly aged, grew in the grey hair of smoke and dust. The dusty clouds swirled in fantastical shapes, there was a smell of the fabric of history in them. \n\nThe heart of the old world was gone, the historic task of destruction fulfilled - now it is time for creation, the rubbles of the Kremlin can’t blemish the streets of Moscow forever. There is a certain mystical power in them - it will be utilised. A new palace will rise - much greater than what came before. A structure of steel and concrete, to house the future Communist Party of the World. The ruins of the castle of the Tsars will give foundations for the capital of the international proletariat, the nexus of all-human power. \n\nAnd thus, the Russian civilization entered a new, profound plane of existence, free from the symbol of its old power."

As a former White Guard officer, still clinging to some nationalist ideas the hard left of the party mistrusted him. Others thought that he was a visionary, who achieved a historical synthesis of thought. He found many followers, captivated by the vision of an universal empire, building and directing life, spreading infinitely in time and space. The man who was a source of these grand ideas was often described as unremarkable - a well-mannered gentleman known for his kindness and love of beauty stood in stark contrast to the Bolshevik thugs that were his allies. \n\nThe talks around the table faded into silence, Mirsky was to make a toast.

Sometimes he wanted to retire, for the love of God, he was over forty! This is not fitting for a gleaming futurist state. Every new grey hair on his head terrified him - he quietly wished for a heroic death in battle, that could free him from this shame. \n\nBut he also had responsibilities, the weight of the revolution laid heavily on his back - he knew that he had to carry it. For who will replace him? Mirsky? He has the right spirit, but he is too meek, still spoiled by his aristocratic roots.

Tall and burly, every eye in the room closely followed him like the planets orbit the sun.

The evidence of his crimes is universal and omnipresent!"\n\nSome specially ecstatic men had even fired off their guns in the air during the speech, as the hollers and screams of the crowd were so unbearably loud that one would believe an earthquake was about to swallow the old church. When the tribunal had calmed down, Mayakovsky began speaking again.\n\n"I would sentence the criminal, the tyrant, to death, so that the people of the world may know themselves as tyrannicides. However, it is obvious God knows how to come back from the dead, does he not?" Roaring approval and affirmation again. "In the name of mankind I sentence God to banishment! When the free people of the world has liberated itself from the yoke of slavery, when every inch of land is as godless as it has always been, when God has no chance of returning from the grave, then and only then will we turn our heads to him!
