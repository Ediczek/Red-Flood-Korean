#Brief history
UKR_DESC_MENU:0 "인테르마리움에서 가장 위대한 등대들 중 하나이자 또한 그의 곡창지대인 자유로운 우크라이나는 발전 중인 민주국가로서 세계에서 이름이 난 나라로, 강력한 복지와 전반적으로 성장 중인 경제를 갖고 있습니다. 하지만 의회에서 벌어지는 부패를 경멸하는 많은 이들 가운데엔, 전국에 깔린 독일 협력파와, 우크라이나의 자유를 지키기 위해 군사위원회가 필요하다 말하는 이들도 있습니다. 그러나 또 다른 집단이 우크라이나 전역에서 나타나고 있으니, 바로 촉진주의 연정입니다. 국가의 미래를 위한 이 대난투에서 과연 누가 이기게 될까요?"

Our opponent is the Russian warlord Alexander Dutov. Probably one of the many Kolchak's bootlickers.

ukraine.1.desc:0 "When it seemed that the day in the parliament won't get any worse, it was spotted that an MP from a fairly minor centre-right party was going to the podium. It took several seconds for the audience to process that this MP was Mykola Mikhnovsky himself. Some yawned, others prepared to listen, knowing that what will follow won't be constituted of anything except bullshit. Or so it usually appeared. Mikhnovsky took the position at the podium, overseeing the halls of Central Rada. So majestic, even if rather small, this house provided such a picture of democracy's infallibility...such an illusion of it.\n-Dear citizens of Ukraine, dear men and women, dear cossacks, and undear scum that are elected to this very council by the people you fool! - Mikhnovsky began his speech, took a cup of water, and continued:\n-When I look at these halls, I always adore - well, “adore” - how utterly pompous and majestic our parliamentarians always behave, and how truly unyielding our democracy looks...at a first glance. In truth, however, - you all know! - that this is a lie. And yes, journalists, write it down, the masses need to know the truth. It is a lie - that nothing threatens our democracy! I can say for sure - three quarters of present here deputies are corrupted, at least a third of those corrupted are involved in voting fraud, - for there's no other reason for those three people over there in UPSR sector to be re-elected, everyone knows the peasants' opinion on that party in the region! And what, you might ask, is everything I told, for that is all old news - both to you and to the public. But let me say it... I don't care if it's going to kill me... What I definitely know, is that half of the parliament is working for Germans! YES! Half of you bastards are working as shills for disgusting krauts in Berlin, you have sold your Fatherland for a piece of bratwurst, just because your VKSSS puppet masters tell ya! I don't care whether you laugh at me right now, for I know that what you truly abhor - for you fear the truth, the truth just right now revealed!\nWhen deputy Mykola Mikhnovsky later got into a much more rambling, and progressively more and more incomprehensible ranting, group of MPs urged him to get down and back to his seat, which Mykola reluctantly agreed after two notebooks and a tomato thrown at him. When normal proceedings resumed, some deputies did look quizzically at Mikhnovsky, but that wasn't something odd - dude had already established his reputation as a jingoistic clown. Anyway, newspapers were expected to publish this story, and some MPs did get uneasy during the speech, one of them saying that perhaps a snap election year ahead the schedule would increase the people's confidence in democracy. As the break between meetings was announced, MPs and journalists alike went to the parliamentary cafeteria. Of them, two people separated from the main group. One said to other…"

Weird, this situation was. Private plane from Kaunas, with two engines and enough space to fit in thirty passengers, although only ten were on board. “Four Baltic Germans from Riga, three Lithuanians, two Prussians and a Dutchman? All boarding a private plane belonging to a Prussian nobleman, with this as cargo?!” - said Kost’ in French to one of passengers, who appeared to be some sort of informal leader to three or four other passengers...with disturbingly un-civilian manners. Meanwhile, Tymish went to another group of border guards, who were inspecting the cargo. He walked to one of the boxes which the plane was transporting - nothing suspicious, at a first glance. Having nothing to do, as no passenger was really that suspicious, Tymish kicked the box slightly with his boot. A metal cling. \nAlerted by this, the officer took out a knife and cracked the box open. What was inside shouldn’t have been on a cargo of a normal civilian plane. \nNoticing this, one of the passengers softly walked up to Tymish’s back and touched the border guard...with a concealed revolver.

We shall show those idiots what a true Ukrainian is made of!”\nSuch words were said at the opening of “Ukrainian Artistic Conference” by Mykhail’ Semenko, who negotiated it with Bolbochan and Bolbochan’s henchmen in Kyiv city duma. Said conference was actually less of an artistic event and more of a political rally, since besides the many futurists and modernists, including rather famous and talented artists, here were present leaders of various paramilitaries, as well as the paramilitaries themselves. In fact, granted how the event was held right on Dumska square, and that most of the present here carried weapons with them, some not even hiding it, the only thing worth waiting for was Bolbochan’s letter.\nAnd here it was. Oh, how wonderful this news was to Accelerationist leaders right now! \nIn a matter of minutes, improvised festival-slash-meeting was reorganized into battle columns. Young people from all un-occupied regions of Ukraine, - and rather old people as well, here and there, - some carrying flags, some with slogan-adorned banners, some with rifles, pistols or even swords, both in military uniforms and civilian clothes, traditional rural and fashionable urban - all sorts of people were here, supporters of change, supporters of something that among the establishment only Bolbochan and like-minded people didn’t found offensive.\n“First Squad, MARCH!”\nThe march began. And in less than an hour, when the vanguard of demonstrants has reached Central Rada, shouting anti-Petliura slogans, the march turned into an improvised siege. \nWhen the guardsman tried to block the way, he was threatened with bayonets and almost ran over by the crowd, but somehow he survived, and a few minutes later joined the protestors himself. Doors of the Parliament were rattled with bullets until a girl from the crowd threw a hand grenade at them, cracking them open. Shocked personnel didn’t even resist as the fierce Accelerationist youth charged into the parliamentary halls, shouting the war cry upheld by modern Free Cossacks:"

Three more carefully placed shots, and boom barrier fell to the ground, letting the trucks with few German agents and their Ukrainian accomplices drive through right into the heart of government’s district at Volodymyrska street. \nTwo hours later, the group was already not just inside the parliamentary building - two dozen guards were killed, and the last defenders of bourgeois Ukrainian parliament have gathered at the rooftop for their last stand. It seemed that victory of the forces of historical materialism was near, and soon a puppet...ahem, friendly councilist government would be proclaimed to the sleepy proletariat of Ukraine’s capital as a new administration of Ukrainian Socialist Republic, but...wait, here they are - Ukrainian troops, armed and ready, dozens, hundreds, no - a few thousands of them, all apparently informed about attempted coup. When artillery pieces and tanks were arranged in a circle around Rada building, and hundreds of rifles pointed at all windows and doors, it became apparent that the Luxemburg’s cause was lost...for now. \nAs the perpetrators of failed coup d’etat walked out of building without their machine-pistols, remaining Ukrainian guards down from the rooftop to be awarded medals by the high command, and the prematurely awakened capital listening to crazy news, one thing was said by Skoropadsky while he observed the whole affair from his personal tank:"

Seldom not criticized, but still somewhat respectable president of Ukraine announced that elections will be held one year ahead of the schedule, with any parties which want to participate invited to. While quite obviously there are more than twenty parties in Ukraine, of them ten represented in earlier Rada and eight even having rather good results, only five parties are expected to make any serious gains in this election - Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, an agrarian leftist force backed by few sympathetic cooperators which chose a well-known historian Mykhailo Hrushevs’kyi as its presidential candidate; Ukrainian National-Democratic “Ob’yednannya” (Alliance) with its like-minded partner Ukrainian Party of Socialist Federalists, both of these being Liberal and delegating Yevhen Petrushevych and Dmytro Doroshenko respectively as presidential candidates; Ukrainian Democratic “Khliborobs’ka” (Peasant) Party - a conservative democratic party led by another historian and diplomat, Vyacheslav Lypynsky; and finally the party in power - Ukrainian Social Democratic “Robitnycha” (Labour) Party, as always supporting Petliura despite complaints from the internal opposition.

To save Ukraine from its worst evil - the treachery from within - one must be ready to sacrifice even one’s own life. Even if not at the frontlines, then surely due to overworking.\nWalking up to the podium, Pavlo wondered what kind of thoughts visited the heads of the previous speakers. Did they also burden themselves with the noble task of safeguarding Ukraine’s existence like him - or were they just parasites coming to power purely for personal gain? \"Whatever, that doesn’t matter now\" - he said to himself, fixing his uniform and looking at the audience.\n“My dear Ukrainians”, he spoke. “Today, our Republic stands at the edge of the abyss.

A man in the USDRP section apparently knew already what was going to happen, as did a deputy or two in UPSR sector.\nSkoropadsky looked at the crowd with his piercing stare, and spoke - his words being carried around the country by radio and written down by the journalists:“I hereby proclaim the military’s authority over entire Ukraine, temporarily pausing the article of Constitution concerning the presidency, and dissolve the parliament in the name of Ukraine immediately, question of next elections being postponed until the salvation is brought to our Fatherland.”"

And only then, having his rifle grabbed, he walked to the front door. \nWhen two children were already a mile away from their village, they saw light. And no, it wasn’t just their house that was burning. Unable to satisfy their desire of carnage by slaughtering just one dissident, Drozdovites burned down the entire village. Those criminals, those marauders have shot on sight anyone trying to escape. The two kids who got over the border, the book still relatively intact, were the only villagers who have survived to tell this story.’ \nSo this is what our compatriots are fleeing.

New envelope, rolled into a cylinder - invitation to lunch. \nWhile in the elevator, Sofia thought about what was happening to her and around her in the past few months. Firstly, her brother, who had tuberculosis, got a rather cheap ticket by the so-called “Teliha programme” to Italy, where he was being healed while having his expenses covered by state medical budget, expanded by Mala Rada’s decree some three months ago. It was rather wonderful that airplanes now were both faster and cheaper, and (judging by her brother’s telegrams) pretty comfortable too - and it was a Ukrainian airlines’ plane, not French or British. Then, the overall goods’ quality was improved, Sofia had a pay high enough to buy a car - and yes, she no longer worked for that asshole landlord as his kids’ tutor, for she got a prestigious job at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - where she was right now, enjoying a top quality lunch in a room done according to art deco style. And yes, while her own perspectives were wonderful, the ones of the state were even better. In the newsreel she had a glimpse of before going to lunch, Sofia saw that the great president Olena Teliha had intention of reclaiming Ukrainian territories beyond the Dnipro river, intention of entering the grand alliance of forces of progress - which was implied to be Fiume and France. Sofia’s grandma may disagree, but it was obvious to everyone else - whatever should be done to expand Ukraine’s glory is justified, because in the end, every Ukrainian will enjoy progress just as much as Sofia and her colleagues."

It was kind of weird - labour here, in Ukraine, was regimented, but spirit was more optimistic, time schedule was rather strict, but he had more free time than before, and most importantly - Frederick, a former KPD activist, felt himself much more free to breathe when this very KPD was not around, but hundreds of kilometres away. He didn’t know why, but life seemed like heaven right now."

Although both Ukraine and the Kavkaz Society have expressed admiration and loyalty to Antonin Artaud, leader of the futurist French state, both leaders have expressed their desire for a futurist bloc that is “uniquely Slavic”, and outside the French sphere of influence. Although some expected Artaud to react with anger at such a proposition, Artaud was quoted as simply saying, “The only people in Europe who have never ruled the Slavs are the Slavs themselves. I say we let them have a go at it.” Considering the good time had by all in Batumi, as well as the approval of Artaud, the marriage between Ukraine and the Kavkaz is sure to be a happy and fruitful one."

This time, Bender’s goal was the tracking down of an elusive \"underground millionaire\" Koreiko. From there on, the story unfolds on a truly epic scale, with Ostap’s adventures across the Black Sea coast and Steppes leading him to a certainly unusual finale, which the authors asked not to reveal prematurely in any newspaper reviews. As usual, readers should expect a lot of Odessite humour, lots of interesting characters and funny situations, and an answer to a question which was already stated by many fans of the writer duo - what are Ostap Bender’s real motives, and would there ever be a part three of this epic story?"

Petliura is a man of many controversies, many backroom deals, many victories, and many successes, but also primarily of pragmatism. Unsuccessful in the Christian priesthood, he strove for being a priest of the Ukrainian nation: a just leader who will bring his fellow Ukrainians to the glory of socialism. His chance came when the state was born in the ashes of the Great War. The long battle with Russia, where his star rose through vigorous military action and cooperation with the Polish, was the beginning of his hard work to keep the Ukrainian spirit alive.\n\n After the war with Kolchakist Russia, Petliura was elected the first President of Ukrainian People's Republic on June 16, 1922. Admittedly, for all his heroism, the lessons he learned from watching the developing Polish state led him to certain conclusions about civilian politics. The President found himself seeking to emulate his friend Józef Piłsudski in governing. After his reelection in 1927, Petliura was ready to begin the centralization of power and transition to a regime similar to the Sanation, but unlike in Poland, his coalition in the Rada ruptured within three years and he was forced to not seek re-election in 1932. While his status as a war hero prevented any legal consequences from dogging him, he found himself only a spectator in Ukrainian politics.\n\nThis has changed once more, though who knows for how long. His successor Mykola Mikhnovsky, evidently having felt the same lure of power, was thrown from power, and Petliura once again took the mantle of a liberating hero in Kyiv. It is unclear whether he will herald a return to the old days, or step down to begin something new. For now, Petliura rules with the absolute power he has long believed he needs to return stability and prosperity to Ukraine - in preparation for the ultimate war against its Muscovite lords."
UKR_volodymyr_vynnychenko_desc:0 "Volodymyr Kyrylovych Vynnychenko is a patron saint of workers, writers, democrats, and utopia builders. For many more-orthodox Marxists he is a naive optimist promising sausage to swipe voters for the USDRP. To himself, he is something more - a dreamer, but not the only one. With his Nietzsche-influenced socialism and Marxist teachings, he wishes to create a patriotic yet harmonious state where all would live in peace with oneself, others, the state, and nature. His dreams began when he was just a peasant boy from a rural family, and he long aspired to help those around him in the struggle for freedom.\n\nHe and his colleagues from USDRP formed the Directorate that served as Ukraine's provisional government. Assuming that the socialist dominance of the first government would allow the general population to mostly vote for their preferred flavour of socialism, Vynnychenko was a vocal voice for democratic elections, and for a time he was correct.  During the parliamentary elections, the USDRP was dominant... for some time. Petliura's controversial nature revealed the gulf between the party's allies and their own factions was deeper than expected, leading to the rightist takeover of the government. Mikhnovsky, assuming his old allies would one day come for him, focused most of his ire and force on the USDRP while in power. He was not mistaken.\n\nPetliura's cooperation with the Poles to cast down Mikhnovsky had a price - his replacement with a less controversial but no less ambitious socialist. President Volodomyr Vynnychenko, having learned well from the last few years, has outlined the blueprint of a labour democracy arrayed against the rightist forces, viewing it as a necessary evil to preserve socialism in Ukraine. With this, the USDRP has once again become the main party of socialism in government. A grand campaign of anti-theistic and anticonservative reforms is planned to liberate the people from a decadent and stifling past and thrust them into a world where innovation is approved of. And so, another old hero of Ukrainian independence takes the stage, promising ecological reforms, a new collectivization of land, new workplaces - and of course, a new Ukrainian socialism."
UKR_lazar_kaganovich_desc:0 "Lazar Moiseyovych Kahanovych, an iron man of an iron heart and iron will - the unstoppable machine that will strike down the revisionists and enemies of the state. Kahanovych is not a visionary or a dreamer, but he is efficient. Born to a Jewish family near Kyiv, he participated in the Bolshevik movement through its most intense power struggles before the Great War. With the exile of his patron Vladimir Lenin, however, he would not leave the party, but instead advocate for cooperation between the "western" and "eastern" socialists to meet their common goals. When the fortunes of the revolutionaries began to falter in the Civil War, however, Kahanovych was sent back to Kyiv by the RSDLP in order to salvage something from the situation. With the independence of the Ukrainian state, he became a leading member of the newborn UKP.\n\nThough he would admit he found Semenko a fine poet, he had his own private concerns about the idealistic chairman of the party. Was a quasi-futurist iconoclast really the best choice to unite the communists? Still, he believed in what he had for decades - the necessity of a strong vanguard party to seize control of and transform the state. Mikhnovsky's crisis finally provided the opportunity, both for himself and the party. By positioning himself as the stable and competent alternative to Semenko, Kahanovych quickly became the unofficial leader of UKP, and when he broke the USDRP revolting against Little Napoleon Petliura and his goons, he made sure most of the defecting Esdeks came into his camp as he become a reincarnation of Babeuf leading a new red revolution and a new red terror.\n\nIn this way, he banished Semenko from his position and became the leader of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. Despite making no secret of his use of force, a good portion of the populace sees him as a stabilizing figure, both a champion of the downtrodden and a Ukrainian patriot. What is his goal, then, now that Kahanovych has the machinery of the state in his hands? Nothing less than the total transformation of the country, taking this backward state into a communist future. The price demanded by this task remains to be seen. The results, however, could be unfathomable."
UKR_semen_man_desc:0 "Mykhaylo Vasyliovich Semenko is a man of many obsessions, of many passions, and of many ideas - a prophet of cosmic communism free of outdated nationalisms and united in a proletarian avant-garde culture. A futurist from his earliest days, Semenko was raised as a poet and would-be visionary. Due to his charisma, organizational talent, and popularity, he was able to punch above his weight against the Old Bolshevik core of the UKP, believing them no less old-fashioned than the other parties. Making the pitch to become Chairman, Semenko embraced a different spirit. He saw that Ukraine was a creation of Tsarists to weaken the proletarian mind, nothing but an obstacle to science, art, and above all, communism.\n\nThe UKP under his tenure embraced a more Kavkazian model, rejecting nationalistic devations. For Semenko, Skyrypnyk and other fools were disconnected from reality or just opportunists who sought to secure their secures by waving the national flag. Of course, the fervor with which he attacked the old guard was not without controversy, sending to many fleeing into Kahanovych's hands and the "Independent" wing of the party. Perhaps it would have doomed him, had Mikhnovsky's fall and the USDRP's search for allies not given him a route to control over the country. Dissatisfied with Vynnychenko's vague utopianism and Petliura's authoritarianism, many Esdeks were receptive when Semenko reached out to promise a true form of socialism.\n\nAnd so, Semenko cemented the rule of the UKP, and now he sets his sights on the opposition, purging the rightists with no mercy and pushing for absorption or illegalization of the other leftist parties. Together with his lieutenants Khrushchev and Volobuyev, the plan is no less than the total reconstruction of Ukraine, leaving not an inch of grass on the ground, the landscape filled with man-made metal constructs touching the very skies and striving for the stars. A union of proletarian struggle and a poetic aristocracy prepares to complete a revolution from above and below that will forge a new liberated realm of workers."
UKR_mykola_mikhnovsky_desc:0 "Mykola Ivanovych Mikhnovsky, if nothing else, is one of the grand old men of the Ukrainian independence movement. Even in those decades where most of the nationalists were concerned with cultural autonomy within the Russian Empire, the young student of Kyiv University yearned for more. With an upbringing rooted in Cossack heritage and full of folk songs and literature, he aligned with the Taras Fraternity, which advocated for a free Ukraine spanning between the Carpathians and the Caucasus Mountains.\n\nIt all might have come to nothing if not for the Great War. In the early twentieth century, even the independence movement was politically divided, and Mikhnovsky's militant actions maxed out at the occasional destruction of Russian monuments in Ukraine. The outbreak of the war saw him alternate between frontline service and working in military courts, but the growing instability of the Empire finally gave him the opportunity he was looking for. Mikhnovsky joined other nationalists in the declaration of an independent Ukraine in 1918, though executive power would always slip through his grasp. While Symon Petliura and the other military men of the revolution grew in power, he found himself an uneasy parliamentary ally of the USDRP as a last resort.\n\nThe first decades of a free Ukraine were a mixed blessing. The frustration of nationalist ambitions in the east and west burned bright in his heart, and his appraisal of Petliura's clique as inexperienced radicals never quite diminished as factionalism in the Rada continued. Mikhnovsky also became one of the more respectable faces of skepticism to the Intermarium, publicly voicing concerns that Ukraine had traded one political and economic master for another, continuing their domination by Poles and Jews. His final break with Petliura in 1930, and the failure of the governing coalition to limp on with the support of the far left, eventually saw him become President in 1932. After four years of ratcheting up rhetoric against Warsaw and national minorities, there are concerns that Mikhnovsky may be a prelude to the Intermarium tearing itself apart, if Ukraine does not do so first."
UKR_batko_nash_desc:0 "Stepan Andriyovych Bandera is a manifestation of unmatched power of nature, an avatar of young passionate anger, and the Providnyk of the Ukrainian nation. That this is hardly an exaggeration of the young man speaks volumes. He was always ambitious, quickly becoming second or third in the hierarchy of Ukrainian nationalists on the strength of his conviction and boundless energy. However, unlike Konovalets or Melnyk, Bandera grew disillusioned with the old breed of Ukrainian nationalist thought, and like many other youth in the organization was radicalized by Dmytro Dontsov. Unlike the rest, however, he had enough willpower to act on what he had learned. Bandera vocally opposed the cooperation with Poland that the other "mainstream" nationalists could tolerate, pointing to the history of Ukrainian oppression under Polish overlordship, not to mention the ongoing occupation of Lviv. His involvement in border tensions and nationalist action led to his public profile growing as something of a young hero who could put action to his wishes.\n\nWhen he called for a quest of vengeance that would be remembered through the ages, his voice was not alone. Some aspired to this bloody quest in their own way, some feared it, yet others would join Bandera in his cause. The years after Ukrainian independence failed to live up to lofty expectations, after all, and soon the quarrels of Mikhnovsky and Petliura seemed another albatross around the nation's neck when the real threats advanced on Kyiv. What did it mean for Ukraine when the mad dogs of the UDP and USDRP were only barking at each other while the Russian, the Judeo-capitalist, and the Judeo-communist were at the door?\n\nWhen Petliura called for help from OUN, he expected that they would sit down and negotiate, concessions would be made, and he would resume ruling. It was not enough for OUN - no, the Ukrainian people, and Bandera himself. He struck down the old gods of the Kyivan Olympus, and sustained by the anger inside of him, he led the Ukrainian revolution to its conclusion. And so, a new national state has been born out of discipline and friendship among brothers. There are still many things to do to repair this broken country and to lead it to its natural greatness, but Bandera called for action, and the people heard him! Under the Providnyk, Ukraine will stretch from the Vistula to the Pacific, and nobody will stop this righteous crusade to the borders of the world!"
UKR_bohdan_ihor_antonych_desc:0 "Bohdan Ihor Antonych is many things, but if you asked he would tell you he is a life-loving bard singing the songs of rebellion against the old order. He might even tell you he is just one of many young nationalists who rose up in OUN to demand what was due to them. "Away with Christ and up with the true Solar God!" With the call put out into the wind, patriotic Ukrainians turned their heads to the sky and prepared to build a new Tower of Babel to meet it. From the ashes of a prediluvian past, young man, raise a glorious future!\n\nThe aftermath of the Great War and the persistent frustrations of Ukrainian self-government drove wedges into the broad front of nationalists. Some would confront the problems of Ukraine through newfound faith in communism. Some would find new interpretations of modernized Ukrainian nationalism. Few except Antonych and his friend Volodomyr Shaian considered turning their heads towards the past - but it would not be to Russia, or even Kievan Rus as it was known. Antonych and his clique would instead call back to the ancient civilization of Oriys, builders of the first Ukrainian state, who in centuries past waged war against the Scythians and Muscovites. Of course, this was considered pseudohistorical by most, but some artists, architects, and most importantly peasants would find something evocative about the theories. Could a church covered in gold and with a history of servitude to Moscow have all the answers? Or did Ukraine require a delve into the primeval and esoteric?\n\nPetliura called desperately to the heavens for help, and what descended was not an angel of the rabbi Yeshua but rather one of Dazhbog - the true god of the Ukrainians - that would chase the old nationalist away from Kyiv. Antonych showed the new generation the way to the city's gates, and with divine inspiration they proclaimed a new beginning and a new rebirth. A war is coming, the swords of the Ukrainian state arrayed against all that is tired and apathetic, and at the front of the vanguard is Antonych, the guiding light into the future and past."

After the battery of performance checks on the final turbine, it seems that everything is ready for the grand opening of the Brodnitsya hydroelectric power station - named after the water spirit from Ukrainian mythology, the guardian of reservoirs and the protector of people from evil spirits. Before the ceremony, a rally was held with the participation of prominent party leaders and technical specialists who expressed a desire to share their joy with the people by reading parting words, as, for example, Comrade Volobuyev did:\n\n"A truly great event will take place today! Today, something that will give our country of free proletarians the broadest prospects for development will be launched! The power of Brodnitsya has no analogues; no power plant in the world produces so much energy. The whole world is watching what unprecedented heights the working people reach! This creation is a massive symbol of the connection between people and nature - the movement of water, which creates pressure, is converted into electricity by a means not only cheap anc clean but, in theory, unlimited. As long as it is possible to maintain the equipment, and while the Dnieper flows, we are now capable of powering our whole country independently. I thank everyone who has contributed to such a remarkable success, which was achieved as a result of many years of collective labor."\n\nAfter much applause, all the station's turbines were started one by one, and the energy of hundreds of thousands of horses came online..."

Their faith is in human creation and the power of human will! And what is the best manifestation of this god, of this unstoppable holy force, if not art, the most expressive creation of the human hand? This is a god fit for a new world.\n\nThe temple of old God Yahwe in Vinnytsia was reforged by the human hand to be a lair of art, and today all of the townspeople gathered for a new ritual. Women, men, and children alike came in groups to experience beauty. Icons of Yahwe remained in his old temple but how insignificant did they appear against the children of art? Saints of Yahwe stared fearfully at geometrif paintings of circles, squares, and other assemblages calculated in the human mind and given form by the human spirit. What was the violent sacrifice of the Lamb of God compared to the brute form in moving shapes that became cars and planes put on canvas? What was an icon of a dead man compared to the art of a true resurrection in the stars, or a grandiose video from a military range showing a test of rockets that climbed to the starry sky? How does a dead god give anything beautiful to man? The new templegoers were being impressed on the ability to make meaning in a void of stars which had until now been outside of their concern.\n\nOne old woman appeared less reverent, more sad... maybe even angry. When she came to the depiction of a monstrous pig-capitalist on the cross, with the worker's spear leaving a red star on his side, perhaps the caption reading "we died for their sins" was too much. In a furious act, she threw the iconoclastic painting on the floor and leapt upon it, her body animated with a passion to destroy it. A security guard had almost reached her when a young man in a smock stopped them both with a shout.\n\n"Stop it! Don't arrest her! She did nothing wrong! She did what we were doing to her sacrum. She destroyed our idols as we were destroying hers!"\n\nThis man was the author of this piece of art, and he did not appear as distraught as expected. No, he was smiling and laughing seeing that all. He turned around to the surprised crowd and continued.\n\n"Truly I tell you, this poor widow has become a greater futurist than you all there gathered. You all gave your attention and a short moment of life to the art, but she, out of her rage, put in everything she felt — all the passion and vitality she had to just destroy this one painting!"\n\nWhether out of confusion, embarrassment, or consideration of the role she now played in the futurist model, the old woman fled from the temple. At the request of the artist, she was not arrested, but perhaps she faced a worse fate: to eventually be forgotten with the old world she knew."

Unlikely, given the circumstances of his arrest. What did he do? He knew that his uncle Symon Petliura wasn't the most honest man but what did HE do? Practicing his faith and preaching the good gospel? He was praying intently when another prisoner was brought to the cell, one he found surprisingly familiar. It was Lazar Kaganovych, one of the loudest opponents of Semenko. Skrypnyk was surprised to see this old bastard rotting in a cell with him, and evidently it was obvious enough that the communist chuckled and answered the unspoken thoughts.\n\n"Yeah, I know it's hard to believe that I'm rotting here."\n\nKaganovych sat next to Skrypnyk and saw a rosary in his hand. He pointed his finger at the bauble and continued.\n\n"You believe He will save you? What will save you in here is probably work detail, unless you have the same sentence I do! Ha! What were you doing boy? You know, before the prison?"\n\nSkrypnyk frowned a bit, then replied to Kaganovych, skeptical of his intentions.\n\n"What? I was a priest. But why do you want to talk to me? Don't you have better things to do?"\n\n"Oh don't be so grumpy, son! I would probably order to shoot you if I ruled but..."\n\n"... but you aren't ruling."\n\n"Yes! That's it! Nobody in the seminary brainwashed you completely, and you still can see clearly. But tell me, do you have any family? Father, mother? You know that in the moment before my trial, I'm escaping with my thoughts to my wonderful wife?"\n\n"My mother and father are rather safe... But I don't know what happened to my uncle, Petliura..."\n\n"Wait, your uncle is Petliura? That old bastard? The world is so small! Ha! Ha! Wouldn't guess that. Okay, but I forgot. What is your name, shaveling?"\n\n"Stepan Skrypnyk"\n\n"Nice to meet you."\n\nKaganovych offered a hand. Skrypnyk refused to shake it, yet the prisoner's rough nature didn't seem to be hiding ill intent, and soon...\n\nThe conversation between them lasted a few days, covering everyday matters and ones of political philosophy. Despite their many differences, something approximating a friendship developed between two men, united as they were under one roof.\n\nYet despite Kaganovych's assurances that when he got out of prison, he would find Skrypnyk to take him for a beer or even to a brothel, it couldn't last. Kaganovych was sentenced to death shortly after his imprisonment, and Skrypnyk to hard labor. Still, the priest kept his mind busy, and one of his projects was documenting the old comrade's final conversations in hopes of passing them on to his wife."

You know, the desire for a society that eradicates once and for all the desire of a man to hold power over others. A desire not to become ignorant or naive, but wiser and happier together with brothers and sisters in socialist comradery. Many of you call me a cutthroat for that simple wish, as I didn't make any secret of what we had to do to the Mikhnovites, Banderites, UNDO, the Knights, and the other reactionaries who openly fantasize about throwing us in the Dnieper. Yet look - we simply arrested them for threatening their fellow man." He said the last line cheerily, to some cheers and laughs, before moving on.\n\n"Some of you call me a revisionist, a Leninist, maybe a Bogdanovite or other labels I don't care for. If the interest of the Ukrainian state aligns with the interest of the world revolution, I am for it. For now that means exporting Ukrainian grain and meat to comrades, and importing from them fuel, intellectuals, coal... and most importantly a good drink!"\n\nHe snapped his fingers and bottles of wine entered the Rada and were redistributed. Barrels rolled out of parliament and timidly, citizens began to help themselves with an alcoholic drink. Lazar Kaganovych himself reached for a glass of wine and lifted it and continued his speech, laughing.\n\n"Now, I can't wait for you to call me a drunk communist, a wine communist, or a champagne communist. I don't care! To hell with it, I'm a wine communist if it makes you happy. But I will tell you who I think I am, or at least what I want to be in the eyes of the proletariat. I am Gracchus - the People's Tribune! I cut the price of grain in half to make more bread. I contacted the Poles to start a real railway line from Warsaw to Kyiv. I sweet-talked the Germans about fuelling our new power plants supplying electricity to every household! I met with our comrades in Kavkaz to build a common front against Muscovite imperialism! And I managed to turn this broken machine called Ukraine into a self-sufficient organism."\n\n"Am I a Leninist? Am I still a Bolshevik? Yes, I am! I call for a grander revolution, and a greater Ukrainian state that can break down the walls of division and make the common man happier and wiser too. This is what the word Bolsha means to me and should mean to you. So drink with me! Work with me! As I wish to work with you, even if we have to debate how to do it. We will achieve a better tomorrow today!"\n\nLoud applause from USDRP, Socialist Revolutionaries, and Communists thundered through the Rada.

Plans were drawn up in secret, talks held in backrooms, and a decision was made - a harsh crackdown on the churches of the city. In place of the Cathedral of Saint Sophia, an administrative center would serve as a capitol and proletarian temple.\n\nThrough many days and many nights, thousands of workers stripped the Cathedral bare, seizing manuscripts and relics. Dynamite was placed in halls now silent, without sermons or believers to listen. The observer of the glory of Kievan Rus and the Golden Freedom of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth held its breath expectantly.\n\nLazar Kaganovych arrived at the scene, and other government officials made sure to capture the image of him speaking to workers and planners. But the speech he would give to all assembled would reveal the full scale of his ambition. How small and miserable this one church looked to his planned creche of socialism!\n\n"Comrades-Brothers! Comrades-Sisters! The present socialist Kyiv is the cradle of communist society, should it become a historical milestone of Ukraine, a guiding star on the path of our development. Therefore, I am deeply convinced that all peoples of the globe in our era, and all mankind of future centuries, will accept with satisfaction and joy the total reconstruction of Kyiv, tearing down the last shackles of oppression that feudal-tsarist rule laid upon us! It will bear the triumph and pride of the heroic victories of present generations for centuries, and millions of people who are selflessly devoted to the cause of communism will see the fruits of their struggle and their labor in this celebration. This Cathedral will be torn down! And on its bones, a wonderful Palace of Labor will be built! This will be a testament to my... your... the hard work that we are doing today!"\n\nA gathered crowd of laborers, enlightened ex-priests, and other citizens started to clap, cheer, and shout the name of the communist titan Lazar. He raised his hand to the sky - to forward! - and a grand explosion rocked the streets of Kyiv. Holy wisdom was no more, and in its place, socialist wisdom would be built. The Palace of the Rada, a new parliamentary building, was to be constructed in a combined art deco and futurist style owing to the scraps of Semenko's Komunkult. But the Great Leap Forward was only beginning, and many would soon know the new name of the old city. The new face of the capital of the red kingdom was announced not long after that."

Would the new incarnation of Babeuf sentence him as an example to the insufficiently committed?\n\nPolicemen slowly advanced on Comrade Semenko's building. Officer Kuzma of the Ukrainian Commissariat of Revolutionary Messages, with his immediate superior Kazymyr, was assigned to arrest the poet and bring him to the car outside. He did it with difficulty because, unlike Captain Kazymyr, time and good eating had done their work to his physique.\n\nOf course, his compatriot called down from a flight above. "Hey piggy, If you hadn't had those two beers before work and some more sausages, maybe you could get here sooner."\n\n"Yes, yes, Captain Kazymyr," Kuzma groaned between breaths. "You could take some time out of respect for your elders, especially as this shitty poet isn't escaping the flat any time soon."\n\n"Don't talk so loud and get your ass up here," boomed the young man.\n\nSemenko, inside the apartment, was finding even mental escape eluded him. He was supposed to lead the new generation of a renewed party, to be the commander of the revolution. But it was not him, but Kaganovych, who possessed the fire that would consume the whole world. There was no room for the two of them in what remained. There was one last gesture that could memorialize what he was. So the young revolutionary was hunched over his desk, preparing a final poem.\n\nOutside the door, Officer Kuzma pursed his lips and turned to his boss. "What if he has a gun?"\n\nKazymyr, stretching in preparation for forcing their entry, shrugged. "Then we will just shoot him and that-"\n\nBut a sudden boom from the apartment interrupted him. With a knowing nod, Kazymyr pressed the doorknob. The door opened, and the two entered, guns drawn. The desk opposite the door was unoccupied, yet something seemed to have painted the wall behind it a deep red. Kuzma saw his superior  check behind the furniture, wince, and turn something over with his foot to look at it before letting out a chuckle.\n\n"Hah! The problem solved itself. Comrade Kaganovych will be pleased. And what does he usually say? No man, no problem. Yes, that's how it goes."\n\nKazymyr turned to look with a derisive smile at the blood-splashed wall, but Kuzma walked over to Semenko's desk and saw a scrap of paper covered in ink and the same red secretion. With a trembling hand, he picked it up. It was a poem, or some fragment of one. You could say it was an epitaph. He read it to himself quietly."

They bombarded him with questions about the shiny new tractor he was operating on the kolkhoz. How big was it? How fast was it? How many fields could he sow with it? And many more. He couldn't answer them all but tried as best as he could to describe them.\n\n"Well, my children. It's painted with red polish that shines in the sun and it's fast as lightning.

Calling from the kitchen while fixing a little pre-dinner snack for him, as per usual. Lazar entered the kitchen and kissed his wife on the cheek and took away the plate with bread, pickles, sausage, and of course the dependable lard.\n\n"Thanks, Maria. I hope I'm not neglecting you by being out there all of the time. You don't want me to help you in the kitchen? I could... Hmm. I could crack some eggs? I think?" Kaganovych realized then that he actually didn't know where to begin.\n\nAnd yet, she smiled sincerely. "Sorry honey, but you can't treat a meal like your political enemies. Go and relax. There is still some time until dinner, and you are probably hungry after all that demagogy. And what if you tear apart the kitchen looking for enemies, hm?" What could have come across as bitterness from anyone else was merely black humor between the two, and despite how weary he was, Lazar leaned in to give a kiss before launching a strategic retreat to the living room.\n\nReclining across the couch, the party chairman busied himself with his appetizer. He was pleased with the taste of the lard - he swore it had been thin and tasteless under the fools who came before him. Yet another triumph of the productive forces... This brought him back to today's rally. Ukrainians from one end of the country praised his name, but that got Lazar thinking of bigger and better things. Imagine, a revolution that would sweep from one end of Europe to the other! He was somewhere in a deep thought about the road from the Russian Civil War to the present when Hypnos visited him and fell asleep.\n\nIn his dreams, Kaganovych saw nothing but further greatness. Billions upon billions chanted his name in a chorus that reached him atop the world, from where he could see men, women, and children following his example. Monuments were built in his name, and by his hand, and it was magnificent. It had all been for the people, yet would it be so wrong if he were their hero? As the bread and pickles settled in his stomach, Kaganovych found he was still hungry - not for food, but for what the Revolution could bring him. Surely pride goes before the fall, but with the destruction of Russia, their course had been vindicated. So a satisfied smile crept across Lazar's face - visible even to his wife, who figured she could delay waking him just for a few more minutes..."
