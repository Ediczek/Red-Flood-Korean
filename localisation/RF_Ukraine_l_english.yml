#Brief history
UKR_DESC_MENU:0 "대전쟁과 러시아 내전은 우크라이나인들에게 1918년 독립을 선포할 기회를 주었고, 그의 생존은 폴란드의 원조 아래 확정되었습니다. 하지만, 새 나라의 건립은 독립의 기회를 잡는 것 만큼이나 어려웠습니다. 우크라이나는 여전히 농경국가인 데다 주장하는 영토의 다수는 여전히 적의 손에 있으며, 일부에서는 크이우가 바르샤바에 있는 주인을 위해 페트로그라드에 있는 다른 주인과 거래를 했다고도 주장합니다. 더욱이 1932년 시몬 페틀류라의 몰락 이래, 신임 대통령은 우크라이나 안팎의 적들을 향해 위협스러운 태도를 취하고 있습니다. 위대한 음유시인 타라스의 아들들에게 이제 어떤 일이 벌어지게 될까요?"

#Leader descriptions
UKR_Symon_Petliura_desc:0 "시몬 Vasylyovych 페틀류라, the behated and beloved of many people, father of independence or sire of tyranny. Petliura is a man of many controversies, many backroom deals, many victories, and many successes, but also primarily of pragmatism. Unsuccessful in the Christian priesthood, he strove for being a priest of the Ukrainian nation: a just leader who will bring his fellow Ukrainians to the glory of socialism. His chance came when the state was born in the ashes of the Great War. The long battle with Russia, where his star rose through vigorous military action and cooperation with the Polish, was the beginning of his hard work to keep the Ukrainian spirit alive.\n\n After the war with Kolchakist Russia, Petliura was elected the first President of Ukrainian People's Republic on June 16, 1922. Admittedly, for all his heroism, the lessons he learned from watching the developing Polish state led him to certain conclusions about civilian politics. The President found himself seeking to emulate his friend Józef Piłsudski in governing. After his reelection in 1927, Petliura was ready to begin the centralization of power and transition to a regime similar to the Sanation, but unlike in Poland, his coalition in the Rada ruptured within three years and he was forced to not seek re-election in 1932. While his status as a war hero prevented any legal consequences from dogging him, he found himself only a spectator in Ukrainian politics.\n\nThis has changed once more, though who knows for how long. His successor Mykola Mikhnovsky, evidently having felt the same lure of power, was thrown from power, and Petliura once again took the mantle of a liberating hero in Kyiv. It is unclear whether he will herald a return to the old days, or step down to begin something new. For now, Petliura rules with the absolute power he has long believed he needs to return stability and prosperity to Ukraine - in preparation for the ultimate war against its Muscovite lords."

UKR_volodymyr_vynnychenko_desc:0 "Volodymyr Kyrylovych Vynnychenko is a patron saint of workers, writers, democrats, and utopia builders. For many more-orthodox Marxists he is a naive optimist promising sausage to swipe voters for the USDRP. To himself, he is something more - a dreamer, but not the only one. With his Nietzsche-influenced socialism and Marxist teachings, he wishes to create a patriotic yet harmonious state where all would live in peace with oneself, others, the state, and nature. His dreams began when he was just a peasant boy from a rural family, and he long aspired to help those around him in the struggle for freedom.\n\nHe and his colleagues from USDRP formed the Directorate that served as Ukraine's provisional government. Assuming that the socialist dominance of the first government would allow the general population to mostly vote for their preferred flavour of socialism, Vynnychenko was a vocal voice for democratic elections, and for a time he was correct.  During the parliamentary elections, the USDRP was dominant... for some time. Petliura's controversial nature revealed the gulf between the party's allies and their own factions was deeper than expected, leading to the rightist takeover of the government. Mikhnovsky, assuming his old allies would one day come for him, focused most of his ire and force on the USDRP while in power. He was not mistaken.\n\nPetliura's cooperation with the Poles to cast down Mikhnovsky had a price - his replacement with a less controversial but no less ambitious socialist. President Volodomyr Vynnychenko, having learned well from the last few years, has outlined the blueprint of a labour democracy arrayed against the rightist forces, viewing it as a necessary evil to preserve socialism in Ukraine. With this, the USDRP has once again become the main party of socialism in government. A grand campaign of anti-theistic and anticonservative reforms is planned to liberate the people from a decadent and stifling past and thrust them into a world where innovation is approved of. And so, another old hero of Ukrainian independence takes the stage, promising ecological reforms, a new collectivization of land, new workplaces - and of course, a new Ukrainian socialism."

UKR_lazar_kaganovich_desc:0 "Lazar Moiseyovych Kahanovych, an iron man of an iron heart and iron will - the unstoppable machine that will strike down the revisionists and enemies of the state. Kahanovych is not a visionary or a dreamer, but he is efficient. Born to a Jewish family near Kyiv, he participated in the Bolshevik movement through its most intense power struggles before the Great War. With the exile of his patron Vladimir Lenin, however, he would not leave the party, but instead advocate for cooperation between the "western" and "eastern" socialists to meet their common goals. When the fortunes of the revolutionaries began to falter in the Civil War, however, Kahanovych was sent back to Kyiv by the RSDLP in order to salvage something from the situation. With the independence of the Ukrainian state, he became a leading member of the newborn UKP.\n\nThough he would admit he found Semenko a fine poet, he had his own private concerns about the idealistic chairman of the party. Was a quasi-futurist iconoclast really the best choice to unite the communists? Still, he believed in what he had for decades - the necessity of a strong vanguard party to seize control of and transform the state. Mikhnovsky's crisis finally provided the opportunity, both for himself and the party. By positioning himself as the stable and competent alternative to Semenko, Kahanovych quickly became the unofficial leader of UKP, and when he broke the USDRP revolting against Little Napoleon Petliura and his goons, he made sure most of the defecting Esdeks came into his camp as he become a reincarnation of Babeuf leading a new red revolution and a new red terror.\n\nIn this way, he banished Semenko from his position and became the leader of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. Despite making no secret of his use of force, a good portion of the populace sees him as a stabilizing figure, both a champion of the downtrodden and a Ukrainian patriot. What is his goal, then, now that Kahanovych has the machinery of the state in his hands? Nothing less than the total transformation of the country, taking this backward state into a communist future. The price demanded by this task remains to be seen. The results, however, could be unfathomable."

UKR_semen_man_desc:0 "Mykhaylo Vasyliovich Semenko is a man of many obsessions, of many passions, and of many ideas - a prophet of cosmic communism free of outdated nationalisms and united in a proletarian avant-garde culture. A futurist from his earliest days, Semenko was raised as a poet and would-be visionary. Due to his charisma, organizational talent, and popularity, he was able to punch above his weight against the Old Bolshevik core of the UKP, believing them no less old-fashioned than the other parties. Making the pitch to become Chairman, Semenko embraced a different spirit. He saw that Ukraine was a creation of Tsarists to weaken the proletarian mind, nothing but an obstacle to science, art, and above all, communism.\n\nThe UKP under his tenure embraced a more Kavkazian model, rejecting nationalistic devations. For Semenko, Skyrypnyk and other fools were disconnected from reality or just opportunists who sought to secure their secures by waving the national flag. Of course, the fervor with which he attacked the old guard was not without controversy, sending to many fleeing into Kahanovych's hands and the "Independent" wing of the party. Perhaps it would have doomed him, had Mikhnovsky's fall and the USDRP's search for allies not given him a route to control over the country. Dissatisfied with Vynnychenko's vague utopianism and Petliura's authoritarianism, many Esdeks were receptive when Semenko reached out to promise a true form of socialism.\n\nAnd so, Semenko cemented the rule of the UKP, and now he sets his sights on the opposition, purging the rightists with no mercy and pushing for absorption or illegalization of the other leftist parties. Together with his lieutenants Khrushchev and Volobuyev, the plan is no less than the total reconstruction of Ukraine, leaving not an inch of grass on the ground, the landscape filled with man-made metal constructs touching the very skies and striving for the stars. A union of proletarian struggle and a poetic aristocracy prepares to complete a revolution from above and below that will forge a new liberated realm of workers."

UKR_mykola_mikhnovsky_desc:0 "Mykola Ivanovych Mikhnovsky, if nothing else, is one of the grand old men of the Ukrainian independence movement. Even in those decades where most of the nationalists were concerned with cultural autonomy within the Russian Empire, the young student of Kyiv University yearned for more. With an upbringing rooted in Cossack heritage and full of folk songs and literature, he aligned with the Taras Fraternity, which advocated for a free Ukraine spanning between the Carpathians and the Caucasus Mountains.\n\nIt all might have come to nothing if not for the Great War. In the early twentieth century, even the independence movement was politically divided, and Mikhnovsky's militant actions maxed out at the occasional destruction of Russian monuments in Ukraine. The outbreak of the war saw him alternate between frontline service and working in military courts, but the growing instability of the Empire finally gave him the opportunity he was looking for. Mikhnovsky joined other nationalists in the declaration of an independent Ukraine in 1918, though executive power would always slip through his grasp. While Symon Petliura and the other military men of the revolution grew in power, he found himself an uneasy parliamentary ally of the USDRP as a last resort.\n\nThe first decades of a free Ukraine were a mixed blessing. The frustration of nationalist ambitions in the east and west burned bright in his heart, and his appraisal of Petliura's clique as inexperienced radicals never quite diminished as factionalism in the Rada continued. Mikhnovsky also became one of the more respectable faces of skepticism to the Intermarium, publicly voicing concerns that Ukraine had traded one political and economic master for another, continuing their domination by Poles and Jews. His final break with Petliura in 1930, and the failure of the governing coalition to limp on with the support of the far left, eventually saw him become President in 1932. After four years of ratcheting up rhetoric against Warsaw and national minorities, there are concerns that Mikhnovsky may be a prelude to the Intermarium tearing itself apart, if Ukraine does not do so first."

UKR_batko_nash_desc:0 "스테판 Andriyovych 반데라 is a manifestation of unmatched power of nature, an avatar of young passionate anger, and the Providnyk of the Ukrainian nation. That this is hardly an exaggeration of the young man speaks volumes. He was always ambitious, quickly becoming second or third in the hierarchy of Ukrainian nationalists on the strength of his conviction and boundless energy. However, unlike Konovalets or Melnyk, Bandera grew disillusioned with the old breed of Ukrainian nationalist thought, and like many other youth in the organization was radicalized by Dmytro Dontsov. Unlike the rest, however, he had enough willpower to act on what he had learned. Bandera vocally opposed the cooperation with Poland that the other "mainstream" nationalists could tolerate, pointing to the history of Ukrainian oppression under Polish overlordship, not to mention the ongoing occupation of Lviv. His involvement in border tensions and nationalist action led to his public profile growing as something of a young hero who could put action to his wishes.\n\nWhen he called for a quest of vengeance that would be remembered through the ages, his voice was not alone. Some aspired to this bloody quest in their own way, some feared it, yet others would join Bandera in his cause. The years after Ukrainian independence failed to live up to lofty expectations, after all, and soon the quarrels of Mikhnovsky and Petliura seemed another albatross around the nation's neck when the real threats advanced on Kyiv. What did it mean for Ukraine when the mad dogs of the UDP and USDRP were only barking at each other while the Russian, the Judeo-capitalist, and the Judeo-communist were at the door?\n\nWhen Petliura called for help from OUN, he expected that they would sit down and negotiate, concessions would be made, and he would resume ruling. It was not enough for OUN - no, the Ukrainian people, and Bandera himself. He struck down the old gods of the Kyivan Olympus, and sustained by the anger inside of him, he led the Ukrainian revolution to its conclusion. And so, a new national state has been born out of discipline and friendship among brothers. There are still many things to do to repair this broken country and to lead it to its natural greatness, but Bandera called for action, and the people heard him! Under the Providnyk, Ukraine will stretch from the Vistula to the Pacific, and nobody will stop this righteous crusade to the borders of the world!"

UKR_bohdan_ihor_antonych_desc:0 "Bohdan Ihor Antonych is many things, but if you asked he would tell you he is a life-loving bard singing the songs of rebellion against the old order. He might even tell you he is just one of many young nationalists who rose up in OUN to demand what was due to them. "Away with Christ and up with the true Solar God!" With the call put out into the wind, patriotic Ukrainians turned their heads to the sky and prepared to build a new Tower of Babel to meet it. From the ashes of a prediluvian past, young man, raise a glorious future!\n\nThe aftermath of the Great War and the persistent frustrations of Ukrainian self-government drove wedges into the broad front of nationalists. Some would confront the problems of Ukraine through newfound faith in communism. Some would find new interpretations of modernized Ukrainian nationalism. Few except Antonych and his friend Volodomyr Shaian considered turning their heads towards the past - but it would not be to Russia, or even Kievan Rus as it was known. Antonych and his clique would instead call back to the ancient civilization of Oriys, builders of the first Ukrainian state, who in centuries past waged war against the Scythians and Muscovites. Of course, this was considered pseudohistorical by most, but some artists, architects, and most importantly peasants would find something evocative about the theories. Could a church covered in gold and with a history of servitude to Moscow have all the answers? Or did Ukraine require a delve into the primeval and esoteric?\n\nPetliura called desperately to the heavens for help, and what descended was not an angel of the rabbi Yeshua but rather one of Dazhbog - the true god of the Ukrainians - that would chase the old nationalist away from Kyiv. Antonych showed the new generation the way to the city's gates, and with divine inspiration they proclaimed a new beginning and a new rebirth. A war is coming, the swords of the Ukrainian state arrayed against all that is tired and apathetic, and at the front of the vanguard is Antonych, the guiding light into the future and past."

President Mikhnovsky needs your help, as communists and Poles try to subjugate our beautiful nation to their interests. He has dissolved the Rada for the good of our country as we enter hard times, as hard solutions are required to preserve Ukrainian independence. And so, if you desire what is best for the country, we call upon you! The challenges ahead are great, but a purified national republic awaits after them."

UKR_oun_thorn_desc:0 "The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists is made up of nationalists like us... but unlike us they are naive, untested, and advocating for a great upheaval to turn Ukraine into a modern country. For all our interests overlap, we need to keep an eye on them, or else their youthful energy could be exploited by the communists to destabilize our republic. We can cooperate for now, but we must be prepared to cast the leadership into the dustbin of history and absorb the more malleable men from their ranks."

UKR_check_oun_activities_desc:0 "The OUN is ultimately a mob, destructive without even grasping what they destroy. They don't understand that a truly effective pogrom must be surgical, and not some conflagration that alienates citizens and destroys our infrastructure. The new Ukraine must place a firm hand on this nationalist form of anarchy. Certainly, Jews have no place in Ukraine and should be eradicated as a threat to the Ukrainian race... but we are smarter than this. No truce with the Organization."

We cannot allow them into a government, but they are an excellent reserve of militants against the trade unions, Poles, Jews, Russians... It is time to get ourselves a slavering attack dog. By giving the OUN a small influence over our internal security we will buy their loyalty, and that loyalty will pay for itself in securing our state."

We can't, of course, let him into government, but him disappearing suddenly would enrage his supporters in the army. So while we keep him at arm's length from actual administration, we should publicly praise him. He is a Hero of Liberation! ... that is, merely a symbol, and he should be left in this form, as a puppet we can take out of the closet when we need it."

This is a knife at our back, and we need to take pains to ensure it does not find itself sinking into us. While we will preach militarism, as we need brave young men to defend our country, it is time to publicly take a side against a political army and limit their influence. It was a mistake to include them within our Rada, but that could be said about every part of our democratic and old system."

The USDRP is an openly Marxist party, for one, and likewise the UPSR and UKP work against the interest of Ukraine. Even if the USDRP's leader, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, calls for Ukrainian social democracy, a small step and a great leap to communism both eventually lead to the same place. The inhuman system is alien to the Ukrainian spirit of liberty and tradition. We can approve of Petliura as an ideal to strive for, and even cooperate with him in government, but the USDRP must be suppressed."

Eser communism and Bolshevik communism are no different, both being heresies to Ukraine that threaten the nation from within and ultimately answer to German overlords. The Internationale, whether Second or Third, has no place in our national republic. Even if the UPSR presents itself as a party of Ukrainian workers and farmers, their true intention is to fuel German imperialisms, and they must be denounced. The UKP on the other hand openly preaches international cosmopolitan revolution and should be outright banned!"

Communists from Kavkaz, Poland and Berlin are quietly undermining the whole nation to incorporate us into their masters' plots. And who is the most obvious mastermind of our subjugation if not Poland? First, we ban the unions, a traditional bastion of red subversion. After that, there is no reason for us to safeguard Poles from our patriotic supporters. They should be allowed to flee if they desire, but there should be no price for acting against such vermin. Their homeland is behind the San."

We allow private property and shy away from communist excess, but our party is allowed to learn from Bismarck's example in designing our new socialist order. This Prussian face of Ukrainian Socialism is a good representation of what we want to achieve. We will strive for a White Revolution and Red Reaction.

We have abolished the democracy that holds back our country and we have already prepared the paperwork to exit from the Intermarium - or really a Polish Internationale.

And look, he didn't even know what hit him, with an entire structure built under his nose. His arrogance blinded him to the coup developing, as well as how much he had undone in Ukraine through his rule. And now, our first task is to rebuild after the destruction he left. Unfortunate, but we must start somewhere."

UKR_reassure_intermarium_desc:0 "We have to let the Intermarium know that the situation is under control before anyone does anything too rash. While we have our disagreements with Poland, a sense that civil order is breaking down might prompt Poland to send in the army... or worse, Russia to invade. For what it is worth, Polish money helps fund our development, and the other countries of the Intermarium share defensive priorities. Hopefully, with a sense of order and calm pervading, Polish traders will return and Belarus will open its borders to our exports."

There is a concern that they might do something in reaction to their President being removed from power. Why wait? Building Mikhnovsky's black legend begins now - to paint him as one of the worst things to happen to this country in living memory, and a tragedy we narrowly averted. Supporters of him should be stigmatised and encouraged to keep their complaints private. Let them be denounced with the same tones as we do the OUN!"

UKR_calm_the_hardliners:0 "Calm the Orthodox"
UKR_calm_the_hardliners_desc:0 "Vynnychenko and communists are noticeably anxious about Petliura returning to power once more. They should not be. There is nothing to be scared of. Petliura is simply the head of the provisional government that will manage Ukrainian affairs before we call elections. It won't be long at all - Mikhnovsky's recent escapades were thankfully brief enough that cleaning up after him won't take a generation. Petliura will surrender his powers once he no longer needs to worry about safeguarding democracy... probably."

The spectrum of legal Ukrainian parties, like the OUN, UNDO, UPSR, UKP and of course the USDRP, can come together to announce a return to business as usual. We don't know what the future will hold for our dear country just yet, but we can say that we hope that it's a bright one. The abolition of Mikhnovsky has cleared the road to walk into the future of the Ukrainian state."

We say, an end to it! Not with words but with a hatchet and an axe in our hands. We will not only purify our motherland, but bring it a true revolution, of not only the social conditions but also of the spirit. A new beautiful order will arise from the embers of old Ukraine in which we will strive and develop in eternity for the glory of our people and our race. Long live Providnyk Bandera, as he will lead us to a greatness free from Petliura's opportunism and Mikhnovsky's idiotism! Bandera is the only person in this country who we can call a father - no one apart from him."

UKR_a_revolution_of_discipline:0 "A Revolution of Discipline"
UKR_a_revolution_of_discipline_desc:0 "Many revolutions, especially socialist ones, are disorganised and chaotic. Rather than turn the world upside down, we want to maximise the vital forces of our nation and unite them, with a metal grip and a discipline that will make us stronger than ever. We do not promise a revolution of love, but rather hate: the strongest emotion in the human body that can unite people under one great goal. This goal is the rebirth of Ukraine, and this can be only done in a centralised disciplined hierarchy, not a naive anarchist commune or international judeo-bolshevik state."

UKR_a_revolution_of_friendship_desc:0 "We do not wish to bring only cruelty and pain to our people in the name of some unobtainable ideas. We want them to bring friendship - camaraderie and unity. In these hard times, it is necessary for us to carry out dramatic reforms and policies that will make the lives of common Ukrainian men, women, and children better. This can be only achieved in a society bound not by fear but rather of friendship focused on helping your fellow Ukrainian neighbour. This is our goal, a state should be a friend for our people and our people should help each other. This is what we want to achieve for all Ukrainians from Vistula to the Pacific."

UKR_an_ukrainian_revolution_desc:0 "This is not a revolution of workers, of peasants, of humanity. This is a revolution of something more great and more beautiful than any theorycrafter could imagine, this is a revolution of action, of bravery, of violence - a truly Ukrainian revolution pointed against the slaves of Moscow, of Warsaw, of communist Berlin and of capitalist Washington. Every Ukrainian heart is full of righteous hatred against those who deceived and enslaved us, it's the end of this nonsense! Stepan Bandera wishes to direct and forge this hatred into a new Ukrainian state more glorious than anything we have ever created : a true monument to the blood of innocents killed by invaders and to those who fought back against the hordes of east and bandits of the west. Bandera, after dealing with the fiercest and the most aggressive opposition that wants to hold us down, can now start to forge a New Ukrainian State."

UKR_a_new_ukrainian_state_desc:0 "We can't just count on the zeal of our men, as it will soon extinguish without a proper structure to keep it alive and burning like thousands of suns. The new Ukrainian state must balance freedom with authoritarianism. The mistakes of the so-called "Labour Democracy '' show that we can't make this mistake for a third time, first with Petliura, then Mikhnovsky. OUN must be better than these goons that divided our people. An introduction of equal suffrage with the freedom of press should be carried out with authorization of the state. OUN should be the only party, but we can't allow ourselves to be closed for critique as we will degenerate like the prior regime. A balance between freedom and responsibility is a key to Greater Ukrainian Nationhood."

UKR_under_the_lead_of_providnik_desc:0 "Stepan Bandera is a young leader with a fiery and passionate heart who wishes nothing but goodness for his people. He has become the face of Ukraine: hard, soldierly, and brave. He is a natural born leader and compassionate man who sees the pain of the neglected, poor, and forgotten. His ethics and virtues should be praised in songs of Kobzars and children should aspire to be like Batko Bandera. A cult of our leader should be established in schools, entertainment and in the workplace. A face of Bandera should be on every street and on every wall so everyone seeing him will try to aspire to his greatness and strive for the betterment of our homeland as he does. It is not a mission of only Bandera but of all the Ukrainian nation. One man can't change the world alone, even one as great as our young Providnyk."

UKR_castes_of_national_rebirth_desc:0 "A feudal system was not only defective but also oppressive; there were, however, good ideas enmeshed in it. Envision a hierarchy in which a new kind of aristocracy will rule over the workers and peasants benevolently, to shelter and care for the lower strata. This aristocracy won't form out of the law of birth, but rather the law of talent and wisdom. Workers, peasants and other classes will live in a hierarchical but equal society formed as a national collective. Accordingly, we will strive to collectivise private property in the name of the greater Ukrainian struggle for nationhood and empire, from the Vistula to the Pacific."

We should weaponize this zeal and use it against our enemies. True terror should be unleashed against those who wants to destroy us, not limited to their soldiers but against the resources they use to make this war. We should encourage the will to fight of our partisans - members of paramilitaries should be integrated within the Ukrainian Army so our army will have an ideal to strive for. And of course, this will help us banish the remaining loyalty to Petliura from our army."

Even the best armament cannot stop a man who is furious about injustice someone has dealt against him, his family, and his cause. We should rally our faithful men and women, not only to the army, but as a separate unit to deal with our enemies directly. These brave units would be assigned to deal with partisans that can't be fought as one does a standing army. Of course, they would also administer the whole population under our control as we expand, and carry out the process of Ukrainization of these lands."

UKR_just_like_cossack_ancestors_desc:0 "We were the descendants of cossacks, a class that escaped to the wild lands of Ukraine from the Polish lords that wished to enslave us like some kind of subhumans. Cossacks were peasants, poor nobles or merchants - a family of men united by their fates who wished for nothing but freedom. This libertine spirit should be revived, and we should once again start colonising steppes, bringing civilization to its expanse in the name of ourselves rather than a foreign tsar or lord. Our military doctrine should represent this. After all, we expect to be fighting on the steppes and flat terrain of Russia, but also the greater Euroasiatic steppe where our brothers are enslaved."

UKR_a_new_ukrainian_sovl_desc:0 "Our mortal shell is only a tip of the iceberg which is the human. Our souls, our thoughts, our passions, our fears, our desires are what form our very being. And we must be blacksmiths of human souls and of their desire. Their thoughts should be centred on the well-being of our nation, as an interest of the nation correlates with the interest of the individual. A man can become better and stronger if he works in the name of his homeland. We should craft a man out of an iron body and iron will that won't be destroyed by any kind of weapon, physical or mental. This should be a model body and mind of every Ukrainian. We will spend more of our budget on overall preparation for military service for all of our population but also we will strive for universal qualitative education for everyone no matter what family they come from."

Mikhnovsky created a theory of Ukrainian race but in his stupidity and egotism he couldn't admit that he betrayed this race. Our blood should be precious like gold, and it cannot be sold as something cheap. We must push it to the limits, and destroy those who want to sell our struggle cheaply in the name of quick romance or betraying the homeland. Ukrainian men should love only Ukrainian women and nothing more, nothing less. From this relation there should be Ukrainian children that are learning in Ukrainian schools about Ukraine and Ukrainian values. We will strike down every interracial marriage that destroys our country from within, and burn it out as though it were a disease below the skin"

UKR_spirit_of_christs_antiquity_desc:0 "Ukraine is a Christian nation - there are some Ukrainians who don't believe in God but share Christian ethics with the rest of the nation. But there were some disturbing tendencies in our political sphere, even within OUN. Antonych and his fool Shayan wished to revive Slavo-Aryan paganism in a "Nietzschean" light. There were also attacks from the radical left who saw our faith as a beacon of reaction. In a sense, both understood a problem, but not the solution. We cannot remain only in the past, but we must not destroy what our ancestors knew as the basis of our nationality. A perfect Ukrainian is no different from his ancestor - a Kievan warrior and a cossack rider, but also a knight of Christ and only under Christ can we be successful. Not under the banner of godless Bolshevism or childraping Zeus, Perun or other idiotic pagan gods."

We wish for discipline and a fraternity for them, but also for free time and social benefits so they will not tire of working toward the glory of Ukraine. We must safeguard the rights of Ukrainian citizens and defend them from external threats. We will guarantee the rights of workers so they will support us and not communists who wish to destroy Ukraine in the name of cosmopolitan revolution. We will guarantee the freedom of thought and religion for all Ukrainians.

Bounded by this we can live and strive for things bigger than ourselves. This can be only achieved through nation and nation alone - religion, press, party, doctrine, ideas, all are only a component of the national struggle.

Russians, Belarusians, Balts, Turks, Mongols, Poles, they all will fear our revenge and our soldiers, taking revenge for the rape of Ukrainian women and slaughter of Ukrainian children.

With the death of the old man, we are now free to strike down their small experiment in Minsk and set free our Ruthenian brothers. This is sure to spark a reaction in Warsaw... and we are prepared for it, but if Belarus wishes to resist, we will cut open their ribs and tear out their black hearts for the glory of Ukraine."

Escaping to wild lands he sparked a rebellion of other men thirsty for justice. He made some mistakes that we feel to this day - he allied himself with Moskals and Russians to this day use him as an argument that our ultimate ambition is to unite with our "brother." But brothers don't kill brothers and enslave their women. No, Russians were never brothers to us, and we should show that once and for all. Arguing the Moskals out of their delusion that Khmelnytskyi did not want a free Ukraine cannot be done with tea and cookies - no, only with naked steel and the sweat of men."

We will drive them out beyond the Vistula where they will be under our mercy. The memory of Poland will be wiped out and Poles once again divided.

But in these lands, Ukrainian blood was spilled as Stolypin and other Russians sent our brothers to die labouring on the frontier. Those lands now aren't really dominated by any nationality - after Kolchak's disaster, many tribes once again could fight back Russian colonisation attempts, and our brothers intensified efforts to preserve Ukrainian culture so far from home. What this means is Siberia has no underlying nationality to unite it against us. They wish only for a peaceful life and nothing more, but they are alien to us and they should be civilised or driven out from territories where Ukrainian blood was spilled."

If this failed experiment wasn't already destroyed by the boiling forces within we will end it and destroy the last bastion of Russians and of their imperialism.

We will return to the collectivized land and socialised workplace. It will be, of course, a slower process to not disturb organic development of socialism with unnecessary revolution and disruption. In these steps, we will bring Ukraine to a bright socialist future without immediately impoverishing the people."

Humans should live in a union between nature and civilization, between collective and individuality. Life should be based on cooperation rather than conflict and this should be the basis of our society as well. When Ukrainians stop fighting each other, they can focus on creating a better state for themselves. An interest of an individual thereby naturally correlates with the interest of many."

Disenfranchising the big landowners and confiscation of their land will be a key to continuation of socialism in Ukraine.

With a hand extended to the Russians in our new expanded state, we will resist the compulsion to become a new Stolypinite empire of resettlement and oppression, but we will welcome back every Ukrainian that was banished from their homeland to the faraway territories of Russia.

ukraine.1.desc:0 "The last bastions of the red stars were open, stars shining bright on the uniforms of partisans fighting against a tide from the west. Could they ever have believed the Ukrainian thirst for vengeance would reach so far? They brought with them only axes and hate in their hearts, and it was enough to lead a crusade against the Russians of all Eurasia - Tsarists or Republicans, it was unimportant. Bandera, their Providnyk wished only for one thing - blood to repay the pain inflicted for centuries. This radical rebirth was a fundament of new Ukrainian destiny, one that could never be described as merely "hohol" or Small-Russian. Independence and empire were now non-negotiable.\n\nBut for now, against a red and black tide, the partisans fought for survival over utopia. The repurposed church had served well as a shelter, but only so much ammo could be stored. Another attack, and they were falling back to another meager line, but this time was different. The partisans saw a man - no, two of them - leading the assault. With a supernatural fervor, the nation that had gone from triumph to triumph shook their numbers with a glorious shout that seemed to rise in one voice.\n\n"SLAVA UKRAINI"\n\nSome were able to escape for the forest. Others took up residence in the church tower. The Ukrainians abandoned restraint and fired machine guns into the structure, until the final redoubt was scattered with corpses as red as the stars on their uniforms. One of the two who commanded the charge slapped his comrade on the back and finally broke the tension. "Bloody mess they made, isn't it?"\n\nHe replied: "Indeed, my friend, but it is one of the last fires we'll be putting out. Come with me! We have one last job to do before we move on to the next struggle!"\n\nThe two opened the trap door to the roof of the church, bearing a colourful flag with which they would  proclaim a new pan-Ukrainian state. Stepan Bandera, and his new knight of Kyivan Rus Grigory Fajda, fastened the flag on the roof with all of their strength and looked out over the tide of cheering soldiers. Both heard the shout of the entire Ukrainian nation harmonized in a cacophony that could be heard from the second edge of the world."

This time he wasn't looking at a mountain of reports, but rather at the wine he had purchased as soon as the protests outside had disappeared.\n\n"You did it, Mykola," he whispered to himself, and felt a smile creep across his face for what felt like the first time since the crisis began. Out popped the cork, and soon a river of red was flowing into the fine glasswork he kept for meetings. Swishing the vessel around to aerate the contents, he raised it in a private toast.\n\n"For me, for Ukraine, and for the Ukrainian Race"\n\nA celebratory swig turned into emptying the contents in one smooth gesture. Perhaps this was what victory meant. He alone understood the state of the nation, and played all of his foes off one another with Machiavellian grace. Nothing could stop what was coming now - the Ukraine of his dreams.\n\nNothing would stop another glass, for that matter. Or another bottle. The catharsis of the last few months came pouring out. That old bastard Petliura was too late to push him aside like he did in the independence war. Half the communists were on the run. Even the OUN had seen reason, if the suppression of protests was anything to go by. Ha! He'd almost forgotten the newfound peace around his office. So what if his duty to Ukraine was far from over? To not celebrate would be a crime.\n\nAnd what a duty awaited. Standing up to Warsaw. Building a real army. Breaking the foe within and without. Hell, his story may as well have just been beginning, but at least the news of infighting from Russia was promising - for once, he would have time for his ambitions.\n\n...But even in his inebriated state, something else began to plague his mind..."

He rode to the city with his men under the cover of night, intent on avoiding any assassins lying in wait, but also hoping to quietly organize a parade for the next day, one declaring a Ukrainian empire from the Vistula to the Pacific.\n\nBy sunrise, the Providnyk wondered if perhaps the threat of rail sabotage would have been preferable, arriving at Harbin after a running battle against the Judeo-Bolshevik partisans of the RSDLP that made their bastion in the lonesome countryside. But with the help of local Ukrainians and peasants, the pigs were quickly found and hanged, or otherwise shot in their black rotten hearts. There had been casualties in his guard, but the enemy was running scared.\n\nHe rode down through the empty streets, but was flagged down by a man emerging from an alley. Bandera that first suspected a pitiable alcoholic, then saw he walked with a confident gait. Bandera ordered a torch lit to see the interloper - the face belonged to a young man, of a similar age to Bandera, even a babyface. The stranger spoke softly, but like a soldier with many years of experience.\n\n"Sir! I appear for duty. I was on my former mission when I heard you were coming. I have been waiting for you for a long time and am reporting for further service in the name of Greater Ukraine!"\n\nThe Providnyk frowned in confusion. He couldn't remember who this young lad was, but read no ill intent from him. Maybe indeed he had sent someone to Harbin among the Green Ukrainians to sow terror against the Yellow Russians? For this reason, he asked, "Who are you, young man?"\n\nThe stranger replied, saluting. "Fajda, Grigori! I was sent to Harbin to fight the Russians in order to liberate our oppressed brethren!"\n\nBandera gestured to his comrades to ask if they knew the man, but after some whispers, nobody knew who Grigori Fajda was. He replied: "I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are… but I see a great fire in your soul. If you are indeed a warrior of Ukraine, join our ranks! Together we will strengthen our domination over the world, but now I think you should rest. Buy yourself a good place in the inn and go to work. You will achieve great heights soon if you keep the same spirit."\n\nWith that, he threw a pannier to the lost soldier. Grigory opened it, seeing a package of suhara and hryvnia, but by the time he looked back up, the Providnyk and his men were riding off, leaving the young Ukrainian alone in the frost. The first words that came to mind echoed through Harbin's streets."

With these scandalous revelations, the army, the OUN, the UKP, and even the USDRP have withdrawn their support for the Ataman, and he was forced to step down from his position. We solemnly regret that the hero of our independence has fallen so far from his past glories, and hope to see justice done at the trial of Petliura and Mikhnovsky.\n\nThe immediate effect in the governing coalition has been severe. the USDRP's previous announcement that it would work closely with the UKP to restore order to our country was controversial, but the disgrace of Petliura has led to a grand exodus of politicians from the USDRP to its junior coalition partner under the leadership of Mykhailo Semenko. It appears that in light of this, the Ukrainian Communist Party will be leading the new national government.\n\nIn his address, Mykhailo Semenko announced that the government would continue the illegalization of all parties save for the USDRP and UKP. It's suspected that this is a first step towards bringing our governing model in line with the Kavkazian model. Stressing his commitment to the socialist principles our state was founded on, Semenko also was quick to draw attention to the poor living conditions in our cities under the previous Ukrainian governments. For now, it appears the incoming government will attempt to rectify this.""

ukraine.9.desc:0 "To no one's surprise, the President of Ukraine was controversial, but Mykola Mikhnovsky had perhaps exceeded his predecessors. This was precisely why he was up late at his desk, reviewing the report on the largest organizations opposing his declaration of martial law. The indignity of it all. Did no one else in this country see the hand of Poland behind the attempt to oust him, so soon after he decried their occupation of Lviv?\n\nThe first was his old adversary - the USDRP. He knew them very well: Judeospartakists, Polonophiles, traitors, led by Marshal Piłsudski's lapdog Symon Petliura and the sweet-talking Volodymyr Vynnychenko. Of course, both were foreign puppets. If he could just have Petliura shot for Polish collaboration it would have been done already, but being known as the father of Ukraine's independence shielded him. Vynnychenko was no better - a Berlin radical cloaked in innocent utopian naivety. A subtler touch was needed.\n\nThen there was the OUN, officially the biggest nationalist party in the country, unofficially Ukraine's biggest mental asylum. Yevhen Konovalets was almost bearable, the grandée of the old guard, but he was keeping a lid on a new generation of leaders. All of them ostensibly supported his temporary dictatorship, but Mikhnovsky saw his fears confirmed on the intelligence reports - the Banderites and the Knights saw him as a means to displace Konovalets. Stepan Bandera was a good patriot, but his men were practically terrorists, and Bohdan Antonych would probably go down in history as a national poet, but it was clear that "Knights of the Sun God" wasn't just a silly name for an artistic circle. Cultists and killers were his way into the party - not much of a choice.\n\nThe last was the Communist Party. Banned like the other opposition, of course, but arguably the most repulsive - Bolsheviks ready to serve their Moskal lords. The texts of Mykhailo Semenko, the current leader of the UKP, were especially repulsive - he wished to eradicate Ukrainian culture from the face of the earth! Shevchenko and Oles meant nothing to him! At least his rival Lazar Kaganovych felt some patriotic stirring against the Russians, but a pragmatist running the UKP was probably more insidious. One couldn't be arrested without alerting the other, and Mikhnovsky felt another decision developing.\n\nAt least the Social Revolutionaries and the liberals of UNDO were too weak, too paralyzed, or too supportive of him to matter. Yet the President was suddenly aware of how narrow a path he was treading."

If he could co-opt one wing, he'd have a gun pointed at the rest of the party - and of course, completely discredit them as collaborators if his scheme was revealed. He'd take them all down with his ship if he sank.\n\nStepan Bandera and his mentor Dmytro Dontsov almost seemed like natural allies, at least. Young republican revolutionaries, supporting a Christian spirit, ethnic nationalism, and a social form of the state. Two obvious problems presented themselves: Bandera was too obviously ambitious, and Dontsov's National Collectivism felt a hairsbreadth shy of communism or the Polish Sanation. The young firebrand was a diplomatic catastrophe in waiting too. Sending your greatest stalwarts to the Russian Far East after they were caught committing terrorism in Poland? Of course, everyone with sense hoped fervently for Green Ukraine to break the yoke of the Muscovites in Harbin, but was Bandera seriously considering adventures across Eurasia? Madness.\n\nBut speaking of madness, the alternative was the Order of the Knights of the Sun God under Volodymyr Shaian and Bohdan Antonych. Ancient Ukrainian civilization that warred against primitive Russians? Returning to paganism? Crimea as the seat of a hyper-advanced solar civilization? The rest of the OUN would flee to his side if the Knights somehow found a way to power. What a laugh. Of course, the less laughable matter was that Knights took inspiration from the French Carnalistes and Polish Zadruga. A promised realm of knights and a socialized economy sounded like the seed of a national tragedy for Ukraine, but ideally they were too alienating to become an uncontrollable threat against him.\n\nMikhnovsky scratched his head and glanced at the window across the room. It was dark outside, but he could see a small crowd protesting against him. It was a little smaller than yesterday, but that meant their ranks had gone underground. Better to catch the snake now than let hide in a burrow to strike. He scratched his head again, then his mustache, and slowly pulled out his official stamp to issue the order.\n\nHe finally decided.\n\n"

It took seconds in the office to wonder if he should have seen someone else instead. Gerbel barely got up from his chair, mainly with the help of one of Mikhnovsky bodyguards, and offered his interlocutor a trembling senile hand. Mikhnovsky gave him a firmer hug, and they both sat down at the table, while the President tried not to think of how soon he'd need to find a replacement.\n\n"So, let's get started," said Mikhnovsky as he produced the dossier on his communist rivals. Gebrel didn't react for a moment before he shook himself, glanced at the papers, and spoke quickly.\n\n"Yes! Yes... We should get started."\n\nThe President raised an eyebrow and continued, thumbing through the portfolio. "As... you know, Semenko is the current leader of the UKP. I dislike him more, personally, but that is a secondary concern. He is more of a Robespierre personality, I would say - naive and pure, a futurist poet and Proletkult remnant. I'm told his ambitions quite literally include space! So much love for the stars, and none for the motherland. The file will show we expect him to be in a major city, for ease of coordinating the party and just given his distaste for the countryside."\n\nGerbel nodded for entirely too long. "Okay. Great. Great... But what about the second person? What was his name? I can't remember..."\n\n"Kaganovych. His name is Kaganovych. Less of an ideologue, for a communist. He keeps it vague which side of the old Bolshevik movement he was a part of before he came home. Less popular within the UKP, yet potentially more dangerous. And why do I think that? Because he is less dogmatic than Semenko, easier to make allies. That, and I see a natural survivor when I look at him. One does not stay relevant to the movement for so long and through so many failures without being cunning. Even before my ascension, he was co-opting the old National Communists to his side. Now he is probably hiding somewhere among the peasants and operating from there."\n\n"Okay. Now I understand. Erm... To be perfectly clear, if we arrest one of them, the other side may gain more influence, right? Because the survivor will have more time to organize his faction... Right?"\n\nThat was what he took away from this? Mikhnovsky was sure that Gerbel didn't understand anything he said and all responsibility would be on his shoulders again. Still, outlining the case against each leader had finally provided him with clarity."

Mikhnovsky almost wished he'd been greeted with a fistfight, but he had no other choice. Even now, he knew he couldn't stop Petliura's ambition, but there were ways to tarnish the image of a national hero, at least to the people who mattered. If it just so happened that there was evidence of his duplicity out in the open, well... Petliura being a whore to the Poles was an open secret. A whore to the President, however?\n\n"Yes... Petliura. Can we cut the chit-chat and get down to business?"\n\n"Sure, but what do you want from me?"\n\nMikhnovsky wordlessly gestured down the hall, to the living room.\n\nSoon, the two old men were seated across from one another, Petliura pouring his foe a drink. The President swirled the vodka in his glass before speaking up. "I know that you conspire against me. And you know that I can't do anything against it. Apart from..."\n\n"Apart from what?"\n\n"Offering you a deal." He downed a not-insignificant portion of the drink before continuing. "What do you think about... taking some time away from politics? I offer you some funds and protection in this crisis, and you leave attacking me to the others. We both stay old heroes of the independence war, and nobody gets hurt.."\n\nPetliura was unreadable. The strategic picture was probably known to him, and the two both knew they weren't sitting across from a fool. "Sounds interesting. But what sum are we talking about?"\n\n"Let's say... Seven and a half thousand Karbovantsiv?"\n\n"Whoo hoo. That's a rather big sum. I don't think you have it with you now, do you?"\n\n"No. But I have a contract, and I will send a man to deliver the money to you tonight if you sign."\n\nThe gears were turning in Petliura's head. Nothing would stop him from breaking the pact after the money arrived, and he knew that. He knew that Mikhnovsky knew that, and vice versa. Old Mykola was crafty, but certainly desperate for allies.

The Ataman enjoyed too much respect in society to really fear an attack on his life, either out of respect or out of fear of creating a martyr, but if he wanted to go without bodyguards to overhear his conversation, there were certain prerequisites.\n\n"Well then, Vynny! Enlighten me. I have a difficult nut to crack, my friend."\n\nVynnychenko took his eyes off the trees momentarily. This had to be about the new government. He audibly groaned, and found his eyes locked on the ground as the two proceeded.\n\nPetliura's gaze narrowed. For all of his naivety, Vynnychenko was a different sort of politician to read. It was clear that his friend was carrying some sort of weight, his expression growing harder but more sorrowful all the same. Eventually, Petliura himself broke the silence - "What is it now?"\n\nVynnychenko finally voiced what he had buried since his colleague's fall. "You see, Symon, I don't know if Ukraine is ready for you to govern again. Our whole party was almost dragged into your plan last time. How do I know this walk is not some ruse or power play by you either, hm?"\n\nSo that was it, wasn't it? One last rupture with an ally? Petliura found himself angrier than expected as he rose to his own defense, before he could get a handle on it. "Vynny! Do not even suggest I'm another Mikhnovsky! Be more serious! What other party is prepared to rule other than the USDRP? I assure you... I'll find a place for you somewhere..."\n\nVynnychenko sighed deeply, wriggled his cowl, and looked into the sky. It all seemed familiar, didn't it? But another practical problem had come up now. "I doubt that the USDRP will be enough for you to rule the country if so. We can't go it alone once again - not a chance. The people will demand assurances."\n\nPetliura began to nod in understanding as the birdsong echoed throughout the park. Perhaps this could be salvaged. "How about the communists? Most of them are naïve, looking for someone to ally. If we incorporate the UKP into our government, perhaps it would be a solid Socialist-People's Front or whatever we'll call it..."\n\nVynnychenko didn't make eye contact, but something in his posture had stiffened. "And what if they are the ones who absorb us?"\n\nThe Ataman shrugged his shoulders. "That's when we'll worry, but tell me, what would you think of it?"\n\nHis dear friend Volodomyr rolled his eyes.

Without money and without support, there were too many uncomfortable questions to ask about the last few years.\n\nHe got up from his chair and shook hands with both Ukrainians, before crossing his arms getting down to business.  "Well, then, gentlemen... What brought you here to see me? The Ukrainian Embassy has rarely contacted us since Mikhnovsky ascended to the position of President. Would you like something to drink? Hmm?"\n\nThe Ukrainians were perplexed, but reasonably sure that Beck was toying with them somewhat. The head of the delegation spoke up:  "No... Thank you for your offer, however. Mr. Beck... We have come to ask for funds and support for the provisional government of Symon Petliura..."\n\nJózef closed his eyes and murmured - it was nice to be right. He opened them again after listening to his interlocutor's brief statement and showed them to their seats. They sat down in front of him and his tall desk, from which he looked at them with practiced superiority.\n\n"Petliura? So the scoundrel lives again. Good for him. Just tell me... What will you give us for this support? Even if our good old friend is in power... it was his mistakes that allowed Mikhnovsky to threaten our relationship in the first place. We can't throw money around left and right like this! Especially after the death of our Marshal..."\n\nThe Ukrainian nodded as a sign of understanding, then nodded a second time towards his companion, who silently opened a folder of documents. It didn't take long for Beck to gather what they were: a motherlode of intelligence on the activities of the OUN. The Banderites, the Order of the God of the Sun, the Old Guard. All of it. He was giving it a cursory look while the Ukrainian continued.\n\n"We knew that you, Mr. Beck, would suggest concessions... However, please consider the extent. Stepan Bandera and his thugs had Poles as their target before all else. He is charismatic. The same can be said of these madmen of the Order... The contrive to worship the Sun and preach the conquest of the Carpathians, which they hold as sacred land. If you hang us out to dry, the communists will profit, but if you make us look like fools, the OUN may."\n\nBeck snorted, though who about was anyone's guess. Bemusement? Incredulity? Appreciation for the intelligence efforts? The man himself certainly wasn't in favor of the communists, at least. Would it be enough?

In the name of a free Ukraine, President-Tyrant, you are under arrest."\n\nMykola did not know if it was a product of the alcohol, but in that moment, he felt as though he were onstage in some tragic play. After so much effort? After clawing his way back into power? He wanted to launch into a soliloquy, arouse the patriotic feelings of these soldiers, anything, but found himself only able to murmur. That is, until two swarthy officers grabbed him by his shoulders - then he found the clarity of feeling he was looking for.\n\n"Who sent you? Petliura!? Bastard! Hands off, cocksuckers!" After all the effort to entreat him, Symon had gone back to his old tricks, hadn't he? The walls were closing in, but Mykola wouldn't go quietly, not again. Before the curtain could fall, he turned and decked one of the soldiers in the nose.\n\nMikhnovsky's last ride had a certain nobility to it. Full of wine and indignation, the President managed to leap onto his desk, kicking wildly to avoid being grabbed by the other soldiers. In the fracas, the furniture quickly tipped over and brought him back to the floor, where he gave a good account of himself. The soldiers knew he had to be taken alive for the spectacle of a show trial, but it was turning the moment into a bloody farce. Eventually though, whether out of cleverness or sheer frustration, one of the soldiers snatched an emptied bottle of wine and broke it over his quarry's head.\n\nSo ended the last defiant charge of the Taras Fraternity. Mikhnovsky swayed unsteadily on his feet, took one, two steps toward his assailant, and plunged to the carpeting, completely unconscious.

As he spoke iconoclastic words about the reality of blood and genes, many viewers became uncomfortable. The professors sat down in silence.

The nationalists in the audience reacted strongly, getting up out of their seats to argue, and soon fists were exchanged. It then dawned on the student that OUN's takeover had perhaps been too recent for his thesis to be entirely without controversy.\n\nProfessors tried to calm the situation. The oldest one, in an act of bravery, even tried to stop two fighters, but the impact of a chair against his head and his body crumpling to the floor boomed out over the room.

More gunshots rang out, even what he was sure was a distant explosion, and what had started as a riot devolved into a battle for survival.\n\nEventually, wandering in a daze, the student found himself among the emergency responders, fearing to look behind him at the conflagration his thesis had ignited. The sights of evacuations of the wounded and dead, of police joining arms with nationalist students - what did this mean for his thesis? How Ukrainian blood was still dirty! How could this happen if we were united by race? His eyes, illuminated by the flames behind, turned to a page of his notes that he had been grasping through this whole escape.

He was spared from death and prison by Bandera, who saw him as useful. When they met, he saw a fire in the eyes of the young man, a vengeful one, or worse. His army career made him immune to intimidation, but Bandera didn't try to intimidate him, at least not openly. He felt that with every benign topic placed on the table, unspoken hate lurked behind it - though maybe not each one. They had talked about their favorite music, and how Stepan used to play on violin in duets with his pianist sister.\n\nBandera also asked about Piłsudski, which confused the old man. Oddly enough, Bandera seemed to want to emulate the old Pole. Not that he thought it was a bad idea; the Marshal was an old friend. He talked about their first meeting in Kyiv long ago, and the battle against the Muscovites. One day, however, Bandera cast a judging look on the old man during a war story, and spoke as surely as he ever did. "The greatness of certain individuals like Piłusdski or Kościuszko cannot change the fact that Poles oppressed Ukrainians, and placed a burden on them from the times of Casimir the Great. And even though these great men fought alongside our homeland, they still were enemies to our glory and independence. As dangerous as Russians."\n\n"This should be considered before you try to sell Ukraine to foreigners, don't you agree?"\n\nThe young radical's quiet intensity left the  soldier unable to respond, and then Bandera finally closed the jaws of his trap. He said that the old man would be allowed to stay free, but only as a symbol. The OUN was inspired by how he safeguarded Ukraine, but his crimes wouldn't be forgotten. That's how he found himself in a small cottage in the countryside, with no man to be his friend beyond his family, and watched carefully by passersby, any one of whom could be an OUN partisan. And so Petliura watched not only as his skin faded, but as the Ukrainian state grew on without him. They may build him a monument after he dies, but it will always be inferior to the statues of Banderites.\n\nWorse, he wondered how he could have averted his sentence, in a prison of his own making."

What should have been five minutes ended up being an hour long, but soon they arrived at the school. Yuriy noticed something strange. The crosses that indicated that the school was part of the church were removed. When Yuriy told this to Waldemar he noticed it too.

Most Ukrainians are Christians of some sort. Anyone else?"\n\nOleh's hand, a gnarly hand which Yuriy and the twins had been the victims of many unfortunate times, rose.\n\n"Ukraine is a country for Ukrainians! Stepan Andriyovych Bandera and the OUN are gonna kick out all of the Poles, Jews, and Russians that live here and drain our country like vampires."\n\nGasps and laughs emerged from across the classroom. The teacher was visibly displeased with Oleh's answer.\n\n"Now, those people are not vampires, young man." The classroom suddenly went silent. When teachers used those words, some kind of yelling was bound for the poor recipient of those words.\n\n"They're compatriots of Ukraine, just like you and me. Just because they're not of our blood or they don't worship the same God we do, doesn't mean they're not Ukrainians."\n\nOleh's face scrunched up like a piece of paper made into a ball, trying to comprehend the meaning of this statement. The teacher looked up from Oleh and began to address the entire classroom.\n\n"From today, your schooling experience will be free of the religious and national biases of the past. From today, we will learn to love everyone that lives in our country as our neighbor and not hate them, but embrace them as brothers and sisters. Have I made myself clear?"\n\n"Yes, teacher!" was the resounding answer."

However, for poor Myroslava, she had somewhere to be, and this huge crowd smack-dab in the middle of the capital city was just not going to cut it. The aspiring poet from the countryside had snagged her first big deal with publishers based in Lithuania, and she had spent weeks in preparation for this trip to Vilnius.\n\n"Excuse me! The park is opening! The park is opening!" shouted a streetside hawker. What the hell are you even selling? thought Myroslava as she shoved and pushed through throngs of human mass. Thirty minutes later she had finally made her way to the train station, but as luck would have it - or unluck, Myroslava thought bitterly - the train workers were on strike, and her train ride to Vilnius would be delayed indefinitely.\n\nThe young woman, disappointed that she had missed something so important, sat on a bench near the station, pondering her next moves carefully. Racking her mind, she decided to stay in a hostel run by a friend's relative from home while she tried to contact the publishers. "Hey!"\n\nMyroslava looked up. A little girl and her grandmother.\n\n"Are you speaking to me?"\n\n"We're going to the park! Would you like to come with us?"\n\nMyroslava wanted to laugh - this was her future! - but it couldn't hurt indulging in the wishes of a child. And that park might take her mind off of this striking nonsense for a bit.\n\nA short while later, they made it to the park. Although flooded with people, Myroslava couldn't be helped but be pleased by the calm serenity of nature. It reminded her of the countryside-of innocent times she had spent as a child, free to do whatever before her family pressured her to go to school and do proper things like getting an education. The seeds of a poem were germinating within her mind now. Myroslava grinned and swiped out her notebook, plopping down on a bench.\n\nShe had spent a fair amount of time in the park now, but Myroslava continued to write furiously. She hadn't been this fueled by the golden flames of imagination and creativity since news reached her that her elementary school teacher had died!\n\n"Hello?"\n\nMyroslava looked up. It was a young man, with Polish eyebrows and a short height.\n\n"What is your name? Mine is Peter." The young man's face was burning bright, and Myroslava could see his mates chuckling off on the other side of the circle. Before Myroslava could reply, "I propose that we meet here again tomorrow in the morning... I have something to tell you."\n\nSure?"\n\n"Okay!"\n\nAnd then the young man, apparently named Peter, ran off. Myroslava sighed. Just like this park, there were new things were happening all the time. At least tomorrow morning's "meetings" would not be in some stuffy coffeehouse, but in the open coolness of the newly opened national park."

Another spectator, an art professor, joined in the laughter and said.\n\n"As if Diogenes had said that! Look! I have brought you the Art of the Avant-Garde!"\n\nOne of the avant-garde artists heard the laughter and squeals of the laborer and the old-school professor. He stopped his conversations with his friends. He was generally unhappy with this crazy idea for an exhibition... but President Vynnychenko, for some incomprehensible reason, thought that Schevchenko's cultists would be able to appreciate real art... And this would somehow reconcile Ukrainians, blah! That's why they lined up both traditional, boring, and overcooked paintings next to futuristic and neoteric avant-garde paintings in the Khmelnitskaya art gallery. He clenched his fists and shouted in the direction of the workman and the professor. They all trembled, for his voice was like a bell.\n\n"You stupid philistines! I'll show you real art! Me!"\n\nWithout thinking, he began to walk up to the charming pictures of the landscapes of the Ukrainian countryside and punched a hole in them with his fist. His blows were so powerful that he also made holes in the walls. Crash! The torn painting shattered on his knee. Then, bang! The head of a sculpture of a Ukrainian peasant woman flew out of the window. The raging avant-gardist wanted again to throw some carrying words in the direction of the terrified professor....\n\n"And what, old man?! What will you do in the face of the destruction of your old worl-"\n\n...He was not allowed to finish when the landscape painter approached the avant-gardist at a rapid pace and smacked him firmly in the face. The avant-gardist laughed madly.\n\n"This is art! Battle, war, and blood on the pavement!"\n\nHe aimed a blow at the painter, but the latter blocked and slashed for the leg in return. But as befits an avant-gardist, nothing was sacred to him: he kicked for the crotch of the painter, who barely turned to deflect before throwing an orphaned easel. The horrified but equally curious audience watched the clash of the gods, the clash of tradition and modernity. No one knew who had the upper hand in this clash... and no one is likely to find out, for the security guards grabbed them by the scruff of their necks, like two little kittens who kept scratching each other. They separated the overgrown children and began to lead them both out of the room. After the great art that was the artists' battle, nothing remained but destroyed paintings, blood on the floor and an all-encompassing silence caused by the overwhelming shock."

What he wanted to announce wasn't something he was especially proud of, but he had done his utmost to prepare it for success. The threat of betrayal from within was gone now - leftist deputies, soviets, the army, the intelligentsia, and even some of the peasants gave him a commanding majority in waiting. That, and the rightists in government had already resigned in protest. The President cleared his throat to get the attention of the deputies, and started to read the Universal of National Unity.\n\n"Due to the immense acts of terrorism from the hands of rightists who threaten the development of socialism and the road to peaceful prosperity of the Ukrainian nation, I announce a ban of all organizations openly agitating against the proletariat-peasant alliance of our Republic. These include the so-called Union of Ukrainian Nationalists, the Security Service of OUN, various paramilitaries of OUN and its chapters, the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainian National Party, the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance, and other organizations that will be listed in documents distributed to the broader population."\n\n"Many among their number will protest, professing their own moderation. Certainly. But observe the mistakes of President Mikhnovsky - centrists can easily evolve into reactionary chauvinists left unchecked. The seeds of ultranationalism and hidebound conservatism thus cannot be tolerated in any form. I acknowledge the possibility of authoritarianism that this Universal carries, but I- as a socialist and Ukrainian patriot who wants nothing but freedom for my people, I believe that political plurality can be achieved without abandoning our goals of tolerance and enlightenment for all people. The radicals and those who cannot tolerate our tolerance should be met with their own medicine! Thank you."\n\nThe speech was short but everyone understood what was delivered to them. It was not particularly stirring. Some of the deputies clapped timidly, some of them just nodded their heads, and some even dared to whisper to each other. But for how little flourish the address had, the Rada was far from silent. Everyone could hear the shouts the as UNDO and the OUN began an impromptu demonstration. The last flailing of a headless chicken? Police and the military could keep them away from the Rada, and UNDO's leader Dmytro Levytsky tried to keep the disorganized mob peaceful, but there was only one possible result under these conditions.

No, but here he was, hopping off the truck he'd hitched a ride on. He started to massage his temples as he put the timeline together again. It was around thirty years ago? When the devil Stolypin exiled his father and mother he was only ten years old. He could finally return to his village.\n\nAnd how it had changed! New faces, and new buildings overgrowing the old thatch. Electric lines together with lamps, a nice road on which cars were moving slowly, and also a new school, in front of which children were running cheerfully. But what about... He headed towards his old family home to see what had happened. Admittedly, the repateiation office he contacted had set him up with a different plot of land, not that he could complain about it having access to the nearby forest. However, he was curious about what happened to his birthplace.\n\nSerhiy finally arrived and was surprised. Instead of ruin, it looked as though it hadn't changed since his youth. There was no one around except the old man sitting on the threshold, watching the horizon. The Ukrainian approached to make inquiries, but as he got closer, he found the man's face familiar. It was one of the few things he could recognize from his youth, before Kazakhstan. It was a Russian officer who had banished his family. The smile faded from his face. There was an expression of fury in his place. He pressed a word through his teeth.\n\n"You...!"\n\nThe old man jumped in surprise, initially confused, but the growing terror on his face spoke volumes. Of course. Why would a Russian officer be here of all places, lost in thought?\n\n"Please calm down, I made a mistake ... I'll make it up to you!"\n\n"How can you repay the years of starvation and freezing winters that I and my family needed to endure? My parents, wife, and my son died there, you Muscovite son of a whore!"\n\nThe old man wept, and Serhiy realized that his hands had started gripping the old man's shirt collar without much thought at all. How furious was he truly at this... wretch?\n\n"I... I know. I know I can't repent my sins of the past. My son died in the summer civil war and now I'm raising his children. I know what I did was wrong, but I didn't know it then. You don't need to forgive me, but I'm the only family they have now..."\n\nDespite himself, Serhiy was already releasing his grasp, rage melting off his face.

Some even ventured that 90% of the Polish economy was tied up in the syndicates, the state, or the public, and where did that leave room for an entrepreneur? Andrzej sighed, whether in relief or wistfulness about the future, as he unlocked the door to his new office. Soon he'd get his tools from the old shop, and then he'd be making a tidy profit on furniture again.\n\nStill, if the newspaper was any indication, it wasn't the promised land yet.

He would note with some wry satisfaction that, although he was too young to fight in the war, he had been immortalized in it anyway by a sculptor who had needed a model. He also saw Petliura's face on the leading statue - A Proof of the Infinite Humility of Petliura, he figured with a smirk. Still, Zynovij thought of Petliura as something of a father, to his men and perhaps the nation. Perhaps imperfect, like any father inevitably is, but ever working for Ukraine's interests.\n\nWhen Ataman Petliura pulled the sheet from the statues, he advanced to the podium to the accompaniment of thunderous applause from the audience - even from the veteran soldiers.

They are still there, watching keenly as birds of prey wait to strike. So what is our task, then, in preserving our freedom? Mikhnovsky had forgotten that our independence was won hand in hand with the Poles, and that we will need to stand together with our allies come a new war. If not, the red flood over Europe will drown us. I believe, however, that as a nation of heroes as far back as the Cossacks, we can create a country that will survive another thousand years!"n\nAnother wave of applause resounded through the whole square. Petliura gave an order to his aide-de-camp and soldiers. They stood in even ranks and prepared their weapons. Zynovij complied with the order, still thinking that he would like to shake Petliura's hand someday and meet him in person. However, those thoughts quickly evaporated as he and his squad aimed at the sky and everyone shouted "Sláva Ukrayíni! Heróyam sláva!" and fired a volley into the air, which was followed by the orchestra launching into a rendition of the national anthem, "Vichnyy revolyutsioner."

Shaian finally uttered a request, a single sentence to be carried to the very sun where Dazhbog ruled over the earth, a beseechment to the omnipotent of the universe, the same words the Knights greet one another with."

Many artists arrived to produce days of spectacle - a combination of holy practice with song that entertains. They were not alone, of course - peasants and other simple folk were called to display their local costumes, dances, and feats of strength. Even now, two young men stood against each other in a friendly fight. This duel of youngsters was watched by Ihor - a writer, poet, and journalist. He blew smoke from his pipe when suddenly he heard a familiar voice behind him. It was Oleg, the peasant with whom he had come to the festival from Kherson.\n\nOleg slapped a hand to Ihor's shoulder. "What's up, sir, in Tokyo? Do the commie Japs still hold the line?"\n\n"Ah, my dear friend, I've thought enough of Japanese people for the whole day."\n\n"But these are interesting things!"n\n"And who is curious? Do you even know where Japan is?"\n\nOleg grinned as though he were reciting worn wisdom to a child. "Well, far away, somewhere far away. But men don't know that the peasant with a peasant mind will be able to find any place, even if it is far away. And we also read newspapers here and we know everything."\n\n"Why be interested in this? I think in your community the world is wide enough for you. Let the whole world be at war, as long as the Ukrainian countryside is quiet, no?"\n\n"We embrace the world ourselves. And you know, we have more ambition than you think, sir. Spoiling for a fight too. Oh, I think we could beat the Russians and take back the eastern shore, but the lords are afraid of both the Russians and us peasants!"\n\nAt the sound of Oleg's words, Ihor grunted, let out smoke from his pipe again, and then began to slowly nod his head several times before he answered.\n\n"There may be some truth in these words, my friend. If a Ukrainian beside a Ukrainian were not a wolf, but a brother, maybe we would have regained our lands already in 1920."\n\nOleg smiled and patted Ihor on the back. Together they watched another performance, this time a musical duel between Providnyk Antonych and his ballads, and a daredevil who dared to challenge the great poet. The two friends eventually had to return to Kherson, just as the performances had to come to an end behind them, but the message, conveyed by days of elegant simplicity, was carried across Ukraine."

It will take time to achieve the level of technology worthy of our roots, but now we can say that Eurasia has become one - under a united Promethean front of Aryans."\n\nThe text was published, printed, and distributed around all of Kyiv and other city centers to announce a great victory against the ancient Muscovite traitors of blood. Yet mercy was given to these brother-killers, as Russia is to be enlightened by the Intermarium's grand crusade against barbarism. Now a grand building eclipses the whole sun and becomes the sun itself, shining brighter than thousands of galaxies. Orly Hora - Eagle Mountain - is a mighty structure meant to harness the technological strength of the state in a primitivist style. In the manner that Ukraine transfigured itself, the nation has perfected this gigantic mausoleum to national achievements.

Whole families of Ukrainians in traditional clothing and neopagan jewelry welcome them, and together they walk through the structure, one group after another, each vision more breathtaking than the other. A testament of Ukrainian Nietzschean vital energy, craftsmanship, and heroism, and all the blood that was spilled to create this monument. Only inside is its other purpose revealed - Orly Hora serves as a temple to the mighty sun god Dazhbog, who reveals himself in many faces, but made the Ukrainians his chosen people.

A call had gone out, one to lead them toward a new world and new culture that could reach into the sky and strike down the moon itself. They raised their hands, holding the artifacts of the old Ukraine - books of Kobzars, poems of Shevchenko, crucifixes, and flags! Tools to manipulate people, mere idols that subjugate the passion to the oppression of capitalism, all were hurled into a bonfire. Flame consumed it all, and the people cheered seeing the national heroes and religious martyrs burn, ashes streaming towards the stars - Friends of the dead! From the masses, a man of spiritual youth climbed atop stacked crates and luggage in front of the fire - Comrade Semenko, who had arrived in uniform to see the greatest flame of the young generation of faithful communists.\n\n"My friends! We stand before not just a flame, but a symbol of our joint struggle for a better tomorrow! I won't speak for long, as young proletarians don't have time for nonsensical babble. What I can say is that you should use your time to the fullest, for work, for entertainment, for creativity! Not for kneeling before the altar or for money. It's all worthless! Kobzars are dead men who don't care about us, the living. Why should we praise them? What I propose to you is a radical resolution to this problem! I call to burn it all! Burn the past! Death to what is old! Long live the future and the future alone!"\n\nThe crowd raised their fists in the air and roared in approval. With that, Semenko came down and joined them in throwing the relics into the great hearth, tearing books and trampling on icons. When the pile of rubbish had cleared, Ukraine's youth began a joyous dance around the rising fire - a fire set in the whole of the country that would never go out."

With independence, the desire to finish such a significant project has remained, yet work was slow and as of yet produced only one turbine, which provides electricity only to part of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nIn recent years the futurists and technocrats in the Rada became seriously interested not only in the completion of the project, but also in its significant expansion of the power plant from the planned five to eight turbines! It was decided under the new government to allocate a significant amount of finance to that end, to involve the most competent workers who could be found across the country and hire a coterie of foreign specialists. Budgeting quickly revealed the scale of the task, which on completion will be the largest hydroelectric power station in the world, intended as a symbol of productive power and the will of the new, proletarian Ukraine.\n\nWork is already in full swing: tireless black arrows of locomotive trains transport materials on different sides of the river, hundreds of workers are busy day and night - some teams form concrete barriers, others dig pits that will serve as a working area, others have begun construction of temporary water utilities and pumps. Somewhere in the distance they are already preparing a place for the installation and commissioning of the second turbine, where future shock workers battalions and heroes and labor are having temporary housing and amenities constructed for the long road ahead. Cranes swing on their towers in the scorching heat, dragging materials and laborers from shift to shift, and factories across the country smelt the pieces of the mechanical hearts which, thanks to human genius, will turn water into light and animate the machinery of the new world."

And what is the best manifestation of this god, of this unstoppable holy force, if not art, the most expressive creation of the human hand? This is a god fit for a new world.\n\nThe temple of old God Yahwe in Vinnytsia was reforged by the human hand to be a lair of art, and today all of the townspeople gathered for a new ritual. Women, men, and children alike came in groups to experience beauty. Icons of Yahwe remained in his old temple but how insignificant did they appear against the children of art? Saints of Yahwe stared fearfully at geometrif paintings of circles, squares, and other assemblages calculated in the human mind and given form by the human spirit. What was the violent sacrifice of the Lamb of God compared to the brute form in moving shapes that became cars and planes put on canvas? What was an icon of a dead man compared to the art of a true resurrection in the stars, or a grandiose video from a military range showing a test of rockets that climbed to the starry sky? How does a dead god give anything beautiful to man? The new templegoers were being impressed on the ability to make meaning in a void of stars which had until now been outside of their concern.\n\nOne old woman appeared less reverent, more sad... maybe even angry. When she came to the depiction of a monstrous pig-capitalist on the cross, with the worker's spear leaving a red star on his side, perhaps the caption reading "we died for their sins" was too much. In a furious act, she threw the iconoclastic painting on the floor and leapt upon it, her body animated with a passion to destroy it. A security guard had almost reached her when a young man in a smock stopped them both with a shout.\n\n"Stop it! Don't arrest her! She did nothing wrong! She did what we were doing to her sacrum. She destroyed our idols as we were destroying hers!"\n\nThis man was the author of this piece of art, and he did not appear as distraught as expected. No, he was smiling and laughing seeing that all. He turned around to the surprised crowd and continued.\n\n"Truly I tell you, this poor widow has become a greater futurist than you all there gathered. You all gave your attention and a short moment of life to the art, but she, out of her rage, put in everything she felt — all the passion and vitality she had to just destroy this one painting!"\n\nWhether out of confusion, embarrassment, or consideration of the role she now played in the futurist model, the old woman fled from the temple. At the request of the artist, she was not arrested, but perhaps she faced a worse fate: to eventually be forgotten with the old world she knew."

Unlikely, given the circumstances of his arrest. What did he do? He knew that his uncle Symon Petliura wasn't the most honest man but what did HE do? Practicing his faith and preaching the good gospel? He was praying intently when another prisoner was brought to the cell, one he found surprisingly familiar. It was Lazar Kaganovych, one of the loudest opponents of Semenko. Skrypnyk was surprised to see this old bastard rotting in a cell with him, and evidently it was obvious enough that the communist chuckled and answered the unspoken thoughts.\n\n"Yeah, I know it's hard to believe that I'm rotting here."\n\nKaganovych sat next to Skrypnyk and saw a rosary in his hand. He pointed his finger at the bauble and continued.\n\n"You believe He will save you? What will save you in here is probably work detail, unless you have the same sentence I do! Ha! What were you doing boy? You know, before the prison?"\n\nSkrypnyk frowned a bit, then replied to Kaganovych, skeptical of his intentions.\n\n"What? I was a priest. But why do you want to talk to me? Don't you have better things to do?"\n\n"Oh don't be so grumpy, son! I would probably order to shoot you if I ruled but..."\n\n"... but you aren't ruling."\n\n"Yes! That's it! Nobody in the seminary brainwashed you completely, and you still can see clearly. But tell me, do you have any family? Father, mother? You know that in the moment before my trial, I'm escaping with my thoughts to my wonderful wife?"\n\n"My mother and father are rather safe...

What is your name, shaveling?"\n\n"Stepan Skrypnyk"\n\n"Nice to meet you."\n\nKaganovych offered a hand. Skrypnyk refused to shake it, yet the prisoner's rough nature didn't seem to be hiding ill intent, and soon...\n\nThe conversation between them lasted a few days, covering everyday matters and ones of political philosophy. Despite their many differences, something approximating a friendship developed between two men, united as they were under one roof.\n\nYet despite Kaganovych's assurances that when he got out of prison, he would find Skrypnyk to take him for a beer or even to a brothel, it couldn't last. Kaganovych was sentenced to death shortly after his imprisonment, and Skrypnyk to hard labor. Still, the priest kept his mind busy, and one of his projects was documenting the old comrade's final conversations in hopes of passing them on to his wife."

A desire not to become ignorant or naive, but wiser and happier together with brothers and sisters in socialist comradery. Many of you call me a cutthroat for that simple wish, as I didn't make any secret of what we had to do to the Mikhnovites, Banderites, UNDO, the Knights, and the other reactionaries who openly fantasize about throwing us in the Dnieper. Yet look - we simply arrested them for threatening their fellow man." He said the last line cheerily, to some cheers and laughs, before moving on.\n\n"Some of you call me a revisionist, a Leninist, maybe a Bogdanovite or other labels I don't care for. If the interest of the Ukrainian state aligns with the interest of the world revolution, I am for it. For now that means exporting Ukrainian grain and meat to comrades, and importing from them fuel, intellectuals, coal... and most importantly a good drink!"\n\nHe snapped his fingers and bottles of wine entered the Rada and were redistributed. Barrels rolled out of parliament and timidly, citizens began to help themselves with an alcoholic drink. Lazar Kaganovych himself reached for a glass of wine and lifted it and continued his speech, laughing.\n\n"Now, I can't wait for you to call me a drunk communist, a wine communist, or a champagne communist. I don't care! To hell with it, I'm a wine communist if it makes you happy. But I will tell you who I think I am, or at least what I want to be in the eyes of the proletariat. I am Gracchus - the People's Tribune! I cut the price of grain in half to make more bread. I contacted the Poles to start a real railway line from Warsaw to Kyiv. I sweet-talked the Germans about fuelling our new power plants supplying electricity to every household! I met with our comrades in Kavkaz to build a common front against Muscovite imperialism! And I managed to turn this broken machine called Ukraine into a self-sufficient organism."\n\n"Am I a Leninist? Am I still a Bolshevik? Yes, I am! I call for a grander revolution, and a greater Ukrainian state that can break down the walls of division and make the common man happier and wiser too.
