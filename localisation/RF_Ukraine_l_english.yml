#Brief history
UKR_DESC_MENU:0 "인테르마리움에서 가장 위대한 등대들 중 하나이자 또한 그의 곡창지대인 자유로운 우크라이나는 발전 중인 민주국가로서 세계에서 이름이 난 나라로, 강력한 복지와 전반적으로 성장 중인 경제를 갖고 있습니다. 하지만 의회에서 벌어지는 부패를 경멸하는 많은 이들 가운데엔, 전국에 깔린 독일 협력파와, 우크라이나의 자유를 지키기 위해 군사위원회가 필요하다 말하는 이들도 있습니다. 그러나 또 다른 집단이 우크라이나 전역에서 나타나고 있으니, 바로 촉진주의 연정입니다. 국가의 미래를 위한 이 대난투에서 과연 누가 이기게 될까요?"

#Leader descriptions
UKR_Symon_Petliura_DESC:0 "As his second term comes to an end, Symon Petliura is aiming to be Ukraine's first, second, and third president. While three terms isn't exactly unheard of for a president, some opponents are shouting with foam at the mouth about how him and his political allies are corrupted. Despite this, Petliura is optimistic about his chances of leading Ukraine into a strong and free future."
UKR_Mykhailo_Hrushevskyi_desc:0 "To some, Mykhailo Hrushevsky is the father of Ukrainian Independence, the man who led Ukraine to where it is today. To others, he is a radical socialist, a saboteur who wishes to nosedive Ukraine into ruin and tyranny. Regardless of who is correct, Hrushevsky is now a president of Ukraine. He shall lead the republic to democratic socialism over the next seven years."
UKR_Dmytro_Doroshenko_desc:0 "By all accounts, Dmytro Doroshenko should be the perfect liberal candidate, and to foreigners in America who have dubbed him the "Ukrainian Washington", he is. But for Ukrainians who are familiar with his background of support for federal ties with Russia, his past is a bit suspect. Nonetheless, Doroshenko hopes to win over hearts and minds with his humanistic policies and focus on human rights."
UKR_Vyacheslav_Lypynsky_desc:0 "Vyacheslav Lypynsky is the founder of the Ukrainian Democratic-Peasant Party, as well as the Ukrainian ambassador to Austria. Lypynsky is heavily inspired by the reformism of Pyotr Stolypin, but uses Stolypinism to further Ukrainian interests and enhance Ukrainian conservatism. If nothing else, Lypynsky aims to build a stable capitalist republic in Ukraine."
UKR_Pavlo_Skoropadskyi_desc:0 "파울로 스코로파드스키는 다채로운 이력의 소유자입니다. 귀족, 국가지도자, 군사장교, 그리고 이젠 우크라이나의 헤트만까지. His personalist dictatorship shall now protect Ukraine from all manner of threats, both internal and external. For contrary to popular belief, the battle against Bolshevism in Ukraine has only just begun. Today, these devils label themselves as \"accelerationists\" and \"republicans\", but Skoropadsky knows them all too well, and he plans on ridding Ukraine off them for good."
UKR_Petro_Bolbochan_desc:0 "한때 우크라이나 육군의 일개 대령에 불과했던 페트로 볼보찬은 has now been awarded the title of Supreme Commander of All Ukraine by the Accelerationist militias who brought him to power. Bolbochan is, perhaps, the most powerful man in the world who wishes not to rule, an unwilling autocrat. Of course, this means he will inevitably be replaced but the grandeur and importance of his position isn't lost on him, nor the enemies of the new Ukraine."
UKR_Yevhen_Petrushevych_desc:0 "International marketeers have been eyeing Ukraine's ample natural resources for decades and now president Petrushevych has opened Ukraine for business. Democracy will come in time, sure, but first Petrushevych's administration wants to optimize our marketa to be as efficient as possible."
UKR_olena_teliha_desc:0 "올레나 텔리하는 과거 리위우에 거점을 둔 종족미래주의 집단인 갈리치야회의 수장입니다. As the newly elected president of Ukraine, she hopes to bring the aristocratic ideals of her Society to a new, prometheistic Ukraine. Among accelerationists, Teliha is most aptly labelled as an elitist, believing in a "Cultural Revolution From the Top Down", much to the consternation of the Ukrainian Popular Worker's Party."
UKR_stepan_bandera_desc:0 "스테판 반데라가 청년이 불과하다곤 해도, 부족한 그의 연륜은 열정으로 채워졌습니다. 첫 족진주의 선거에서 자유 카자크 평의회와 우크라이나 민족재건반을 승리로 이끈 반데라는 이제 우크라이나를 향한 자신의 전망을 이룩하고자 합니다. 혁명 민족주의적인 생디칼리스트 국가 말입니다."
UKR_Ivan_Pavlenko_desc:0 "While Ivan's political views may be described as reactionary at best, insane at worst, it is undeniable that he has much influence in the Ukrainian government. Thus, he was allowed to essentially declare himself dictator until a proper monarch can be appointed. As Ivan prepares to take the crown, he thanks almighty God that his brother had not been elected, or else Ukraine might be a half-assed republican mess."
UKR_Mykhailo_Omelyanovych_Pavlenko_desc:0 "Mykhailo has always believed in a healthy republic, even if the term "republic" was being used fairly loosely. After all, in his mind, a democracy which made itself vulnerable to communist or accelerationist takeover was not a democracy worth to defend. The Ukrainian people now have total freedom, including freedom from voting for the wrong party. Every day, Mykhailo thanks God that his brother wasn't elected, or else Ukraine might be some kind of backwards dictatorship once more."
UKR_Vasyl_Vyshyvanyi_desc:0 "오스트리아 혈통을 가졌음에도, 국왕 와실은 blends with any of the most patriotic Ukrainians, in typical Habsburg fashion. Although Vasyl has been mostly writing poetry in recent years, the throne is where any Habsburg belongs, and he has taken to his position quite quickly. As an added bonus, Vasyl's Austrian heritage may offer him favor in dealings with European leaders."
UKR_emperor_ivan_desc:0 "누가 우크라이나의 왕좌에 앉아야 하느냐는 물음에, 대통령 이완 오멜랴노위치-파울렌코는 자신보다 더 적합한 이를 떠올려 내지 못했습니다. 새 왕조를 개창한 이완은 이제 새 우크라이나 제국을 세우고자 합니다. 우선 해야 할 일은요? 모스크바 놈들의 위협을 일소하는 것입니다."
UKR_mykhail_semenko_desc:0 "시적인 연설로 우크라이나 대중을 사로잡은 미하일로 세멘코는 이제 범민족주의와 좌익 촉진주의를 통해 우크라이나를 바꿔 놓으려 합니다. In comparison to other accelerationists, Semenko and his New Art Wing are much closer to the working class, causing some to analyze his ideology as a synthesis of Marxism and Futurism. That being said, the party official rejects Communism in favor of state socialism and futurism."
UKR_mykhailo_volobuyev_desc:0 "미하일로 월로부예우는 has gone far from home in order to import a new concept to Ukraine: the Technate. Inspired by American Technocrats, Volobuyev's model for a self-sufficient Ukraine is very popular with our nation's engineers and scientists. This platform has also managed to please members of every class, leading to a class collaborationist government. Volobuyev has the potential to truly bring Ukraine into the future."

However, Skoropadsky decided to play Cincinnatus, as he announced his intent to resign, with new democratic elections being held on the future composition of the Parliament, next President of the Republic being decided (as always) by coalition agreement. It must be said that while overall the international community has received our return to democracy positively, both Reds and May-Mayevsky’s cronies expressed dissatisfaction. The former - because they were eager to portray Skoropadsky as a bloodthirsty autocrat. The later - because “Kievan Junta” has become a running gag in newspaper headlines about Ukraine in Kharkiv and Moscow alike, even if their own government is arguably much less democratic, which once more shows our enemies’ hypocrisy."

ukraine.1.desc:0 "When it seemed that the day in the parliament won't get any worse, it was spotted that an MP from a fairly minor centre-right party was going to the podium. It took several seconds for the audience to process that this MP was Mykola Mikhnovsky himself. Some yawned, others prepared to listen, knowing that what will follow won't be constituted of anything except bullshit. Or so it usually appeared. Mikhnovsky took the position at the podium, overseeing the halls of Central Rada. So majestic, even if rather small, this house provided such a picture of democracy's infallibility...such an illusion of it.\n-Dear citizens of Ukraine, dear men and women, dear cossacks, and undear scum that are elected to this very council by the people you fool! - Mikhnovsky began his speech, took a cup of water, and continued:\n-When I look at these halls, I always adore - well, “adore” - how utterly pompous and majestic our parliamentarians always behave, and how truly unyielding our democracy looks...at a first glance. In truth, however, - you all know! - that this is a lie. And yes, journalists, write it down, the masses need to know the truth. It is a lie - that nothing threatens our democracy! I can say for sure - three quarters of present here deputies are corrupted, at least a third of those corrupted are involved in voting fraud, - for there's no other reason for those three people over there in UPSR sector to be re-elected, everyone knows the peasants' opinion on that party in the region! And what, you might ask, is everything I told, for that is all old news - both to you and to the public. But let me say it... I don't care if it's going to kill me... What I definitely know, is that half of the parliament is working for Germans! YES! Half of you bastards are working as shills for disgusting krauts in Berlin, you have sold your Fatherland for a piece of bratwurst, just because your VKSSS puppet masters tell ya! I don't care whether you laugh at me right now, for I know that what you truly abhor - for you fear the truth, the truth just right now revealed!\nWhen deputy Mykola Mikhnovsky later got into a much more rambling, and progressively more and more incomprehensible ranting, group of MPs urged him to get down and back to his seat, which Mykola reluctantly agreed after two notebooks and a tomato thrown at him. When normal proceedings resumed, some deputies did look quizzically at Mikhnovsky, but that wasn't something odd - dude had already established his reputation as a jingoistic clown. Anyway, newspapers were expected to publish this story, and some MPs did get uneasy during the speech, one of them saying that perhaps a snap election year ahead the schedule would increase the people's confidence in democracy. As the break between meetings was announced, MPs and journalists alike went to the parliamentary cafeteria. Of them, two people separated from the main group. One said to other…"

Weird, this situation was. Private plane from Kaunas, with two engines and enough space to fit in thirty passengers, although only ten were on board. “Four Baltic Germans from Riga, three Lithuanians, two Prussians and a Dutchman? All boarding a private plane belonging to a Prussian nobleman, with this as cargo?!” - said Kost’ in French to one of passengers, who appeared to be some sort of informal leader to three or four other passengers...with disturbingly un-civilian manners. Meanwhile, Tymish went to another group of border guards, who were inspecting the cargo. He walked to one of the boxes which the plane was transporting - nothing suspicious, at a first glance. Having nothing to do, as no passenger was really that suspicious, Tymish kicked the box slightly with his boot. A metal cling. \nAlerted by this, the officer took out a knife and cracked the box open. What was inside shouldn’t have been on a cargo of a normal civilian plane. \nNoticing this, one of the passengers softly walked up to Tymish’s back and touched the border guard...with a concealed revolver.

Said conference was actually less of an artistic event and more of a political rally, since besides the many futurists and modernists, including rather famous and talented artists, here were present leaders of various paramilitaries, as well as the paramilitaries themselves. In fact, granted how the event was held right on Dumska square, and that most of the present here carried weapons with them, some not even hiding it, the only thing worth waiting for was Bolbochan’s letter.\nAnd here it was. Oh, how wonderful this news was to Accelerationist leaders right now! \nIn a matter of minutes, improvised festival-slash-meeting was reorganized into battle columns. Young people from all un-occupied regions of Ukraine, - and rather old people as well, here and there, - some carrying flags, some with slogan-adorned banners, some with rifles, pistols or even swords, both in military uniforms and civilian clothes, traditional rural and fashionable urban - all sorts of people were here, supporters of change, supporters of something that among the establishment only Bolbochan and like-minded people didn’t found offensive.\n“First Squad, MARCH!”\nThe march began. And in less than an hour, when the vanguard of demonstrants has reached Central Rada, shouting anti-Petliura slogans, the march turned into an improvised siege. \nWhen the guardsman tried to block the way, he was threatened with bayonets and almost ran over by the crowd, but somehow he survived, and a few minutes later joined the protestors himself. Doors of the Parliament were rattled with bullets until a girl from the crowd threw a hand grenade at them, cracking them open.

Seldom not criticized, but still somewhat respectable president of Ukraine announced that elections will be held one year ahead of the schedule, with any parties which want to participate invited to.

A man in the USDRP section apparently knew already what was going to happen, as did a deputy or two in UPSR sector.\nSkoropadsky looked at the crowd with his piercing stare, and spoke - his words being carried around the country by radio and written down by the journalists:“I hereby proclaim the military’s authority over entire Ukraine, temporarily pausing the article of Constitution concerning the presidency, and dissolve the parliament in the name of Ukraine immediately, question of next elections being postponed until the salvation is brought to our Fatherland.”"

Daughter didn’t want to go, and the son said that he would fight to the bitter end, but father persuaded the kids to run. And only then, having his rifle grabbed, he walked to the front door. \nWhen two children were already a mile away from their village, they saw light. And no, it wasn’t just their house that was burning. Unable to satisfy their desire of carnage by slaughtering just one dissident, Drozdovites burned down the entire village. Those criminals, those marauders have shot on sight anyone trying to escape. The two kids who got over the border, the book still relatively intact, were the only villagers who have survived to tell this story.’ \nSo this is what our compatriots are fleeing. So this is kind of atrocities committed by the very people I once fought alongside against the Germans. - mused a middle-aged man in a comfy apartment in Kyiv, upon reading a newspaper article - one of the few, detailing the utter horror of how East Ukraine suffered under the occupiers’ boot."

New envelope, rolled into a cylinder - invitation to lunch. \nWhile in the elevator, Sofia thought about what was happening to her and around her in the past few months. Firstly, her brother, who had tuberculosis, got a rather cheap ticket by the so-called “Teliha programme” to Italy, where he was being healed while having his expenses covered by state medical budget, expanded by Mala Rada’s decree some three months ago. It was rather wonderful that airplanes now were both faster and cheaper, and (judging by her brother’s telegrams) pretty comfortable too - and it was a Ukrainian airlines’ plane, not French or British. Then, the overall goods’ quality was improved, Sofia had a pay high enough to buy a car - and yes, she no longer worked for that asshole landlord as his kids’ tutor, for she got a prestigious job at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - where she was right now, enjoying a top quality lunch in a room done according to art deco style. And yes, while her own perspectives were wonderful, the ones of the state were even better. In the newsreel she had a glimpse of before going to lunch, Sofia saw that the great president Olena Teliha had intention of reclaiming Ukrainian territories beyond the Dnipro river, intention of entering the grand alliance of forces of progress - which was implied to be Fiume and France. Sofia’s grandma may disagree, but it was obvious to everyone else - whatever should be done to expand Ukraine’s glory is justified, because in the end, every Ukrainian will enjoy progress just as much as Sofia and her colleagues."

This time, Bender’s goal was the tracking down of an elusive \"underground millionaire\" Koreiko. From there on, the story unfolds on a truly epic scale, with Ostap’s adventures across the Black Sea coast and Steppes leading him to a certainly unusual finale, which the authors asked not to reveal prematurely in any newspaper reviews. As usual, readers should expect a lot of Odessite humour, lots of interesting characters and funny situations, and an answer to a question which was already stated by many fans of the writer duo - what are Ostap Bender’s real motives, and would there ever be a part three of this epic story?"
