#FOCUSES
MNS_ronin_of_manshu:0 "The Ronin of Manshu"     #NOTE TO TRANSLATORS - YOU DO NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT TRANSLATING THE HAIKUS
MNS_ronin_of_manshu_desc:0 "Cold mist cleared by moon\nWarriors wake, cursing fate.\nCherry trees blossom.\n\nZhang Zongyuan once had another name, in another land. Junnosuke Date, descendant of the illustrious and ancient Date clan. Of course the Samurai fell over half a century ago, having been stripped of their ancient rights and swords. Now he is without a master, but not without a cause. As Manchuria descends into a nightmare of lunatics taking over the asylum, the people cry out for deliverance. The ronin may yet save them, and perhaps China too."
MNS_blacked_dragons:0 "Black Dragons Swimming"
MNS_blacked_dragons_desc:0 "Winter waters flow\nThe current black, river old.\nDragons swim upstream.\n\nThe Japanese have had secret societies for some years now, one of the more prominent and influential of these being the Black Dragon society. They have already been active for decades, with the members doing everything in their power to reduce and (if possible) to expel Russian influence from the Pacific. With the collapse of Manchuria, their ultimate goal may be within arms reach, and they are willing to support us if it means the destruction of Russian influence."
MNS_red_beards:0 "Red Beards Marching"
MNS_red_beards_desc:0 "The forest silent.\nA bear growling by water.\nSilenced by gunfire.\n\nThe Redbeards once referred to the hardy Russian pioneers that arrived on the banks of the Amur centuries ago, pillaging Manchuria. The term now applies to the bandits that swarm this land, who despite their reputation for robbery and violence all have one other thing in common - their shared hatred of the Russians. All such bandits will rally to our banner if it means the expulsion of their hated enemy."
MNS_se_no:0 "Se, No!"
MNS_se_no_desc:0 "The black dragon swims\nDown his river, turbulent.\nA fork now, which way?\n\nThe chaos of the collapse of Zheltorossiya will one day give way to order. Having established our own powerbase there still remains a rather important question to ponder. Should we reach out to our friends in Honshu and collaborate in building a future together, or is there something to be gained in ridding ourselves of those who would be our masters?"
MNS_asian_future:0 "Our Asian Future"
MNS_asian_future_desc:0 "Do not look behind:\nLike Winter dusk, the past fades.\nNow bayonets gleam.\n\nNo other continent is as large nor as full of people as Asia is. But it was broken up between Russia, Britain, and other powers beside. We alone have the power to break those who, even now, rape and pillage China, Siberia, India, and many more beside. The humiliation of the past will be shorn away, and the light of a glorious future will illuminate the path forwards."
MNS_yihequan_past:0 "Our Yihequan Past"
MNS_yihequan_past_desc:0 "Damp riverbank sands\nHave boot prints overlapping,\nThe river runs red.\n\nAs a true vanguard of Chinese self-determination, the Yihequan left behind a legacy yet unrivaled. The patriots that joined them brought terror to the foreign invaders. It took not one, nor two, but eight of the supposed \"Great Powers\" to silence them. Let's once more raise our fists and deal a knockout blow to the West!"
MNS_threekingdoms:0 "Three Kingdoms Without Romance"
MNS_threekingdoms_desc:0 "All beneath heaven\nSay bye to the setting sun,\nAnd embrace moonlight.\n\nThe lunacy of this era knows no bounds. People flee their homes, industries suffer, the fields go fallow, and tough decisions must be made. We cannot give people the benefit of the doubt, nor can idealism stir our hearts. Suspected spies must be shot regardless. Towns with defenseless civilians may need to be abandoned. Requisitions of food and supplies must be carried out if our soldiers are to keep marching."
MNS_take_their_guns:0 "Take Their Guns"
MNS_take_their_guns_desc:0 "Lightning flickering,\nNight skies are burning and bright.\nStill eyes gaze at clouds.\n\nThroughout Manchuria there lay stockpiles of guns and munitions hidden away, either by the hands of our enemies or neutral parties. Anything from bribery to brute force can be used to convince their caretakers to part with these supplies. Harbin itself has arsenals and barracks full to bursting which corrupt Russian officers are only too happy to sell to us in return for some drugs or riches stolen from one of his comrades."
MNS_cut_their_lines:0 "Cut Their Lines"
MNS_cut_their_lines_desc:0 "Rain pelting dry wood,\nPreceding lightning, thunder.\nThe bridge, atomized.\n\nThe Honghuzi are experts in guerilla warfare, and know the land like the back of their hand. They can travel deep behind enemy lines to sow discord, sniping their officers, destroying bridges and telegraph poles, misdirecting trains full of supplies, or even blowing up their storehouses. Handpicking the best of them to lead highly motivated, trained, and equipped teams to carry out strikes against strategic locations will reward our effort ten times over."
MNS_burn_crops:0 "Burn the Peasants' Crops"
MNS_burn_crops_desc:0 "His life's work, now ashes.\nSo they may spite his master.\nHis belly grumbles.\n\nThere are socialists besides the factory workers and machinists in Harbin, and many of them happen to be farmers who were swayed by Boldyrev and his agrarian socialism. Factory or field, it matters little. The wily general represents the greatest threat to us, for he not only possesses some legitimacy among the people but also a grudge against Zhang Zongyuan. Raiding the farms and villages that supply his armies will be necessary to weaken him before we deliver the killing blow."
MNS_shatter_tools:0 "Shatter the Workers' Tools"
MNS_shatter_tools_desc:0 "Red flags billowing,\nWith golden warmth embroidered.\nBeneath, cold winter.\n\nThe workers in Harbin may have fooled themselves into believing that they have won liberty and equality, but the rest of Manchuria does not. Socialists of every stripe and color pepper the land like inflamed red boils. They represent an insidious infection of the land and people, and so must be carefully lanced and surgically removed. Failure to do so risks it getting worse."
MNS_cashier_swords:0 "Cashier the Colonists' Swords"
MNS_cashier_swords_desc:0 "My lord, the shepherd.\nHis iron crook freed my soul\nFrom the yoke of flesh.\n\nSome from elsewhere pry where they should not. Konstantin Rodzaevsky raised an army of clerics, fanatics, and lunatics to preach the godly word of slaughter and destruction of the jews and freemasons. They see jews in the shadows, hence their reason for coming here from Yakutia. Although poorly equipped, their danger lies in their heatless cruelty and desire to barbarically slaughter anyone who isn't one of them."
MNS_drive_bastards:0 "Drive out Stolypin's Bastards"
MNS_drive_bastards_desc:0 "The falcon once soared.\nHis little bell rang, and then\nHe fell to green earth.\n\nThe Europeans are not wholly indivisible, and besides Russians there have come other races to Manchuria. Ukrainians have settled throughout the land in some numbers and in the wake of the collapse have decided to establish their own Ukraine in the east. It matters not who they are and their reasons for being there. They refuse and subvert our rule, wishing to run their own affairs. And so they must be made to leave."
MNS_castrate_robbers:0 "Castrate Stolypin's Robbers"
MNS_castrate_robbers_desc:0 "Gold chills the rich heart\nHis summer sun, winter ice\nIn workers dead souls.\n\nPriamurye is the gathering up of the rich capitalists and their henchmen. Fearing the loss of their assets and secondly of their lives, the oligarchs decided to establish their own government backed by mercenaries and the power of money. Always the same, unable to keep their hands out of the cash drawer, they're stealing Manchuria blind - and yet they get to be a legitimate government - what a sick joke. Given their cowardly nature we need only march in before the rats jump ship."
MNS_back_across_amur:0 "Back Across the Amur"
MNS_back_across_amur_desc:0 "The bear limps, bleeding.\nDyeing the river crimson.\nWinter snows soon fall.\n\nWith our armies now establishing control over what was once Zheltorossiya, there is nobody left to fight for the colonizers now left here. With their estates being confiscated or with eviction on the horizon, most Russians have decided to leave of their own accord. Packing up everything they can carry, streams of refugees and war criminals trickle along roads or cling to the sides of trains as they go back to Russia. Soon only memories will remain."
MNS_raising_banners:0 "Raising our Banners"
MNS_raising_banners_desc:0 "Pennants fluttering:\nOur drums echo, soldiers roar.\nSpring fields lie empty.\n\nIn times of great conflict, the great lords draw upon the country to furnish their armies. Peasants, landlords, craftsmen and the like. Remnants of the old Eight Banners system outlived the Qing Empire, still-living members of which can join our army. But even here, the modern world penetrates and we must adapt. For now, it can serve as the basis of our conscription service, ensuring that we will have the requisite manpower for the struggles to come. "
MNS_mongol_brothers:0 "Our Mongol Brothers"
MNS_mongol_brothers_desc:0 "Neath the boundless sky,\nTen thousand hooves thunder.\nRampaging, yet tamed.\n\nThe Mongols once ruled Asia, and it is only through them that we will unite Asia once more. Skilled on horseback and with a carbine, many are veterans of the civil wars in China and Russia, and will take little convincing to mount the saddle once more. If we make efforts to secure their loyalty, they will remain devoted."
MNS_noble_manchu:0 "The Noble Manchus"
MNS_noble_manchu_desc:0 "An old tiger sleeps:\nSnow settles on his gray mane.\nSpringtime approaches.\n\nThe Manchu have declined over the years from their height of power and influence under the Qing, but some still remain within Greater Manchuria. They once conquered and ruled over all of China, so it would be wise to incorporate their numbers into our armies and administration. Who knows, perhaps they may yet see China united once more."
MNS_hotline_fuji:0 "Hotline Fuji"
MNS_hotline_fuji_desc:0 "A mountain, silent.\nSnowmelt trickling down her rocks,\nBecoming torrents.\n\nThe Black Dragon Society in Japan was founded by former samurai who saw there being only one way to move forwards. That way was to oppose Russia no matter the cost, and they have the ears of the politicians and the souls of the people. Tōyama Mitsuru will be more than willing to find ways to move men, money, and munitions into our hands."
MNS_sidelining_warlords:0 "Sidelining the Warlords"
MNS_sidelining_warlords_desc:0 "All men have a price,\nAnd many bury it deep.\nA seedling smothered.\n\nThe warlords of China range from military governors to monarchical despots. More than a few of them are smart and talented, but also pose a danger in their own right. Thankfully they are as human as anyone else, and can be either bribed, blackmailed, or bullied into obedience. By this we can strategically reduce the number of powerful men that may yet adhere to an agenda that we find unfavorable."
MNS_chivalric_cavalry:0 "The Chivalric Cavalry"
MNS_chivalric_cavalry_desc:0 "Proud horse, head tossing,\nHonor rides his back, whooping.\nHis Colt, held firmly.\n\nThe days of knights, and samurai have long since passed into the history books. In the modern era we can speak only of heavy artillery, rifles, and many more terrible instruments of war beside. But the grandsons of the last of these warriors still stand in our ranks, having come here from the chivalrous Black Dragon Society and Yakuza syndicates with hot young blood eager to prove their worth."
MNS_five_races:0 "Five Races Under One Flag"
MNS_five_races_desc:0 "A rainbow appears:\nRaging storms settle down.\nColors in harmony.\n\nIn China there live five major ethnicities, each corresponding to a color. While this color scheme traditionally represented the elements long ago, there remains a kernel of wisdom in this attitude; that in order to be master over all Asia, one must first be master over each element constituting China."
MNS_rattling_sabers:0 "Rattling Our Sabers"
MNS_rattling_sabers_desc:0 "Carts rumble and roll,\nSwords sheathed by green soldiers' waists.\nAlready their girls yearn.\n\nThe time has now come for us to move, and it is now or never against the mad Muscovites who even now intrude upon our lands. Let us make a show of force, a warning of what is to come for them and their lackeys! It is time to charge forth, and chase them all out. Let them hear the clash of sabres and the rumble of hooves. Ready now! Charge, charge forth!"
MNS_our_fair_due:0 "Our Fair Due"
MNS_our_fair_due_desc:0 "A field cold, dead.\nA bear without food must leave.\nPlum blossoms flower.\n\nWhen the Russian Empire expanded into this part of the world, they brought farmers, merchants, soldiers, and prisoners with them. Settling down, they cut down our trees, took our fish, and dug our minerals. Who gave these people permission? Not us, not us. What they took must be repaid in full, in interest, with our thumbs on the scales. Everything."
MNS_land_they_stole:0 "The Land They Stole"
MNS_land_they_stole_desc:0 "Capital measures\nSummer days and winter nights.\nTomorrow, our air.\n\nThe basis of wealth has been established since time immemorial, and that is the ownership of property. But who owns it all? The Russians, Europeans, devils and other scoundrels who see fit only do one thing, and that is to extract as much of it as humanly possible from our people. What gives them the right to do this? Why should this land belong to them, when they are the invaders? Requisitioning their estates is necessary to ensure social justice."
MNS_rape_of_harbin:0 "The Rape of Harbin"
MNS_rape_of_harbin_desc:0 "Winds howl past walls, through\nMarching cadets, who sing too.\nThe river listens.\n\nWhy are the bastards that colonized our land still here? Those criminals who masquerade as harmless and innocent civilians? They took this land by fire, by force, by sword. Why shouldn't we also? When we burn their houses, seize their riches, and feed them to the wolves, we will remind them of the smoking cinders that were once homes, and of the beats growing fat on the flesh of Manchurians. For the Russians, there will be no mercy."
MNS_warring_states:0 "The Warring States"
MNS_warring_states_desc:0 "An old palace groans,\nHer walls are assailed by storm.\nDry rot, more fatal.\n\nThis has not been the first time in history that a country has collapsed into a civil war with radically opposed factions, nor will it be the last. This cycle has touched China, Japan, and Russia before, all bound by the inevitability that all that begins must end, and all endings signify a new beginning."
MNS_defend_our_home:0 "To Defend Our Home"
MNS_defend_our_home_desc:0 "A cold house, haunted.\nI'll pay all to banish them,\nTo make it a home.\n\nThe Honghuzi were always on their own side, as is the nature of the bandit. But even they have their preferences, and it is preferable that they go after the Russians and anyone aligned with them rather than their fellow countryman. Bringing them in line and framing banditry as a patriotic act against foreign invaders would do much to build legitimacy among (Chinese) people tired of being robbed."
MNS_render_unto_huangdi:0 "Render unto Huangdi"
MNS_render_unto_huangdi_desc:0 "Autumn soon fading,\nThe sovereign counts, gathers.\nFor now, sufficient.\n\nAs much as it pains us to admit, our rule is anything but secure or legitimized. Farmers and tradesmen alike hide their wealth when our men come knocking, and seek protection against banditry. It does no good to allow this state of affairs to continue. Reeling in the bandits, establishing official tax collectors, and making an effort to uphold law and order. These are the basics of governance, without which it will be impossible to rule, let alone build our army."
MNS_victory_over_maozi:0 "Victory over the Maozi"
MNS_victory_over_maozi_desc:0 "Snow descends, softly\nSmothering all, silencing.\nWe may sleep easy.\n\nThe Russians are finally no more. Whatever soldiers answered their call to arms or politicians convinced the people, all that is now irrelevant. They're gone now. While some individuals or military units remain, they are little more than bandits soon to be cleaned up. Order has been restored, the people no longer live in constant fear of rampaging armies, and our rule is now absolute."
MNS_heilong_clique:0 "Proclaim the Heilong Clique"
MNS_heilong_clique_desc:0 "I sit, Black Dragon.\nBeneath a cherry blossom.\nBranches bare, autumn\nHiganbana alone blooms.\nI do not cry, but plan more.\n\nWhat was once an extremity of Moscovy is now an independent power in its own right. Chaos has given way to order, and our ramshackle collection of bandits has grown into a professional army. Our administration collects taxes, and our cities produce manufactured goods in factories. We are an independent power, and should establish foreign relations to make this fact known. We are the Heilong clique! All of China shall tremble at our name!"

MNS.1.t:0 "A Parlay in Hulunbuir"
MNS.1.desc:0 "Two longtime friends and survivors held court, the Russian Republic burning behind them.\n\nFor Date Junnosuke, or Zhang Zongyuan to his compatriot, the past few weeks had meant success beyond his wildest dreams. State control had always been thin on the ground at the juncture between Mongolia and Manchuria - Japan growing more concerned with matters to the south and in the Home Islands meant no more oversight. And then the Russians…! Striking a thousand little blows for Pan-Asianism on the frontier was one thing, but the destruction of the Supreme Soviet clearly represented the beginning of the tide that would hurl the Europeans out of the continent.\n\nThe once-infamous Dogmeat General Zhang Zongchang, of course, had been biting his tongue whenever "our natural partnership with Nippon" came up. For him, Japan meant the destruction of his backers in the Fengtian Clique, and the start of the arduous march toward sobriety. While it had done nothing good for his temper, the old warlord had to admit the clarity of thought was welcome. For one, it had allowed him to see that joining Zongyuan on this quest would be better for his fortunes than being one general among many fighting over Mongolia.\n\nFurthermore, it allowed him to see that the bulk of the soldiers in their employ were essentially ethnic Chinese, and may find his thoughts on throwing the barbarians out of China more compelling than those of a Japanese puppet."
MNS.1.a:0 "Removing the ronin would be too dangerous."
MNS.1.b:0 "Zongchang's men gently dissuade the samurai."

#LEADER BIOS 

MNS_zhang_zongyuan_desc:0 "Zhang Zongyuan, another "ronin" seeking his path on the Asian continent, was born Date Junnosuke to a minor branch of the Date samurai clan. While his father was the governor of the Sendai Domain, and his grandfather served under the Emperor Meiji, his adolescence was inauspiciously messy. Narrowly having a prison sentence appealed down to probation after shooting a fellow youth in junior high, he would flit between multiple schools before dropping out of Waseda University. Prospects for the future looked questionable, until discussions with a Japanese spy and a Manchu prince dragged him into doing dirty work on behalf of the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\nDate's rap sheet, or service record depending on who you ask, criss-crosses the region. What started as brief involvement in a failed Manchu-Mongol Independence Movement to divide China and Zheltorossiya turned into involvement in multiple attempted assassinations - even against a Japanese Prime Minister in 1919. He also worked in operations against Korean bandits and nationalists for a few years before returning to China, where his objective of supporting regionalist movements against the Republic accidentally led to him becoming fast friends with Fengtien Clique general Zhang Zongchang. Date, in a fit of Pan-Asianist pique, changed his name and national identity to Chinese out of solidarity.\n\nWhen the Fengtien were obliterated, Zongyuan's networks in Shandong were disrupted as well, and he returned to operating within Japanese territory, plotting raids on Mongolia and Zheltorossiya. Unfortunately, Tokyo's attention being focused on domestic instability and the war with China meant that the would-be warlord was soon operating with very little oversight. Zongyuan was adventuring in Mongolia when Zheltorossiya broke apart, and the wayward noble saw an opportunity decades in the making. His youthful friendships with scholars such as Ikki Kita had potentially given his work an ideological character greater than simply supporting Japanese imperialism. Could Zheltorossiya be the new base area of Pan-Asian struggle? The world holds its breath as the ronin draws his sword once more."
MNS_zhang_zongchang_desc:0 "Zhang Zongchang, what a life you have lived. Born in Shandong to an alcoholic barber/trumpeter and a folk exorcist, he was destined for an unusual childhood. When his parents divorced in his teens, he and his mother would move to Harbin, where Zhang made ends meet as a bouncer, pickpocket, and prospector. Moving further into Siberia for work, he would end up serving as an auxiliary in the Russian army during the war with Japan, then end up a marginally pro-revolution bandit upon his return to China. Through the vagaries of military politics, he found himself commanding a division in 1913 after his immediate superior was executed for disloyalty, then worked for almost a decade to avoid the same fate.\n\nJoining the Fengtien Clique in 1922, Zhang made a strong first impression on the warlord leadership in Manchuria. Perhaps it was his experience in the 1905 war, but he proved a capable commander who could utilize his connections in the Russian Far East to get ahold of armored trains, medical staff, and foreign military instructors. On the other hand, the Fengtien's involvement in the Chinese drug trade heralded the darker aspects of the eventually-dubbed Dogmeat General. After being ejected from governing Shanghai, he was assigned to be the military governor of his home province of Shandong, a period which would become infamous for violence and hedonistic depravity.\n\nWhile the Northern Expedition failed, and the Fengtien were one of the two strongest warlord powers left in the north, the fortunes of his Clique immediately took a turn for the worse. With his army recovering from the Guomindang's offensive, Zhang was unprepared for what would transpire next. Fearing that Zhang Zuolin's son was seeking terms with the GMD, Japan and the Shanxi Clique launched a lightning campaign that laid waste to the Manchurian power base of the faction. Bending like a reed in the wind, Zhang Zongchang went to Beijing to swear fealty to Yan Xishan, and with his diminished portfolio he was left largely to plot against the GMD and dream about what could have been.\n\nSeemingly destined for obscurity, and nursing a years-long hangover, Zhang was sent north on the expedition to Mongolia. Now, with the fall of Zheltorossiya, the once-infamous 72-Cannon Chang sees a chance at redemption. The remains of the Fengtien ride forth into what is rightfully Chinese territory, to prove themselves heroes or die in the attempt."
