#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS
POLITICS_KALEDIN_DESC:0 "Kaledin takes pride in helping to maintain the autonomy of Don Cossacks within the Russian Empire. Most Russians are ignorant of the Cossack way of life, so it is nice for Kaledin to know that in his realm, the Cossack spirit still lives. However, this fragile peace is dependent on the precarious politics of the Russian Empire, and who knows how long that will last."
DKB_DESC_MENU:0 "With the advent of the Civil War, the South-Eastern Union was created, consisting mainly of a collection of Cossack hosts and various regional polities. Led by the old and trusted general Alexei Kaledin, the region was more or less protected from the turmoil of civil war with the greatest issue being the famine of 1921 following the Volga drought. Ever since then, Kaledin has more or less stayed in control of his little territory, and the nation has even grown wealthy from agricultural and industrial development. However, the results of the 1935 labour strikes across Russia hit hard, and Kaledin will be forced to address the varying issues facing the him."

#FOCUSES
DKB_krug_gathering:0 "The Krug Gathering"
DKB_krug_gathering_desc:0 "Times are changing in Russia and in Europe, and it's finally time for all of the factions in the confederation to convene and decide what's best for the hosts. The Chernomortsy, Lineytsy, Kaledintsy, and even the fringe Gorgulovites will be invited, and will all collectively decide what the Cossacks need: to continue with Kaledin and stay the course? To come closer to the new nation of Ukraine, and liberalize the nation? To drift back to Russia, centralize the state, and stay loyal to the capital? Or to tear it all down, and embrace a path of neo-Scythian conquest?"
DKB_chernomortsy_victorious:0 "Chernomortsy Victorious"
DKB_chernomortsy_victorious_desc:0 "It seems that the more liberal, pro-Ukrainian faction has won. Although a somewhat unexpected development, the choice may be justified; Cossacks have always been identified with the Ukrainian national character, and perhaps it is time that we sought to return to our roots."
DKB_kaledin_marches_forward:0 "Kaledin Marches Forward"
DKB_kaledin_marches_forward_desc:0 "Our chieftain, Alexei Kaledin, reigns victorious. The Krug has decided, correctly, to stay the course and continue with the man who has collected and solidified the connections of the Hosts which stand strong today. Let us put our faith in the man who created the nation and the man who will lead it to even greater heights!"

DKB_death_of_union_desc:0 "In an unlikely turn of events, the Chornomortsy and the Scythians have created a coalition in the Krug. The country is ablaze with protests and demonstrations against the current government, and the situation has not been made better with the disappearance of our chieftain Kaledin, and the death of the Scythist Gorgulov… collapse is imminent, and the experiment of our South Eastern Union is officially over."
DKB_gorgulov_at_stage:0 "Gorgulov on the Stage"
DKB_gorgulov_at_stage_desc:0 "Saddle the horses, string the bow, and blow the horn! Pavel Gorgulov has risen to lead our great nation from the muck and the mire. The unorthodox leader of the Scythists has been chosen by fate, the old gods of this ancient land smiling upon him. Let the capitalists and socialists quake in terror, let the Europeans quail in fear! A new age dawns in the Caucasus, now destiny will decide who lives to see the rest of the day."
DKB_officialize_ukrainian_education:0 "Officialize Ukrainian Education"
DKB_officialize_ukrainian_education_desc:0 "As part of our reforms, it is time to make official the new system of Cossack education: education in the language of Ukrainian, the traditional language of the Sich! While our Russian neighbours may be angered, the Union will do what it must do in regards to modernizing and rationalizing itself."
DKB_print_hryvnia:0 "Print Hryvnia"
DKB_print_hryvnia_desc:0 "If we are to come closer to our more Western and Ukrainian roots, we might as well start to symbolically and economically do so as well. By going from a more Russified currency to a distinctly Ukrainian one, we can both come closer to our Cossack roots and move further from the oppressive, Russian economic system."
DKB_drift_away_from_russia:0 "Drift Away from Russia"
DKB_drift_away_from_russia_desc:0 "The nation is starting to realize more and more, as well as our leadership, that moving away from Russia is the best decision for us. The sooner and the faster we can sever ourselves from that corrupt and dysfunctional collection of warlords, then the quicker we can start to pick ourselves up and see some real progress."
DKB_decentralize_military:0 "Decentralize our Military"
DKB_decentralize_military_desc:0 "Cossacks were always free and honorable people, and our current military should display the same traditions and values of that group. We are their inheritors, and we must remain true to that which has inspired the founding of our great country. My budemo kozakamy nazavzhdy!"
DKB_require_visa:0 "Require Immigrants to have a Visa"
DKB_require_visa_desc:0 "The nation must be wary of those who have no Cossack tradition to speak of. After all, those who have tried to share our lands throughout time have only sought to bring oppression upon our hosts. The Poles, the Russians, but no more! It's time we take the initiative and require immigrants to have visas immediately!"
DKB_land_of_freedom:0 "Land of Freedom"
DKB_land_of_freedom_desc:0 "No more will we endure any foreign control or internal, centralized authoritarianism. The South-Eastern Union is a free nation, a frontier, a great and open nation for her peoples to enjoy. Svoboda vsim nasolodzhuvatysya!"

DKB_free_trade_zone_of_taganrog:0 "Free Trade Zone of Taganrog"
DKB_free_trade_zone_of_taganrog_desc:0 "Taganrog, along the Black Sea on our Western border, is a major industrial center and an important port on the Sea of Azov. The economic potential of such an area, close to the borders of more Western nations, as well as on the Black Sea, is extremely great, and we should look into expanding our resources and efforts there. This should include, but not be limited to, establishing a zone of free trade to promote economic revival."
DKB_expand_donbass_coal_trade:0 "Expand Donbass Coal Trade"
DKB_expand_donbass_coal_trade_desc:0 "The Donbass is an area which is rich in natural resources, and since the industrial rejuvenation of the region in the late 19th and early 20th century, has been a great economic opportunity for those who have controlled and developed the region. So, we should take this chance to extend our trade elsewhere."
DKB_open_to_europe:0 "Open to Europe"
DKB_open_to_europe_desc:0 "Europe too will enjoy the fruits of our economic development. Perhaps, through opening our ports and our factories, our shops and our farms, then other developed nations too will see our value and our raw potential, not just our Russian counterparts in Petrograd. With these important connections, we can very well hope to see a freer and more prosperous Union!"
DKB_guns_for_caucasian_tatars:0 "Guns for Caucasian Tatars"
DKB_guns_for_caucasian_tatars_desc:0 "With our newfound money from our matured investments, we should accordingly pursue some opportunities in the south. The Baku region is one of the richest areas on the planet when it comes to oil, and with our ever increasing independence and influence, it is time for the Union to capitalize on the weaknesses of Centrocaspia. By arming the Azeris to the south, we can reliably instigate a pro-Union resistance, and start to control the flow of black gold in the Caucasus. Now is our time to seize the chance for greater economic salvation!"
DKB_union_of_all_peoples:0 "Union of All Peoples"
DKB_union_of_all_peoples_desc:0 "Now is not the time for division. With trouble brewing across the continent, all of the nations in the Union must come together and trust in Kaledin and in the path of independence which we have always taken. The Southern Steppes have always been a welcoming region, and we cannot afford to lose any help which we can get."
DKB_be_wary_of_change:0 "Be Wary of Change"
DKB_be_wary_of_change_desc:0 "The system which we have survived and grown under is not the problem that persists in our nation. Dangerous Accelerationists like Gorgulov and his kind, as well as other ideologies, must be silenced and cannot be indulged in order to ensure stability and progress for the nation."
DKB_invest_in_all_education:0 "Invest in all Education"
DKB_invest_in_all_education_desc:0 "Ukrainian, Russian, whatever our hosts decide to embrace, we must appreciate their decisions and fund their education. It's futile to try and standardize the language - we can't afford to lose time and separate our peoples. The sooner we educate everyone, the sooner we can rise to be a stable and regional power."
DKB_independent_diplomacy:0 "Independent Diplomacy"
DKB_independent_diplomacy_desc:0 "We mustn't depend on any other nation to let us onto the stage of world politics. With our modernization already underway, we can start to become a real power in the Caucasus region, and eventually, in the broader scope of Europe as well. By investing in our economy and opening up our influence to neighbouring countries, progress is certainly evident."
DKB_free_trade_zone_of_astrakhan:0 "Free Trade Zone of Astrakhan"
DKB_free_trade_zone_of_astrakhan_desc:0 "Just as Ivan the IV, or as he is better known, the Terrible, had conquered Astrakhan and founded a powerful and bustling city, so too shall we revive the region with new trade agreements, strengthening our Eastern oblasts with more activity and opportunity! Not only is this region of great potential, but it is also a chance to better connect ourselves to our Eastern neighbors, not only economically, but politically too."
DKB_expand_factory_tsaritsyn:0 "Expand Truck Factory in Tsaritsyn"
DKB_expand_factory_tsaritsyn_desc:0 "Tsaritsyn, on the mighty river Volga, has always been a great candidate for industrial investment, and the equipment and mechanical goods produced in the city have long been crucial for the economy of Russia. Now is the time to expand this city's industrial capacity, and to make the goods here known not only across all of Russia, but Europe and the rest of the world as well!"
DKB_open_to_world:0 "Open to World"
DKB_open_to_world_desc:0 "With the recent revitalization of our economic centres in the East, we have opened up even newer opportunities to offer our economic strengths to other nations all over the world, not just to Russia or to the Intermarium. We can exploit the frontier for our personal gain and the Union and her people will become richer than ever before!"
DKB_open_to_russia:0 "Open to Russia"
DKB_open_to_russia_desc:0 "Although it's great that we are getting greater economic outreach and growth, we shouldn't tempt other nations or alliances. Our responsibility should be to help our fellow Russians, and we should open up to them first, before all other nations surrounding us and in Europe. Besides, we have much to offer our brethren, and we are sure that they in turn have much to offer us!"
DKB_move_towards_centralism:0 "Move towards Centralism"
DKB_move_towards_centralism_desc:0 "For a strong nation, we need to have a strong and authoritative system of governance. Unlike the petty liberalization which the Chernomortsy would have preferred, we must begin to consolidate the power of the state under the Chieftain. All for the Union!"
DKB_officialize_russification:0 "Officialize Russification"
DKB_officialize_russification_desc:0 "The Cossack hosts in more recent history have been loyal to the Tsar, as the Tsar had been good to them. We must repay that favor, and with the recent events in Russia, staying together and consolidating our efforts with the main Russian faction in Moscow and Petrograd is a more important task than ever."
DKB_invite_settlers:0 "Invite Settlers from Central Russia"
DKB_invite_settlers_desc:0 "The Russians are our relatives, and we should be more welcoming towards them. After all, we have shared the land of Rus with them for so long, we are practically brothers. As a show of our cooperation, we should be willing to invite settlers to grace our lands, not only politically but economically as well."
DKB_continue_using_ruble:0 "Continue using Ruble"
DKB_continue_using_ruble_desc:0 "If it's not broken, why fix it? Our economic cooperation with Russia has brought us this far, and we have no reason to distance ourselves from them at this point. Continued usage of the Ruble will ensure continued growth in our economy, as well as maintaining good relations with our neighbors."
DKB_unify_our_troops:0 "Unify our Troops"
DKB_unify_our_troops_desc:0 "The South-Eastern Union's military needs reform if we are to be considered a worthy nation in the region, as well as a faithful and competent ally to the Russians in the north. Thus, we must undergo a program of unification and standardization in the military, including the forces of the Cossack hosts."
DKB_solve_separatist_problem:0 "Solve Separatist Problem"
DKB_solve_separatist_problem_desc:0 "Having any insurrectionary resistance in our nation is unacceptable, especially when it threatens our relations with our allies to such an extent. The Ukrainian bandits to the west and agitators on the fringes of our nation don't deserve to enjoy our nation if they seek to create division and ultimately provoke insurrection. We should crack down on them and cease their rabble-rousing."
DKB_loyal_south_east:0 "Loyal South East"
DKB_loyal_south_east_desc:0 "The Union was created in an attempt to preserve order in the region when Mother Russia was in trouble. Now that order is being restored, we must stay to the path that we are meant to go on, and remain loyal to the capital. It is not, and was never really our choice to become independent, but was a choice made out of necessity. Now, we mustn't stray from the path, but rather we must stay close to it more than ever."
DKB_stay_away_from_drozdovsky:0 "Stay Away from Drozdovsky's Feud"
DKB_stay_away_from_drozdovsky_desc:0 "The politics of the ambitious Drozdovsky and his ilk should be of no concern to us; and we should focus on our own politics in the Union. To give them any attention is to invite trouble, and at a time we should be forging our own path, this would contribute destructive and completely unnecessary consequences."
DKB_denounce_dutov:0 "Denounce Dutov's Weakness"
DKB_denounce_dutov_desc:0 "The weak and unstable government of Alexander Dutov is easily susceptible to a coup by Kazakh nationalists or extreme and reckless Eurasianists, and presents a grave danger on our northeastern border. Perhaps, it is time for a total regime change in Kazan..."
DKB_conquer_orenburg:0 "Conquer Kazan"
DKB_conquer_orenburg_desc:0 "Enough is enough! We cannot stand to tolerate the limp and ineffective rule in the Kazan Military District anymore.

dkb.1.t:0 "Russia's Little Slice of Limbo"
dkb.1.desc:0 "It is currently the Year of our Lord Nineteen Hundred and Thirty-Six. Although the saints have seen fit to preserve Holy Russia for the time being, its politics are frayed to a near-breaking point, and the Southeastern Union is no different. Governed by Don Cossack cavalry general Alexei Kaledin, the Southeastern Union is one of the few places in the Russian Empire which is governed by a leader from the local ethnic group. Still, however, many Cossacks yearn for an end to Russian rule, and the significant Ukrainian minority in the region is also making itself known. There are even whispers of men both within and without the government who seek to restore the ancient Scythian Empire… and while this is obviously ridiculous, the rumors are far too prevalent to be ignored. Such disunited politics, as well as a general disagreement over an ethnic identity for the Southeastern Union, have earned this warlord state the title, "Russia's Little Slice of Limbo", as the area seems in constant danger of becoming something brand new at any moment, and can't stick to one identity.\n\nEven as Kaledin continues to rule with an iron fist, he knows that time is running short for him and his band of merry men. All that it would take for the entire region to go up in flames is one false move or freak accident which could send the entire empire into collapse. And although Kaledin knows these things, he is determined to protect his realm and his people, just as he always has, down to his last breath."
dkb.1.a:0 "What the general may not know, is that his last breath may come sooner than he expects..."

dkb.2.t:0 "The Currency Issue"
dkb.2.desc:0 "The National Krug gathered today for the first of many debates which will determine the path of the Southeastern Union going forward. These debates will reform every aspect of the Southeastern Union, as well as demonstrating the efficiency of Cossack democracy. The first item on the agenda is what currency should be used by the region. Russian loyalists are suggesting we declare the Ruble as our official currency, as it has acted as our unofficial currency until now, and could draw us closer to the Russian Empire. Critics of this proposal have pointed out the decreasing value of the ruble, and though they haven't been able to reference it directly, references have been made to Russia's approaching collapse. Some have suggested that we switch to the Hryvnia, a Ukrainian currency which has greater value than the Ruble, and may offer us a path towards economic cooperation with the Intermarium. A third proposal suggests that we use only Chervonets, or large gold coins, and mint them using Ugric gold. None are quite sure where this proposal originated from, and some are wary that shadowy figures are trying to manipulate the Krug from the shadows. Despite this, many have supported this proposal, as the coins would offer economic stability while still being backed by the Ruble."
dkb.2.a:0 "We shall use the Ruble! Forward With the Empire!"
dkb.2.b:0 "The Hryvnia is the most pragmatic choice."
dkb.2.c:0 "Those Chervonets do look rather shiny..."

dkb.3.t:0 "Issue of Military"
dkb.3.desc:0 "As the South-Eastern Union looks towards a new future, so does it's army.\n The Union Krug has decided to look into potential ideas for improvement and reform of the Army, which as of now sits disorganized and with old weaponary. Perhaps, so thinks the Krug, that it is high time to debate this issue. And so, the debates began, with the Scythists beginning with an ambitious and radical ideal of total modernization of the Army, with new weapons coming in from more industrially privileged countries. The Chernomortsy retorts, saying that it's better to decentralize the Army and allow for a looser command chain, resulting in better coordination of local divisions, as they claim that the cost for these modernizations would be too much. The Lineytsy agree on the last part, yet believe that ever further centralization would be better for the organization of Divisions under one, united Army Command. And so begins the debate, as the Krug bickers, and eventually decides to vote. The deciding vote is cast, and..."
dkb.3.a:0 "The Centralization plan is chosen."
dkb.3.b:0 "The Decentralization plan is picked."
dkb.3.c:0 "Modernization is decided!"

dkb.4.t:0 "The Education Issue"
dkb.4.desc:0 "When imagining the Grand Russian Empire, one scarcely imagines its schools. And yet, the youth are perhaps the most powerful resource that the Empire possesses. Therefore, great care must be taken in reforming the Education system, lest we throw the Empire into chaos some 20 years from now when they graduate. The issue facing the Krug is what language school should be taught in. While the natural instinct is obviously to keep classes in Russian, many have pointed out that this is unfair to children who don't know Russian, as there is currently no public program to teach the language. The opposition has proposed instead that individual schools decide which language to teach in based on their students, which is seen by most as a fair compromise. However, the mysterious group who keeps making proposals to the Krug have struck once again, this time with a harsh proposition. Their proposal states that Russian schools should not only be taught only in Russian, but that only ethnic Russians should be able to attend. According to their logic, the "lesser races" of the Russian Empire are simply incapable of proper Russian education, so instead they should be given rudimentary education by their parents, and then used as a cheap, uneducated labor force. EVeryone in the Krug is outwardly horrified by this, but who knows how many Krug members this shadowy cult has influenced already…"
dkb.4.a:0 "Keep the lessons in Russian. The children will learn it, in time."
dkb.4.b:0 "Allows the schools to decide. No child left behind!"
dkb.4.c:0 "Russian schools are made by Russians, and they should be for Russians."

dkb.5.t:0 "The Issue of Internal Autonomy"
dkb.5.desc:0 "Throughout its history, the Russian Empire has graciously offered autonomy to certain communities who are either better off on their own, or simply can't be governed due to the sheer size of the Empire. The issue of to which extent this policy should continue has been brought before the Krug, as some believe these communities have become a bit too autonomous. It was generally believed that the Lineytsy proposal to strengthen the Union government would be the beginning and end of the discussion, but as always, the opposition argues to the contrary. Instead, they say local autonomy as a value of Russian Imperialism, and to disavow such a policy would be to disavow the Empire itself. Seemingly in response to this notion, a third proposal has once again made its way to the Krug, arguing for the total abolishment of autonomy altogether. This organization, who have revealed themselves as the Scythists, argue that a disunited empire is not truly an empire to begin with. They see the policy of autonomy as cowardice by the former Tsars, who did not have the courage to tame the peoples of the Russian wilds. These words are near-heresy to most Russian patriots, but few can still deny the influence of the Scythists."
dkb.5.a:0 "Strengthen the Union government!"
dkb.5.b:0 "Maintain local autonomy."
dkb.5.c:0 "Abolish all the autonomies!"

dkb.6.t:0 "The Issue of Political Refugees"
dkb.6.desc:0 "Along with the new era of radicalism in Europe came a wave of political refugees, all seeking safety and stability in our great Empire. However, there has been much debate over how many of them should be let in. Most agree that the Southeastern Union has some obligation to help these people, the question is to what extent their obligation extends. The Lineytsy have suggested that every refugee be let in, as they could prove useful as industrial or military manpower. The Chernomortsy, on the other hand, argue that the state need only protect Cossack dissidents, and that anyone else would simply be a burden. Shockingly, the Scythists have taken an almost identical stance, but instead arguing that only Russian dissidents be allowed in."
dkb.6.a:0 "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."

As the votes are cast, the feeling of tension between ethnicities and political groups becomes ever more palpable. It seems as though no matter what the result is, a period of unprecedented political violence is on the horizon. In an effort to somewhat avoid this, the previously divided factions of the Krug have declared an agreement to form a coalition government if there is no clear majority. However, it is unlikely that these makeshift alliances will last very long, especially if the ever ambitious Scythists are brought to power. Regardless, the Southeastern Union must respect the results of the election, whatever they may be…"

Polarization is at an all-time high, and it appears that one faction has emerged dominant over all others, as more members shift their allegiances according to the latest decisions made by the Krug. However, it might be decided that a coalition is best, resulting in an unprecedented amount of organization and solidarity amongst Inner Party members. And so, it is decided that through one final vote over a minor issue, it will be realized which faction is dominant. If two factions are as dominant as each other, they will be forced to make a coalition against the other, and like so, the fate of the South-Eastern Union hangs in the balance..."

The two, while getting into an argument, agree that they should try something unprecedented in the South-Eastern Union: A duel.\n\nThis duel will occur in a rural area near Elista, far away from Ekaterinodar's busy streets. The two prepare their pistols and look at each other, firmly standing their ground as hundreds of people around them observe in awe, knowing that one of them will come out dead, and the fate of the South-Eastern Union will be determined by a single bullet.\n\nAnd so, just like that..."

He, then looks at Grabbe, approaching closer as people around the two stay quiet, wondering what will happen next, careful to not upset whoever ends up winning the duel. Gorgulov breathes in and tiredly picks up Grabbe's other arm, helping him stand up after taking his gun.\n\n\"Take this as a rare kindness. You will continue your work as a military leader and I will maintain supremacy in the Krug.\"\n\n\"U-understood.\", said Grabbe, worried this might be a trick of some kind, and yet, everything he said seemed to be promised.\n\nA few days later while Grabbe was recovering  in the hospital, he already began his efforts in organizing divisions to help Gorgulov steer the South-Eastern Union to his goals, and so Gorgulov slowly removed Grabbe's influence, diminishing him to the status of a minor general."

Cheers could be heard, as they knew for sure Gorgulov had died. Grabbe looked at his enemy with disgust, and left him to rot in the ground, as people left for their homes. Some had refused to, with one of the crowd's members trying to get to Grabbe and enact revenge, but the local crowd stopped him before he could even see Grabbe. Grabbe, victorious, drove away to his hotel in Elista and would be going to Ekaterinodar tomorrow.\n\nIn Ekaterinodar, associates of the former Green Vozhd had been rioting, and yet it all felt very half-hearted. Gorgulov's urban supporters had largely given up due to lack of a Vozhd, and so did his rural supporters. It seems that Gorgulov will be just another piece of history."

dkb.17.desc:0 "Following the chaos within the South Eastern Union after the turbulent period of the collapse of the NPP, the assassination of Gorgulov and the storming of the Krug, the many ethnic groups of the Southern parts of the country have lost faith in the Union and declared independence, forming "The Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus".\n\nThe decision was announced earlier today by a council of representatives of the many ethnic and cultural groups of the Caucasus, such as the Avars, Chechens, Georgians, Iranians along with many others. Citing a lack of faith in the Union to protect the interest of minority groups as well as the general chaos of the political scene. The move has been welcomed by a substantial number of people in the South who have become disillusioned with the Union's government and have placed their faith in a governing entity which they feel will be more competent at meeting their needs and desires.\n\nThe same however cannot be said for the Union. The breakaway of the Mountain Republic has only added to dissatisfaction and political turmoil within the Union. Leading to a decision to mobilise forces stationed in the Terek region to try and subdue the rebellious republic. It remains to be seen if order will be restored, or if the façade of Central Authority will quickly collapse."

There was still unease however, the fact that the situation had become so dire that groups of the south went as far as to declare independence did not bode well for the Union's future. But the Republic continuing to exist would surely spell doom for the Union, an immediate end for them would certainly give the Union a sporting chance of coming back from the brink. \n\nOn account of the fact that the Mountain Republic was hastily formed making their armies a disorganised series of local militias, no one would have guessed that the Mountain Republic was long for this world, and certainly this was the case. The Mountain Republic's forces were nothing compared to Union forces. Defeat instead came from where it was least expected. Within the Union. \n\nWhen the order was announced for forces within Terek to march on the Mountain Republic, protest and outrage broke out within the ranks. There were various reasons for this. Some soldiers did not feel loyalty to a decaying and turbulent regime, others sympathised with the motives of the Mountain Republic and others seditious elements harboured Communist Sympathies. All these factors resulted in a mutiny against local officials and commanders ultimately resulting in the seizure of military barracks and government buildings in the city of Terek, leading to the creation of the Terek People's Republic and its declaration of independence from the Union.\n\nIt thus seems obvious now, that any facade of central authority is impossible to maintain. Unrest is rapidly spreading throughout the Union with reports of riots, skirmishes and protests breaking out across the nation. It certainly seems that the South Eastern Union is entering its final days."

There are still pockets of loyalist resistance in the countryside and various other cities. However, any military response beyond calling upon unorganised militias and volunteers seems difficult to achieve due in no small part to the near complete collapse of central authority within the Union and the sheer levels of unrest spreading throughout the nation.\n\nUnion leaders have even gone as far as to declare a general strike, paralysing the country and further preventing any effective action being taken. For now, we can only hope that the resistance to the Communists in Stavropol will at best be able to crush the Communist movement and at worst, delay the loss of the Stavropol province."

But the declaration of independence by the Ural Host makes such a course of action impossible. In fact, there have even been reports of some Cossack divisions raiding and assaulting parts of the countryside due to delayed payments which has resulted in some skirmishes between irregulars, the odd professional battalion of troops and Cossack divisions. This has had some positive effect, as anger towards Cossack aggression has led to some rise in volunteers in the army. \n\nBut it seems certain that these are only short term gains. In the long term, this is merely the final nail in the coffin for the Union. Without the Cossacks, Stavropol is lost and (obviously) so is the east. What little faith in the Union remained has completely collapsed."

We thus inform you of the decisions of the Kalmyk people to secede from the Union to declare The Republic of Kalmykia."\n\nTo the few remaining active governing bodies and individuals in the South-Eastern Union (many having decided to cut their losses and flee) the news of yet another secession from the Union has not come as much of a surprise. Some people have even been making bets on what the next entity to secede will be. The more dedicated members of government have issued no reaction to the secession. From nowhere in the Union are voices of protest or anger ringing out like they used too just a day or two ago. The people have grown tired of the turmoil and the chaos. The news has in a way had no effect on a nation that has grown desensitised to tragedy and turmoil. The streets in regions still belonging to the Union have for now grown quiet and tired seeking only an end to the turmoil that has torn the Caucasus apart.\n\nThe situation is of course much different in the new Kalmyk nation which has, to quote from the leaders of the independence movement for the Kalmyk people: "Been filled with jubilation as its people face an uncertain but still hopeful future for self-determination and progress, free from the chaos of bloated political disasters such as that of the South-Eastern Union, one where the Kalmyk people may be free from the oppression of imperial despots or corrupt warlords."\n\nThe traitors will live to see us die it would seem.

For it was not a day after the Kalmyk nation burst from the Union that radicals and fanatics had flooded the streets and fields of Tsaritsyn, lead under the banners of the radical Orthodox priest Sergei Trufanov. \n\nEver since the start of this whole blasted mess, Trufanov led sermons and marches in Tsaritsyn, decrying the Union as a state of godless degenerates. At first, only some superstitious fanatics attended. However, as the news of more and more republics and nations declaring independence started to pile and pile and pile and pile and pile. More and more and more and more and more people started to get attracted to the radical sermons and words of Trufanov after becoming disillusioned with the state of the Union, culminating in a cathartic release of the pent up frustrations of the past month as Trufanov's followers poured out into the streets in seemingly unending hordes, storming (at this point, largely empty) government buildings while shouting "Down with the Godless! Down with the Communists! Down with the Jews!"\n\nFollowing the seizure of power, Trufanov, from the city centre gave a speech to his dogmatic followers where he emphasised the rebirth of the city of Tsaritsyn and its liberation from godless degeneracy, Judeo-Communist corruption and remaining seditious political movements that may plague the area. A speech that has been met with thunderous applause and cheery responses from the crowd gathered. Of course, those who raised doubts on the takeover by Orthodox fundamentalists were quickly shut up, some disappearing overnight.\n\nRegardless, it is clear that the jewel of the Union, Tsaritsyn has fallen. News which at this point is hardly surprising, but tragic nonetheless."

As if the news of Trufanov's seizure of Tsaritsyn was not enough, it has come to pass that the governing bodies of the Astrakhan Province have reached a unanimous agreement of seceding from the union. What was once the most loyal and stable provinces of the South East Union has now completely broken away. \n\nFollowing the start of the troubles in the Union with the Mountain Republic's secession, the leadership of the Astrakhan province had grown uneasy, while wishing to remain loyal as possible, recent events have made this impossible. With the seizure of Tsaritsyn by Trufanov's mad dogs yesterday, the Astrakhan province was completely cut off from the Union's remnants, all but forcing its governing bodies to declare independence from the South Eastern Union and form the Astrakhan Governorate. Disillusioned with the once hopeful experiment that was an independent South-Eastern Union, the Astrakhan Governorate seeks, in the future, to become reunited with Russia, but as the Governorate is racked with instability from the incompetence of the governors of the country and province. as well as raids from the Ural Host and Tsaritsyn, such goals are recognised to be something for the future. For now the Governorate will seek to secure stability in the region, in order to prepare it for a reunification of the region so that it may swiftly be re-integrated into Russia. \n\nTechnically speaking, this is not new news. The Astrakhan Province had effectively become independent after chaos consumed the Krug, being subservient to the Krug only in writing. The facade was maintained for quite some time as it just so happened that the interests of the Astrakhan Province aligned with the goals of the South-Eastern Union. Of course, staying a de jure part of a rotting corpse was not something particularly attractive to the province, while it is likely that some level of cooperation will stay between the Governorate and the remnants of our Union, it is another shocking blow.

The Union is a shadow of what it used to be, being reduced to the two provinces of Kuban and Don. This is hardly surprising as these two provinces were the most stable areas within the Union, In fact the vast majority of volunteers that fought against the Stavropol uprising came from those provinces. However, now there is no pride to be found in fighting for the festering corpse that is the South Eastern Union, and following public gatherings and protests, there has been a mutual agreement of the two provinces parting their ways.  Certain self identified "strong men" have tried to take up the mantle of reunifying the versatile region that is the Caucasus, but few listen to them and fewer still have sided with them. That mantle has been taken up mostly by Astrakhan. The people of the Don and the Kuban have grown tired of the chaos of the last month and desire only for it to end so they may rest without worrying about maniacs taking control of the lives of millions or violent partisans plunging entire regions into chaos.\n\nAs a result, a document was signed in the city of Rosotov-on-Don which resulted in the formal end of the Union and the independence of the provinces of the Kuban and the Don. Despite the shadow that hung over the region for the last month, the people of the Don and the Kuban seem hopeful and joyful now that the days of terror and chaos seem to have gone. The only question in the heads of these people other than how they shall thank their blessings for escaping unscathed from chaos and anarchy is what part of the newly independent states shall they live in, which one shall excel and fly into the future as a safe and secure land for its people."
