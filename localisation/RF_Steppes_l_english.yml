steppe.1.t:0 "아크몰린스크 이상 없다"
steppe.1.desc:0 "It is a warm morning in the Wild West of Russia, and people across the Governorate have functioned for decades under Russia, but many of them have different ideas - the Ukrainian National People's Council, shortened to Ukrainian Council, seeks to further the interests of Ukrainian peassants living in rural areas and cities (but mostly rural areas) as equal members of the Russian Empire, although many radicals and even moderates in the Council wish, under the table of course, to seek total independence from Russia whenever the opportunity arises. The feeling is shared with Kirghiz and Kazakh intellectuals across the Governorate, as they either wish to be an equal part of the Russian Empire, or to entirely secede from it and create one of the only independent Turkic nations in the World. Some, however, such as the Cossacks, wish to create an independent Cossack State akin to Transbaikal, in the fringes of the Empire, as they create their own identity - be it for wealth and power, or as a real expression of their culture. As for less urban-minded Kazakhs and Kirghiz people, the idea of a Khanate seems largely appealing, as a way to bring back past glories."
steppe.1.a:0 "모두 괜찮아."
steppe.2.t:0 "Bumps in the Night"
steppe.2.desc:0 "Dark it was on the western border of Xinjiang that night as it always was. The wonder of electricity was a thing of legend, spoken of in hushed whispers from those who travelled far west or east. Neither did the light of other villages reach for nothing human surrounded the small settlement for a good fifty miles.\nCloaked in this impenetrable darkness that had already become alien to so many in the industrialized world, the nomads attacked. A good dozen riders waited far outside the settlement, whilst half of that had left behind their steeds and crawled slowly towards it, each carrying a pint of incendiary oil.\nA dirty trick really, their leader mused outside the village, not particularly fitting the martial prowess their legends lauded their ancestors for, but very fitting for the new age that was upon them. Even in the ancient texts great heroes had fallen in remarkably laughable ways, poison, drowning, illness or even an untreated wound. And now in an age where every snot nosed farm boy could shakily raise their rifle and strike down even the greatest of man, what had become of the legendary battles between men?\nTruly, this was a remarkably bad century for conquest and plunder but as they say technology breeds crime and so he and his men had adapted.\nHe did not charge in screaming like his ancestors did, instead he waited patiently till the newest members of his horde had set flame to the most fortified of homes. Sending their inhabitants running screaming into the streets where he and his men ran them over.\nWhen morning shook not much remained of the russo-kazhak settlement, the majority of its inhabitants either dead or enslaved. The smell of burnt flesh hanging heavily in the air. “Casualties?” he asked. “One sir, Adilet got crushed under burning wreckage when we stormed in.” “Enemy?” “Only civilians, not a single rifle or bullet in the whole settlement.”\nHe chuckled to himself, technology it seemed did not just breed crime but also excess. “Scour the ruins one last time, leave the corpses to rot, we leave at nightfall. We must leave quickly, change is in the air and I'd be damned if I miss it.” And truly the cogs of fate had already started turning in the endless steppes."
steppe.2.a:0 "This land is a wild one, and we need someone to tame it."
steppe.3.t:0 "슬라브지만 러시아는 아닌?"
steppe.3.desc:0 "스톨리핀의 농업 개혁과 사유농지 형성은 농업 노동층 사이의 재산보유량을 확대시켰지만, 모두가 승자는 아니었습니다. 지난 수십 년간 많은 이들의 재산은 줄어들었습니다. 콜차크 정부는 러시아 경제를 소생시키는 데 실패했고, 영국-미국발 공황, 평의회주의 경제고립, 국제불안정의 심화가 곡물시장 상황을 악화시키면서 it is no surprise that many have chosen to abandon small or marginal farms to seek greater prosperity on the larger farmsteads available in the East.\nBut all this is just as true in Ukraine as it is in Russia proper, and millions of Ukrainians have migrated east in the past decades. Many have settled in the ‘Grey Ukraine' region, a broad swath of which lies in our own Governorate. In the villages surrounding Omsk and Akmolinsk, they form a local majority, and more arrive every spring.\n\nThis is a matter of some controversy.\nMany Russian nationalists deny the existence of an independent Ukrainian nation; to this view, ‘Ukraine' simply a segment of the nation of Malorossiya. Malorossiya, along with Great Russia in the classical muscovite lands and White Russia to the west, forms the Triune Russian Nation.\nAs such, the movement of many Ukrainians into Siberia and central Asia presents a prime opportunity for Russification. As part of this program, they seek to have the General-Governorate formally classify all Slavic citizens as Russian, perhaps as a precursor towards universal use of the Cyrillic alphabet and the Russian language among the Slavs.\nObviously, this proposal is vociferously opposed by the Ukrainian Council. They see it as an effort to erase their unique cultural identity… and to block their attempt at forming a new Ukraine east of the Urals, or so their critics say. It is true that they have gained a great deal of influence, and the recent instability seems to have provided them with an opportunity to gain undue autonomy. Perhaps we should try to remove the source of conflict while we have the chance.\nThe Cossacks remain divided between Russian and Russified Turkic Cossacks and the Ukrainian Cossacks, and among them the matter is somewhat less important. The Alash and Nomads have little interest in the matter."
steppe.3.a:0 "They are merely one part of the Triune Russian Nation."
steppe.3.b:0 "This is excessive - I mean, we never wanted them anyway."
steppe.4.t:0 "유목민들을 위한 제안"
steppe.4.desc:0 "The village was too small to have a name of any concern to outsiders, and the meeting there was one of the stranger things to descend on the Kazakh steppe in recent years. Russian military men in full dress uniform posed for photographs with Nomad chieftains in anachronistic costumes; furs and leathers alongside high-powered rifles. Despite the perceived importance of the occasions, there were few reporters determined enough to reach the General-Governorate.\nThe process was elaborate, but the offer being made was simple. The Nomads would be given a range of subsidies and favorable loan agreements, along with a range of guarantees for their cultural liberties if they agreed to settle on the plots of land provided by the Governorate as peasants. More than a few within both the Division, the Ukrainian Council, and even the Cossack host grumbled about the divestment of land which could be granted to their own groups, but the Governorate faced many problems, and most could be ameliorated with more revenues.\nAmong the nomads, the response was mixed. The concept was not unprecedented; a trickle from among the Nomads had been settling down for the past several decades, leaving those most committed to transient living to make up the bulk of the population. But even they could not altogether deny that times were changing, and factions among the Kornliovites hoped that the downward pressure industrialization applied to the prices of beef, wool, and their other traditional products might gradually force the rootless people of the steppe into a more common economic role.\nOf course, those same pressures might instead encourage them to withdraw more completely from the society of the Russian Empire. The outcome of this meeting is highly uncertain, as are its long-term implications."
steppe.4.a:0 "Hopefully something good will come out of it."
steppe.5.t:0 "1936년 예산안 편성"
steppe.5.desc:0 "The time has come once again to prepare the annual budget for the Steppes Government. While nominally this task is purely Kornliov's prerogative, several interest groups wish to influence how the residual surplus in our incomes is spent. High-ranking officers in Kornliov's Division and influential men of the Semirechye Cossacks have both requested audiences with the leader to plead their cases. Kornliov's Division proposes an ambitious plan to import machine tools, with the goal of developing a self-sufficient military-industrial complex in the stable northern districts, to defend against disloyalty to the Empire - both foreign and domestic - along with the expected subsidies for Russian settlement. The Cossacks propose a more rural version of a fundamentally similar scheme, with the creation of dispersed workshops in the southern oblasts, along with the settlement of more Cossacks in the area to serve as a stabilizing force.Some Ukrainian sympathizers propose a number of modifications to the Kornliov's Division plan. They call for a greater emphasis on the development of light industry and the construction of civilian goods, as well as support for farmers. They also propose apparently superficial variations to the immigration incentives, which would result in homesteading opportunities in the General Government being primarily advertised in majority-Ukrainian regions. It is almost certain that the Ukrainian Council has had some influence on these ideas.Meanwhile, the Alash have written a circular which, while not explicitly associated with the budget discussion, is clearly intended to lay out their thoughts on the matter. They call for state support for their westernization efforts, particularly in funding the mechanization of their cotton farming and processing industry. They claim that textiles are an essential early step in industrialization, but it is undeniable that the money, and especially foreign currency reserves, that the cash crop would generate would greatly increase their influence over our state. Of course, we could try to satisfy everyone and direct some funding toward every proposal. This will almost certainly involve the government outspending its means without actually giving any one project enough money to succeed. No one would benefit from this, except perhaps those who have no interest in government budgets to begin with."

steppe.6.t:0 "Alone and in the Dark"
steppe.6.desc:0 "Marshal Lavr Kornilov sits at his desk in his study, alone. The isolation is a welcome reprieve from the constant bombardment of responsibilities that he has accepted as both a statesman and a military leader. Today, his advisors have told him to simply take the day off, claiming to care for his health. But if they truly knew anything about him, Kornilov thinks, they would know that he falls apart when he is alone. The facade of the Iron Marshal slips, and his mind is allowed to race with anxious thoughts. And today, these anxious thoughts are about the Steppes, specifically their future. Kornilov runs his hands through what is left of his hair as he ponders the possibilities: How long could his iron grip possibly hold? When it falters, will the Ukrainian Council overthrow the government, putting another Ukrainian ethno-state on the map. Or perhaps the Alash party will claim victory, bringing Kazakh independence, and republican independence at that. Or perhaps, if he played his cards right, he could keep his fist securely around the throats of his enemies, even if it meant choking the life out of the Steppes. All that matters to the Marshal is maintaining his position, for he is far too deep in the Russian administration to fail now. No… Kornilov will succeed in taming these wild lands, these unruly people, no matter the cost. And he will surely succeed, for God has seen to it. Otherwise, how could this nervous wreck of a man have possibly made it this far? Kornilov shambles over to a bottle of whiskey and pours himself a glass, lighting a cigar as he does so. As the alcohol and nicotine converge on his fragile nervous system, he makes a realization. Nothing matters. Not him, not Kolchak, not the savages, none of it. All that mattered was the Will of God. God had carried Russia this far, and He would carry Kornilov until his death. At first, this thought comforted the aging man. But as his eyes lowered to sleep, he was suddenly awakened by a seering thought."

steppe.8.t:0 "The Scarlet Revolution"
steppe.8.desc:0 "At 10 o'clock today, from the top of a tram heading out of Akmolinsk, Vitaly Prymakov, Chairman of the Ukrainian Council announced to ecstatic masses of the official transferral of power from Kornilov to the Ukrainian Council.\nThe Ukrainian Council is a coalition of proponents of the ideals of Democratic Socialism and more moderate forms of Marxist thought. The origins of the Council come predominantly from the Ukrainian population that had settled within the Governorate, but recently has grown to receive support from various Turkic groups, Russians and even a not insignificant number of Cossacks.\nSupport for the Ukrainian Council hadn't been fantastically high until a few weeks ago, when a series of letters and documents had been leaked to the press detailing a vast and extensive scandal in the Governorate among business owners, the contents of the documents spoke of acts of money laundering, human trafficking, smuggling, corruption, bribery, wage theft and many more criminal offences. Even more atrociously, small business owners, landowners and even various higher up government officials were heavily involved in the scandal. The scandal, which has been dubbed as “The Karagandy Affair” directly led to the misuse of state funding, so that funds that would have been spent on boosting infrastructure, developing poverty-stricken districts in major cities instead went directly into the pockets of those involved.\nUnderstandably this created significant outcry among the population, and the Ukrainian Council was on the forefront of condemning the affair and organising outraged sectors of the population. This caused a significant boost in support for the Ukrainian Council, especially after the whistle-blower responsible for outing the scandal, Vitali Gubarev was assassinated by masked assailants in his apartment. Further investigation ended up revealing that the murderers were connected to individuals involved in the scandal. The murder of Gubarev, led to a massive rise in support for the Ukrainian Council who immediately pounced on the opportunity to lambast the government for being unable to respond to the crisis and demanding the people behind it be brought to justice. Not long after, rioting, strikes, protests and even an attempted assassination on Kornilov rocked the Governorate and led to Kornilov attempting to flee Akmolinsk. However, the tram he was on was stopped by workers, and Vitaly Prymakov among other members of the Ukrainian Council boarded and negotiated with Kornilov, resulting in Kornilov agreeing to peacefully surrender power to the Ukrainian Council.\nAcross the Governorate, workers, the homeless and the neglected look on in hope at the dawn of the Scarlet Revolution as a new sense of serenity and justice begins to cover the new nation."
steppe.8.a:0 "The people of the Steppe have stood up!"
steppe.9.t:0 "알라쉬국의 탄생"
steppe.9.desc:0 "In what is sure to be a historic meeting today, Kornilov, the Governorate of the General Governorate of the Steppes met with Alikhan Bukeikhanov, the leader of a Turkic movement known as the “Alash State” who seek a government more representative of the Turkic population in the region. The movement has become famous and popular among the Governorate for the entirely peaceful nature of the movement, which condemned any acts of violence by and against any group no matter their political stance or cultural background. The movement obviously gained support at once from settled Turkic groups, Muslims and eventually from peasants  and poverty-stricken individuals due to the opening of soup kitchens and promises of expanding the welfare-state among other centre-left policies which have proven to be exceedingly popular among disenfranchised parts of the governorates population.\nThe Alash State has assured the entirety of the Governorate that they have no wish to side-line minorities such as the Russians or the Cossacks and aim for equal representation and opportunities for all in the Steppe. A stance which has gained it support from even moderate Cossacks but scepticism from more radical Nomad organisations.\nThe vast amount of support the Alash State has been getting has encouraged Kornilov to meet with the leaders of movement, holding a series of summits that have culminated in the shocking decision by Kornilov to cede power to the Alash State. Experts have speculated that Kornilov may have feared significant civil unrest had more power not been given over, others have speculated that Kornilov may feel that rule by such a peaceful and civilised movement that managed to turn over even some Cossacks would be best for the region. Whatever the case may be, one thing is for certain. Amidst the curses of Cossack Atamans and the joyousness of the Muslims, a new dawn has broken in the Steppe."
steppe.9.a:0 "A pleasant surprise."
steppe.10.t:0 "모든 게 괜찮을 거야, 지금처럼 앞으로도"
steppe.10.desc:0 "As a new day dawned in the Governorate, loyalists to Kornilov and those who did not wish to be bothered by political conflict breathed a collective sigh of relief. After weeks of heightened tension and factionalism that threatened to tear the Governorate asunder, the signs of stability began to slowly reappear as the shadows of opportunists, idealists, reactionary brutes and Councilist leeches began to fade.\nFollowing the attack on Kolchak and the start of Drozodovsky's resulting coup from Novorossiya, Moscow's authority in almost all of its subjects quickly disintegrated. Kornilov took the opportunity of a lack of pressure from above him and had the leaders of various political organisations within the Governorate arrested. Normally, this would have prompted some type of revolt against the Kornilov Division, however the disparate parties were too busy fighting each other for political dominance that they more or less lacked enough support from the public to prompt any significant response other than a few disgruntled journalists and a small riot here and there. Overall, nothing too out of the ordinary for the Governorate.\nA few hours later after the arrests, Kornilov made an announcement from Akmolinsk via radio to all in the Governorate who could hear, announcing a new dawn for the Governorate, one marked by stability and progress now that “the heads of the worms had been cut and burned before they could grow into snakes”. The speech lasted an unprecedented 2 hours but essentially amounted to how Kornilov would not allow such a situation to plague the Governorate again and thus would make moves to act against opportunists from all across the political spectrum which may threaten the stability of the Governorate. In an event that was no doubt chilling for the members of the Kornilov Division who heard it was the finishing line that this would include “Opportunists within the Kornilov Division.”\nAn atmosphere of calm and relief had settled on the Governorate, though the threat of purges even if it was only against political ring-leaders couldn't help but create a sense of unease among the populace. What awaits the Governorate, no one can know for sure, but it certainly seems that Kornilov is here to stay."
steppe.10.a:0 "반역자들과 기만자들을 위한 나라는 없다."
steppe.11.t:0 "굴리도프 정변"
steppe.11.desc:0 "In an event which many had seen coming for quite some time the Kornilov Division who elected General Gulidov has taken over the Governorate of the Steppes, wrestling control from Kornilov in a mostly bloodless coup.\nhile a takeover of an entity in a situation like that of the Governorate by strong military leaders is hardly anything new in human history and despite how expected it may have been, many people cannot help but feel rather confused and surprised at the turn of events. The main reason for this stems from the fact that the Kornilov Division is a faction that was meant to not meddle in politics. Of course, the reality of the situation away from public eye (and sometimes even in front) was radically different with the Kornilov Division being the de facto party of the government. A situation approved by Moscow due to its Pro-Russian leanings.\nThe process that allowed the takeover to take place in the first place began after General Gulidov was elected Chairman of the Kornilov Division. An event which began increased pressure on dissident groups from across the political spectrum. Whether they were Nomad Reactionaries or Ukrainian Reds, if they weren't loyal to the current government, Gulidov made sure they were put under a tight leash. Presses were censored, and overnight in major cities across the Governorate posters appeared encouraging people to join the division as well as posters lambasting political opposition and elevating Kornilov into an almost cult like stature.\nThese manoeuvres over the past few months have raised public support for and the power of the Kornilov Division significantly culminating today in a takeover of power led by Gulidov that has ousted Kornilov. Due to the significant amount of power the Kornilov Division had amassed they were able to take over Akmolinsk and depose Kornilov in a more or less bloodless coup, resulting in only injuries from minor skirmishes. Analysts have raised various reasons for the coup. Some cite a distrust of Kornilov's ability to manage the Governorate, others say that Kornilov has outlived his usefulness. Though strangely, Gulidov seems determined to carry on the cult of his predecessor despite his recent actions.\nWhatever the case may be, it is undeniable that Gulidov and the Kornilov Division have asserted themselves and are not likely to go anywhere anytime soon."

steppe.12.desc:0 "Worrying news from our border regions today as Cossack regiments rode over the Irtysh in a clash against armed Nomadic groups. Tensions between Russians and native Turco-Mongol tribes had always been at least a little strained, but relatively harmless feuds between those two groups could never hold much of a candle to the contempt between them and the Cossacks. Skirmishes had often broken out between villages, sometimes the odd clan of bandits would come and raid farms and small towns for food, money or weapons, or give the leaders of whatever group a good scare in response to some offending action. These occurrences were indeed a nuisance but nothing that could not easily be handled.\nThat is, until now. Today, the biggest clash between the Cossacks and Nomads occurred over mainly a disputed piece of territory in the Eastern parts of the country but was also influenced by religious differences between the Orthodox Cossacks and the Muslim (and sometimes Tengriist) Nomads. The skirmish at first seemed to be yet another minor tragedy.  Something that Kornilov would need to make another “heartfelt” speech on, asking for peace and co-operation between the two groups, a formality that would be addressed and the only thing the government would see about it until the next incident would either be a time of some semblance of unity or quiet bickering between the feuding groups.\nBut today saw no ordinary incident, the clash between the Cossacks and the Nomads, while starting of small, rapidly escalated into a huge battle. As it occurred near various villages, towns and even cities it was easy for people to join in. At first, it was the overly zealous, then it was their friends and family who saw them fall against enemy fire and steel, and not long after, it was everyone else. The death toll is currently estimated to be at around 3000, with many more injured. News of the battle rapidly has spread throughout the Governorate and already we are hearing news of riots, lynching's and communal violence in response.\nWith tensions rising rapidly, and local conflicts quickly escalating, a peaceful solution becomes increasingly unlikely. There are even rumours of the Cossack Ataman Annenkov calling for an open rebellion against not only the Nomads but also the Governorate, which he despises for even allowing the Nomads to exist. The aspiring Khagan of the Nomadic groups, Imanov, has openly declared war against Cossacks across the Governorate and seeks to depose even Kornilov in order to assert the independence of Nomadic Turco-Mongols from Russian domination. And caught in the middle are forces who have stayed loyal to Kornilov and the Governorate who seek for the status quo to remain in place and, hopefully, one day bring stability to a volatile nation.\nWho will emerge victorious from the coming conflict is anyone's guess, but what remains certain is that the General Governorate has hell ahead of it."

steppe.103.t:0 "“Ukrainian Culture” Clubs?"
steppe.103.desc:0 "A new trend in the Steppes General Governorate has seen Ukrainian cultural clubs popping up in numerous urban areas. The popularity and prevalence of these clubs is growing rapidly, causing some concern over the Steppes drifting away from Russian influence. Those who attend the club meetings have assured officials that there is no conception of a hostile takeover by the Ukrainian minority, and that they are simply attempting to preserve and celebrate their personal customs. However, most government members are still suspicious, and Lavr Kornilov is hardly a man to deny a chance to stomp out dissent. However, there has been some debate as to how this conflict should be handled. The Ukrainian Council has suggested that the clubs be allowed to operate under Russian supervision, though their request can obviously be seen as biased. Additionally, an even more radical idea from the Alash party suggests that every major ethnic group in the Steppes should have cultural clubs, including Russians. This idea goes a bit far for some, but also offers us a chance to drown out Ukrainian influence in our region, as well as an opportunity to directly sponsor Russification efforts. The choice falls upon Marshal Kornilov, whose personal solution is to simply outlaw these clubs altogether and be done with it. However, Kornilov is also aware that further antagonizing his opponents may lead to even further division. Thus, the choice remains..."

steppe.104.t:0 "This village is under threat"
steppe.104.desc:0 "Complaints arrive today from a village in Karaganda. Their complaints border on the stereotypical - insufficient rainfall for crop growth and livestock support triggering a series of crop failures and heard diseases, with the net result that the village is in acute need of aid. While this sort of thing would normally be managed at the regional level, in this case the regional authorities have refused to take action. The village in question is a Ukrainian wildcat settlement, established without the approval and outside the oversight of the authorities of the General-Governorate, though few have any doubts that the Ukrainian Council was involved, at least in the background. As such, the regional authorities have claimed that they have no obligation to assist individuals who are not, in fact, residents of the Steppes General-Governorate at all, and certainly do not contribute any tax to our coffers.\nWhile the ultimate fate of this settlement is ultimately insignificant to almost everyone outside of the village, our decision on whether or not to provide aid will set an important precedent. More liberal members of the administration argue that it is to our economic benefit to support all settlers from the western empire, even if they are Ukrainians - who will, they say, be assimilated into the majority Russian culture within a few decades separated from their traditional community structures. More moderate advisors warn of the danger of capitulating to a fait accompli by the Ukrainian Council; providing aid may be seen as indicating that we will not block their efforts to increasingly Ukrainianize our region. One student of history warns of the danger of allowing the formation - or, more realistically, the expansion - of Ukrainian parallel societies, which would allow them to maintain a distinct separatist culture and identity within our domain. \nOf course, surely the idea of a ‘new Ukraine' being created here in central Asia is absurd, and the people do need help."

steppe.105.desc:0 "With the recent formation of the Ukrainian Self-Defense Squads by the Ukrainian Council, the rural areas of the Steppes have been set ablaze with ethnic violence. Reactionary nationalists have relentlessly attacked the squads without remorse, and those who stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian minority have come to their aid with equal fervor. Thus, a conflict between the groups known as the White Cossacks and the Red Cossacks has begun to rage throughout the countryside. Despite styling themselves after the Russian Civil War, the two groups have only tangential similarities to their namesakes. The Red Cossacks often remind the public that they are not Bolsheviks, and that they generally support the reformist socialism of the Ukrainian Council. The White Cossacks, like the White army, oppose Bolshevism, but are not as transfixed on a Monarchist Russia, and do not generally endorse Kolchak and his regime. It seems as though, despite the best efforts of Kornilov and his government, a repeat of the Civil War is playing out before our very eyes. The Ukrainian Council claims no responsibility for the violence, instead pointing the finger at Russian Imperial policies which have left minorities divided for ages."

steppe.109.desc:0 "Today, in the capitol city of Akmolinsk, a brawl broke out between a drunk Russian man who had hurled racial insults at a Cossack man, who also happened to be extremely drunk at the time. As soon as the fight began, two police officers intervened in the fight, one a Russian who had been with his department for 25 years, and the other a newly recruited Cossack officer who had been assigned as his partner. Reportedly, it did not take long for both officers to take the side of their respective ethnicity, which eventually led to the policemen fighting alongside the two men. Immediately after this, a massive street brawl broke out, and soon, no one could even tell who was Russian and who was Cossack. Instead, a cloud of swinging fists had formed in the street, with men of all degrees of sobriety attacking each other without discrimination. That is, until a nearby resident of Akmolinsk called the authorities, at which point the Army battalion stationed in the capitol was forced to intervene. Kornilov himself even made an appearance, publicly shaming everyone involved for their stupidity and violence. As a result of the incident, the Cossack officer was fired, as it was decided that he had been the initial cause of the mass brawl. However, several vocal critics have pointed out the unfairness of firing the Cossack officer when the Russian officer was equally at fault. This incident has already sparked numerous protests which are expected to intensify in the coming weeks. One thing that is well-known is that the incident was likely an extension of the recent trend of increased Cossack influence, and growing Russian resentment of this trend."

steppe.110.t:0 "A Peculiar Land Dispute"
steppe.110.desc:0 "A series of appeals have brought the latest iteration of a frequent dispute to Kornliov's Desk. Two years ago, a cossack farmer - a veteran of both the Velikya Voyna and the civil war - has added several acres of hand to his homestead, including a reliable spring, and enclosed them with a wire fence. As the lands have no legal owner, such industriousness would normally be applauded, but the Nomads have raised a vocal objection. They attest that lands are part of the traditional migration route of a constituent tribe, and accordingly claim traditional ownership over them.\n\nThe cossack farmer claims he needs the land to support his growing family, and that nomads merely wish to take the property now that he has begun to improve it. The nomads counter that they simply migrated along a different route previous years. Without a written record of ownership claims are nearly impossible to verify. \n\nHowever the matter is decided, a decision by our leader will create a precedent in future land tenure cases. The Ukrainian Council likely wishes to advance the interests of peasants from their homeland seeking land ownership and better lives on the frontier, and Kornliov’s Division likely wishes to create similar opportunities for the Russian people. Both have organized small demonstrations in Akmolinsk in support of the farmer, and both have offered to create ostensibly neutral ‘oversight committees’ to handle this matter, and similar cases going forward. Though it might diffuse the situation, it would give the group chose no small measure of power over the future of our state. While news of the popular reaction from the outer steppes is more scarce, the Alash have thus far been divided between anti-pastoral westernizers and those who wish to present a unified front against the Slavs. \n\nSeveral prominent Akmolinsk businessmen have come forward urging us to push agricultural development forward, while a few of Kornliov's officers have raised concerns about the potential danger of Turkic retaliation."

steppe.111.desc:0 "Gunfire split the morning silence of the Kazakh steppe as the two bands of horsemen opened fire. Shouts rose, followed by screaming, as men dismounted and dove for cover. The erratic thunder lasted only a few minutes before the Cossack horsemen gained the upper hand, their irregular opponents breaking and running for the wilderness of central Asia in the face of stiff resistance.\nThis most recent border skirmish is only one item in a list which has grown rapidly ever since our decision to empower the Cossacks to defend the borders of the Empire within our jurisdiction. They have swiftly discovered and begun hunting a myriad of bands raiding from the chaotic and war-torn lands of Turkistan, which our previous corrupt officials and tribal service men had apparently neglected.\nWhile stopping these brigands should stabilize the region, it has stirred controversy as the Cossacks have accused, with some evidence, several prominent Turkic and Kazakh officials and tribal leaders of intentionally neglecting to bring their raiding kinsmen to justice. The Alash leadership have formally denied the claims, but several independent writers have actually come out in support of the raiders. They site the ongoing food security issues outside the Empire as justifying the brigands, and claim the Cossacks are attempting to exploit the crisis to legally remove their rivals for dominance on the outer steppes. While these claims are seen as borderline-treasonous in mainstream society, it is undeniable that making the arrests the Cossacks demand will advance their position."

steppe.113.desc:0 "A peculiar case has come to Akmolinsk. In recent months, the Balkash region has been plagued by a string of violent robberies. The prototypical target of the bandits is a successful small-holder; wealthy enough to have livestock and a few valuables, but not rich enough to afford armed guards. The gang is well-organized; they strike quickly in the depth of night, slaughtering their victim, his family, and any hired laborers he might employ before splitting up. Part of the gang rides off with the livestock, while the rest loot any movable valuables that can be found. Or so we assume - no one has yet witnessed their gristly work and survived. The criminals are also well- armed, moving quickly through the backcountry and striking their preferred targets with impressive precision. \n\nA more disturbing facet of the robberies is the fire. Somehow, the fields of the farm targeted reliably burst into flame hours after the gang is gone, burying their tracks in ash but not giving warning of their presence. It’s not clear how they’re doing this, but many of the peasants have begun to whisper that these criminals are in truth demons of the steppe. Infernal or not, failure to stop these criminals is an ongoing embarrassment to our government, and their continued actions erode our legitimacy among the farmers. \n\nNow, however, we might have a chance to stop them. A Russian farmer on the shores of Lake Balkhash has come forward, claiming to have seen one of his neighbors snooping around on his property, and later seen the same man conversing with a pair of well-armed strangers in nomad’s garb. He claims this man - a Kirghiz nomad who settled down to take up agriculture some years back, with middling success - is an informant for the gang, providing them information in exchange for protection, a cut of the loot, and the opportunity to claim pieces of their victim’s land. The Kirghiz man claims that he’s being framed, and it does seem odd that his neighbor could see him engaging in such openly suspicious behavior and escape. But then, the ex-Nomad has very nice boots for a struggling farmer, and resolving this matter might be worth taking a few risks. \n\nAbsent clear evidence to support anyone’s claims, the decision rests on the judgment of General Kornliov. How does he decide?"

steppe.114.desc:0 "A detective on a long-term investigation mission along the southern and eastern borders has returned to the capital today with a comprehensive report on a significant challenge to our government - smuggling. While we've as much as known for some time, we now have concrete proof that the nomads who have resisted settlement efforts are engaging in the large-scale transport of cattle into the warlord states of central Asia and west China. Obviously, they are paying no customs duties on these heads. Given the difficulty of conducting commerce in such unstable lands, this is obviously an attempt to undermine the legitimacy and authority of our government. \nWhile obviously must put a stop to this, controlling the outer border is deceptively difficult. It is far from our civilized population centers, and the paucity of roads and railroads makes any large-scale operation challenging. This sort of harsh environment is where the Cossacks excel, and the mobility of their cavalrymen makes them well-suited for running down criminals. However, granting them jurisdiction over this matter will further cement their control of the southern oblasts of the Governate; some within our government mutter that the autonomy they have is already excessive. \nWe could take an alternative approach. Kornliov's Division or the Alash could be deployed in an effort to curb this behavior via punishment and deterrence - granting them leave to take the necessary steps would empower the chosen faction in the region which - especially in the case of the Alash - may be no better than empowering the Cossacks. \nOf course, we don't need to stop the smugglers. If the taxes they are evading went away, they'd no longer be smugglers. Warnings are pouring in from all corners of the government about the risks of capitulating to subversive elements, who will most likely be emboldened to make further demands. In any case, to provide a smokescreen for the move we'd need to conceal it within a large reduction of customs fees and tariffs, which will have dire consequences for our budget."

STE_question_peasants_russianess:0 "Shall we question the Russianness of our Peasants?"
STE_question_peasants_russianess_desc:0 "The peasants of this land, however small their numbers may be, are of the Russian blood and speak the language descending from the tongues of the Kievan Rus'. Or do they?"
STE_end_triune_nation_policy:0 "End the \"Triune Nation\" Policy?"
STE_end_triune_nation_policy_desc:0 "The policy of Triume Russia; the concept of the great motherland as being composed of Great Russia, Little Russia, and White Russia, is an ideology that has found relevancy in many regions of Russia. However, many doubt that its use in official propaganda amongst nomads and other distinctly non-Russian groups would have much impact on these populations. We must decide the future of Triume Russia as a part of official Governatore propaganda."
STE_draft_1936_budget:0 "1936년 예산안 책정"
STE_draft_1936_budget_desc:0 "The budget is an essential part of the functioning of every nation, and the Governorate of the Steppes is no difference. Of particular importance this year are investments into the north and arms and munitions manufacturing, so that we don't have to rely on Petrograd's aid to defend ourselves."
STE_help_nomads_settle_down:0 "Shall we help nomads settle down?"
STE_help_nomads_settle_down_desc:0 "The nomads of the steppes and their refusal to stay in any place for too long remind many of the ruling class of the Governatore's binding to an ancient past from which it cannot move forward from. If we give them incentives to settle down, perhaps they would be a little more interested in helping in moving Siberia from it's empty past to a bright modern future."
STE_cooperate_with_orda:0 "알라쉬 오르다와의 협업?"
STE_cooperate_with_orda_desc:0 "Alash Orda, that hive of nationalist progressive rabble-rousers, could be useful in containing the more anti-Russian elements of our society. Of course we don't want them to have too much power, but they should reap some benefits if we're going to collaborate with them."
STE_kornilovs_day_alone:0 "Kornilov's Day Alone"
STE_kornilovs_day_alone_desc:0 "It is the hour of pondering for Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov. The man behind it all will take the time to make his final decisions; to confer with trusted advisors and to bicker with reluctant allies. Whatever he does today will determine the future of the General Governatore; all eyes are on him."
STE_steady_as_she_goes:0 "Steady as she goes \n...I guess."
STE_steady_as_she_goes_desc:0 "The Governatore is like a great, well managed ship. The personnel know what they are doing. The mappers have charted out a path for the foreseeable future. And above all, the captain, the man in charge, has everything under a firm yet delicate control."

STE_news_from_european_russia_desc:0 "Whispers of the instability of the Petrograd regime have been flowing to us for quite a while now, and we shall continue receiving reports of strikes, famines, political violence, and other nonsense that is solely present in the west. Of course, such tragedy and horrors would never be allowed to occur here."
STE_ukrainian_demonstrations:0 "아크몰린스크에서의 우크라이나인 시위"
STE_ukrainian_demonstrations_desc:0 "No oppression could last forever, and when an increasingly influential Ukrainian community didn't receive any recognition from the bureaucrats of Russian Imperial administration, an uprising of some sort became inevitable. Thanks God, current demonstrations appear to be peaceful, and it seems that Kornilov, who has some sympathy towards the demonstrators, is going to hand over the reins of power peacefully to the Ukrainians - for whatever future awaits the Steppe under them."
STE_kazahs_invited_into_administration:0 "개화 카자흐인들을 위한 행정직 제안"
STE_kazahs_invited_into_administration_desc:0 "The influence of Kirghiz, or as they call themselves Kazakh, nationalists is too big by now for the Governorate's authority to ignore them. Therefore, representatives of this “Alash” movement should be invited to govern these lands alongside our professionals - even if a new republic shall be formed, there will be no response from Petrograd or Moscow anyway."

No more petty factionalism, no more pesky separatists and scheming monarchists - his excellency's quest towards summoning of a new Constituent Assembly, an honorable mission for Free Russia's resurrection as a Republic, this noble endeavor is about to truly begin. Arise oh Russia from your bondage!"

However, it seems they have some questions about Kornilov and his way of running things, and it seems many of these inquiries are thinly veiled demands, and they don't look good for Kornilov..."

Non native settlers are being expelled, while Russian forces and civilians retreat by horse, by foot and by rail-motor; the era of Russian hegemony is coming to an end - or so those savages like to claim."

STE_ukrainian_council_elected:0 "우크라이나인 다수의 평의회 선출"

STE_promote_farming_cooperatives:0 "Promote Farming Cooperatives"
STE_promote_farming_cooperatives_desc:0 "Farming cooperatives are tools we can use to transform our agricultural system to a socialist one from the old ways, dominated by the bourgeois land-owners."
STE_military_of_grey_ukraine:0 "회색 우크라이나의 군대"
STE_military_of_grey_ukraine_desc:0 "Our military should not be filled to the brim with untrained conscripts and outdated equipment like decrepit Russia, but instead composed of small divisions of well trained and highly motivated soldiers with modern munitions and tactics adopted to defend their native land."
STE_ukrainize_existing_divisions:0 "현존 사단의 우크라이나화"
STE_ukrainize_existing_divisions_desc:0 "Ukranian will be the standard language spoken across the peoples of the steppes, and the military should be no different."
STE_update_military_industry:0 "군수산업 갱신"
STE_update_military_industry_desc:0 "Let's face it: there is not enough military-focused industry for our army to be well equipped and ready to defend if the perfidious Muscovites decide to invade. We should invest in building a complex of sorts to address this."
STE_new_general_staff:0 "새 참모진"
STE_new_general_staff_desc:0 "The old staff is beholden to Kornilov and the reactionary Russian military. With them gone, we need new blood to command our armed forces."
STE_open_politics_further:0 "Open up the Politics further"
STE_open_politics_further_desc:0 "The governance of the steppes should not be limited to the very highest elite, but towards the educated intellectuals who have interest in running the society."
STE_form_local_councils:0 "Form Local Councils"
STE_form_local_councils_desc:0 "Local councils should be set up; this way burden on the central government can be relieved while the locals have greater autonomy in determining their affairs."
STE_restrict_former_elites:0 "Restrict the Former Elites"
STE_restrict_former_elites_desc:0 "We know that the elites of the old regime want to destroy our newly built socialism. With a couple of arrests here and a couple of raids here, their leaders will understand that they are no longer welcomed here."
STE_demsoc:0 "Democratic Socialism"
STE_demsoc_desc:0 "Socialism operating alongside a system of free democracy shall be the great political ideal that drives us forward!"
STE_assert_our_independence:0 "Assert our Independence"

STE_seek_foreign_investment:0 "Seek Foreign Investment"
STE_seek_foreign_investment_desc:0 "Our nation and its prosperity is like a donkey dragging a cart, if the donkey has no carrots to eat it cannot go forward, likewise if our country can't get interest from individuals abroad."
STE_ultimatum_to_orenburg:0 "Ultimatum to Orenburg"
STE_ultimatum_to_orenburg_desc:0 "The generals of Orenburg will always threaten us and our interests… It's time for them to drink their own medicine..."
STE_push_borders_to_maximum:0 "Push our Borders to the Maximum"
STE_push_borders_to_maximum_desc:0 "The borders of this territory shall be pushed to their limits: the more land there is, the more Ukranians will immigrate, turning our land into a land to be feared and respected by the Russian tyrants!"
STE_education_in_ukrainian:0 "Universal Education in Ukrainian"
STE_education_in_ukrainian_desc:0 "A basic education for everyone is the cornerstone of any good socialist agenda. But as we are acting in the interest of the Ukrainian people the education itself should be done in their tongue."
STE_invite_ukrainian_intellectuals:0 "Invite Ukrainian Intellectuals"
STE_invite_ukrainian_intellectuals_desc:0 "Ukranian scientists, engineers and experts in various fields will help in modernization and bringing this frozen husk of a nation to the 20th century."

STE_an_ukrainian_republic:0 "A Ukrainian Republic"
STE_an_ukrainian_republic_desc:0 "We have done enough up till this moment, and now the first step towards a new future for the Ukranian people can finally be taken…"

STE_alash_orda_elected:0 "Alash-dominated Council elected"
STE_alash_orda_elected_desc:0 "We are the “Alash Orda”, or “Kazakh Horde”. For centuries, our people have been looked down upon by the Russian oligarchs and monarchy as nothing but savages. But now that we have taken back our land from the curled fingers of Russian imperialism, we shall set out to create a society which is independent, free, and fair for all native Kazakhs."
STE_liberalize_market_a_bit:0 "Liberalize the Market a bit"
STE_liberalize_market_a_bit_desc:0 "Although the Alash Party does see the need for state-owned public industry, we also see the need for limited private ownership in order to stimulate our capitalist market."
STE_impose_safety_regulations:0 "Impose Safety Regulations"
STE_impose_safety_regulations_desc:0 "Though we understand that maximizing profit is important to our private businesses, but some businessmen are willing to do… rather unsavory… things in order to make as much as they can. We should disallow the more abhorrent of these practices so as to ensure that our Capitalism is moral and equitable."
STE_right_to_strike:0 "The Right to Strike"
STE_right_to_strike_desc:0 "Worker strikes are a vital part of the worker's rights movement, and ensure that capitalism does not go unchecked. We should guarantee our people's right to strike, meaning that firing those who go on strike will become illegal."
STE_institutionalize_alash_party:0 "Institutionalize the Alash Party"
STE_institutionalize_alash_party_desc:0 "The Alash Party is the party of independence and democracy in Kazakhstan.  We have built something from nothing, an independent Republic from a barren Russian warlord state. It is only natural that we should control the government, at least until significant opposition parties arise. We may be a democracy, but for now the Alash party rules Kazakhstan unopposed."
STE_adress_political_issues:0 "Address the Political Issues"
STE_adress_political_issues_desc:0 "Our people have strong political opinions formed under the ignorant Russian Governorate, who willingly ignored their issues in favor of maximizing the efficiency of Russian exploitation. With our new democratic state installed, we can finally address the burning issues of the public."
STE_adress_social_issues:0 "Address the Social Issues"
STE_adress_social_issues_desc:0 "Our people are affected by tribalism, colonialist culture, and prevalence of racist structures despite the new government. In order to complete democratization, we must directly target the issues affecting the people themselves."
STE_welfare_state:0 "Welfare State"
STE_welfare_state_desc:0 "The people must not only be free, but cared for by the State so that they may realize their full potential, regardless of class or ethnicity. We must legislate a major series of welfare reforms in order to realize this dream."
STE_proclaim_republics_independence:0 "Proclaim New Republic's Independence"
STE_proclaim_republics_independence_desc:0 "For ages we have suffered under Russian rule, and long have we wished to be free, but only now can we truly throw off the Russian yoke of oppression. Alash Republic is now independent!"
STE_matter_of_orenburg:0 "Matter of Orenburg"
STE_matter_of_orenburg_desc:0 "A cabal of Dutov's colleagues controls a vast swathe of Kazakh land, leaving many of our people under despotic rule. Shall we crusade against the Russian menace and save our people, but risk the ire of the Tsarists, or leave them in darkness, and forever witness our shame as our people are systematically oppressed."
STE_matter_of_turkestan:0 "Matter of Turkestan"
STE_matter_of_turkestan_desc:0 "The people of Turkestan are currently under Russian occupation to the south of our border. Now that they are cut off, we can spread of Light of independence towards the Turkestan people!"

STE_caspian_expedition_desc:0 "If we are to claim the entirety of the Kazakh lands, we must reach the Caspian Sea. Onwards, against Russia, against Communism, and for Independence!"
STE_army_of_new_republic:0 "Army of the New Republic"
STE_army_of_new_republic_desc:0 "If we are to defend our nation and its borders from reclamation by the White Army, we must establish the Kazakh Army. May brave Kazakhs volunteer to defend their country en masse."
STE_assimilate_old_officers:0 "Assimilate the Old Officer Corps"
STE_assimilate_old_officers_desc:0 "The old Officer Corps may be comprised of Russian generals, but their expertise cannot be denied. If they agree to work for our government, we will gain a significant advantage in our clash with the Russians."
STE_military_research:0 "Military Research"
STE_military_research_desc:0 "If we are to survive in the world of modern warfare, our military technology needs to match or exceed that of our enemies. We must invest in Military R&D."
STE_modern_horde:0 "A Modern Horde"
STE_modern_horde_desc:0 "We may be a horde, but we are far from uncivilized. We have built hospitals, schools, and prosperity here in the steppes. We are a horde as envisioned through the lens of the 19th century."
STE_universal_multilingual_education:0 "Free Universal Multilingual Education"
STE_universal_multilingual_education_desc:0 "Despite believing our people to be savages, one thing the Russians never did was educate our people. Let us remedy this issue by providing every citizen of Kazakhstan with a full, free education."
STE_western_style_secularism:0 "Western-style Secularism"
STE_western_style_secularism_desc:0 "In Western Democratic Republics, religion has no place in the realm of politics. We should seek to emulate this policy while allowing our people to worship as they wish."
STE_pacify_cossacks_and_nomads:0 "Pacify the Nomads and the Cossacks"
STE_pacify_cossacks_and_nomads_desc:0 "Like us, the Nomads and Cossacks have been victims of Russian imperialism for centuries. Let us give them special concessions to show solidarity with them in our independence."
STE_kirgiz_republic:0 "A Kirghiz Republic"
STE_kirgiz_republic_desc:0 "After all we have done, we can truly call ourselves a True Kirghiz Republic. We control all of our lands, and our people live in prosperity. Long Live the Republic!"

STE_the_nomads_have_won:0 "The Nomads have won"
STE_the_nomads_have_won_desc:0 "The war is over. The Kazakh nomads of the steppe have historically been subjugated and forced off their mounts, but today we stand triumphant. As we march into the old capitol, we can see just how much has been wasted on the false dream of civilization, on pointless concrete works stabbed into the beautiful landscape. Their era is over. The nomads ride on."
STE_disregard_infrastructure:0 "Disregard Infrastructure"
STE_disregard_infrastructure_desc:0 "The nomadic life is simple; it needs no braces. Our creaking irrigation canals and needless concrete roadways may make life easier for the average farmhand, but a talented man on his steed needs neither. The energy we would invest into fixing these structures would be better spent almost anywhere else."
STE_peasants_are_not_important:0 "Peasants are not important"
STE_peasants_are_not_important_desc:0 "Peasants are merely a means to an end, at best only useful to provide those occasional trinkets us nomads find useful. If we continue to give them concessions, we will soon become as stifled as our fathers. If we prepare well and grow strong, We can leave them in the dust, and prosper without them."
STE_make_room_for_horses:0 "Make Room for Horses"
STE_make_room_for_horses_desc:0 "Massive tracts of The Steppes are currently farmland, toiled by peasantry. Sustained by expensive irrigation and wasteful canals, these farms have stopped our tribesmen from riding the great steppe, as they must. For our horses to ride truly free, room must be made."
STE_decentralize_arms_production:0 "Decentralize Arms Production"
STE_decentralize_arms_production_desc:0 "In a perfect world, we could leave the cities behind forever. Sadly, arms are one of those few things us nomads cannot make for ourselves. Even still, the factories that we must have can still be spread to protect them from attack and avoid the kind of urban acclimation of power that robbed us of our strength in the past."
STE_blood_tax:0 "The Blood Tax"
STE_blood_tax_desc:0 "In the years following the Russian invasion, many Kazakh have fallen to the lure of toil and plow. Many remain so enslaved to their fields that they would rather see their homeland destroyed than mount a horse and ride. Our solution is simple. The farmers won't enjoy seeing their kids sent off to protect their homeland, but they'll know the alternative. Our ancestors have destroyed cities, empires; what's one more farm?"
STE_learn_from_ottomans:0 "Learn from Ottomans"
STE_learn_from_ottomans_desc:0 "The Ottomans knew how to manage a vast empire, and keep their hand on the wheel until their dying days. They survived and succeeded for half a millennium -- most of the khanates last for far less. If we wish to keep our grip on the nation, we may need to learn some things from them."
STE_black_kirgiz_cavalry:0 "Black Kirghiz Cavalry"
STE_black_kirgiz_cavalry_desc:0 "We need more than some mob on horses. We need a unit with speed, vigor, and the tenacity to do what an average man either can not or will not. At the fringes of the empire, the Kirghiz have been faithful to nomadic life for generations. If properly trained, if perfectly done, a kirghiz division will teach those Franks what it means to be fast."
STE_our_ambitions:0 "Our Ambitions"
STE_our_ambitions_desc:0 "We have carved out a small space where the nomadic lifestyle can be truly respected, but our people know we can grow far greater. Some of our eldest can even remember the days when nomads rode free from the Caspian to Lake Balkhash, and even through to Mongolia. If we can retake the Zhuz and unite the steppe, the clans can ride free once more."
STE_conquest_of_kishi_zhuz:0 "Reconquer the Kishi Zhuz"
STE_conquest_of_kishi_zhuz_desc:0 "The Kishi Zhuz was the first of the Zhuz to fall, and it is now held by those Orenburg curs. Retaking it will bring us close to the dream of a united Khanate, as well as pushing more of the russian leaders off of the steppe."
STE_finish_the_red_threat:0 "Finish the Red Threat"
STE_finish_the_red_threat_desc:0 "The Kazakh Red Army is a pitiful backwater, barely worth remembering. Even the Alash Orda can agree that it's better off in the annals of history, but perhaps they would be less willing to use our methods to make sure of it."
STE_challenge_mongols:0 "Challenge the Mongols"
STE_challenge_mongols_desc:0 "We have grown a powerful, unified empire, and the Mongols know it. They can feel the truth -- that we have grown this power without them. From this new position, it is clear that we can take them on, and that we must. For too long, the Mongols have imagined themselves as lords of the steppe. They have not known how it feels to be conquered. This will change."
STE_restore_uly_zhuz:0 "Restore the Uly Zhuz"
STE_restore_uly_zhuz_desc:0 "The Uly Zhuz was the last of the Zhuz to fall, and holds a prestige that may be crucial for our people, especially our elders. Restoring it will bring glory to the new Khan."
STE_force_invaders_out:0 "Force Invaders out of Orta Zhuz"
STE_force_invaders_out_desc:0 "The Orta Zhuz has been overtaken by Russian settlers uninterested in the nomadic lifestyle, invaders with no respect for our people or our traditions. They must be repulsed for our nation to become truly great."
STE_disarm_sedentary_peoples:0 "Disarm Sedentary Peoples"
STE_disarm_sedentary_peoples_desc:0 "Even as the Khanate soars ever higher, there may still be need for us to protect ourselves from the masses that do not understand our ways. Peasants with guns have changed history. We will not let them change ours."
STE_glory_to_new_khan:0 "Glory to the New Khan"
STE_glory_to_new_khan_desc:0 "It has not been since the days of Tauke Khan that one Khanate has held as much power as ours. That power is felt by every man and woman in the empire, from the peasants who bow as the Khan passes to the lower clan leaders who hang on to his every word. He is a hero, a victor, a return to a greatness most thought was lost forever. Glory to the New Khan! "
STE_violent_purge:0 "Violent Purge"
STE_violent_purge_desc:0 "Many of the more politically minded are a dangerous threat to our nomadic society, clinging to futile dreams of factions that we have rode past. Perhaps they are better left dead."
STE_force_russians_to_bow:0 "Force Russians to Bow"
STE_force_russians_to_bow_desc:0 "The Russians that have colonized our lands now number too vast to be completely purged or deported. If they cannot leave our lands, they can at least learn an important lesson: The nomads are supreme."
STE_away_with_alash:0 "Away with Alash Dreamers"
STE_away_with_alash_desc:0 "The Alash revolutionaries dream of a society of sedentary and secular peoples, of a society melded by western thought antithetical to the ways of our new order. With some key arrests and crackdowns, perhaps we can wake them."
STE_steppe_bows_to_noone:0 "The Steppe bows to no one!"
STE_steppe_bows_to_noone_desc:0 "History has shown us many fools who thought they could tame the Steppe, make it play their game and live by their rules. The Russians thought they finally succeeded, but their hold is lost forever. The Khan has shown it: the Steppe bows to no one!"

STE_cossack_uprising:0 "The Cossack Uprising"
STE_cossack_uprising_desc:0 "The cards are set, the pawns have been placed, and the deck is full. It is only a matter of when the clock hits 12."

STE_subjugate_non_cossacks:0 "Subjugate the non-Cossacks"
STE_subjugate_non_cossacks_desc:0 "For millennia the Poles, Muscovites, and Catholics have held our heads under like we were dogs, we will show them who the true dogs are. Qazaq belong in our lands, not inozemtsi."
STE_plunder_econoomy:0 "The Plunder Economy"
STE_plunder_econoomy_desc:0 "The Earth and all it's civilized peoples are nothing more than fruits that haven't been harvested. This is true for all things."

STE_no_matter_the_language_desc:0 "What does God care of dialects and mere words?"
STE_no_matter_your_wealth:0 "No Matter your Wealth"
STE_no_matter_your_wealth_desc:0 "If you can watch the life drain out of a man, of what importance is the fancy engravings and jewels on your sword?"
STE_bandit_state:0 "Bandit State"
STE_bandit_state_desc:0 "Eradication, forced participation, humiliation. Nowhere from Berlin to Beijing will be safe. We will conquer every city, burn every wall, salt every field, defile every woman and girl, take all artifacts, sacred or not. We will unleash every sin upon the world like the hounds of hell."

STE_operations_takeover:0 "Operations' Takeover"
STE_operations_takeover_desc:0 "The soldiers and the petty officers, no longer constrained by personalities like Kolchak, have taken over the General Governatore. Russian hegemony is expected to be reestablished under their administration, with radicals, Mongoloid nationalists, and nomad-bandits expected targets of persecution under this “officers' rule”. Closer ties as well as potentially a focus on reintegration with the Petrograd regime will be the nucleus of this government's foreign policy."
STE_remove_kornilov:0 "Remove Kornilov"
STE_remove_kornilov_desc:0 "He was an honorable man, a war hero, a darling of the upper classes - but he was too weak. Too compassionate. We can't arrest him, but we can arrest his cronies, and while we shall continue his cult of personality, we will offer the man himself a cozy villa somewhere in Italy for  him to spend there the remainder of his life in retirement and as far away from Akmolinsk as possible."
STE_purge_bureaucracy:0 "Purge Bureaucracy"
STE_purge_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The leeches gnawing at the roots of our Governorate, these Russophone but questionably Russian pencil-pushers, this cancer that prevents us from enacting even basic reforms - we will not be merciful to Russia's greatest enemy, the Bureaucrats."
STE_subsidizze_agrarian_sector:0 "Subsidize the Agrarian Sector"
STE_subsidizze_agrarian_sector_desc:0 "The agricultural sector is one of the primary pillars of the Governatore's economy. Under new programs, farmers growing cotton will benefit from funds and advisors focused on solving the complex issues surrounding irrigation. The investments will eventually pay off, and the Governatore will make a hefty profit off of exporting high quality cotton to manufacturers in Russia and the West. Farmers growing other crops like wheat and rice will be assisted as well, lest their crops fail and the Governatore collapses from famine."
STE_prioritize_russian_farmers:0 "Prioritize the Russian Farmers"
STE_prioritize_russian_farmers_desc:0 "Russian families have farmed the fields of the steppes ever since the Empire crushed the backwards khanates who filled up much of their territory, and as part of one greater Russian national family, we must prioritize them over Moslem farmers. They are believers in the correct Orthodox faith, speak the tongue of the soldiers and officers who rule over them, and would be loyal enough to fight for us if elements hostile to Russia attempt anything against our rule. It would be a hassle to try to accommodate the numerously more Moslem families, since their knowledge and skill is surely lower than those of our fine Russian farmers."
STE_purge_military:0 "Purge the Military"
STE_purge_military_desc:0 "Kornilov still has many friends and pals in the officers corps, and we will be swiftly purging them to contain their potential acts against us, fueled by their devotion to this Asiatic idiot. Loyal men will pound their doors at the middle of the night, and since there's not much information to extract from them anyways, we'll keep them around for a bit, giving them a nice little slap to the face to show them who's boss now. Sooner or later, however, we will have to set up some courts to dish out some justice. The whole process shouldn't take more than a week to completely execute."
STE_kickstart_conscription:0 "Kickstart Conscription"
STE_kickstart_conscription_desc:0 "Many young men, whether they be patriotic Russians or deceitful Mongoloids, wander about the cities and the streets with emptiness in their lives and misery in their souls. Oh, what to do, what to do with these youngsters..."
STE_drill:0 "Drill the Hell out of them!"
STE_drill_desc:0 "15 laps in the morning after breakfast! 50 laps 15 minutes after supper! 300 pushups for the bastard who didn't scream back during the morning roll call! Harsh emphasis on exercises will forge the soldiers of our Governatorate from little yawning boys into defenders of the soil, ready to defend from any outside forces. Broader exercises will be also explored to instill readiness for larger scale operations among the ranks."
STE_martial_meritocracy:0 "Martial Meritocracy"
STE_martial_meritocracy_desc:0 "Those who can defend this integral region of Russia will be elevated. We are creating a new meritocracy of sorts, a superior brotherhood of martial aristocrats, who shall rule in this wild part of Russia like Boers in Africa or Gauchos in Argentina."
STE_review_economy:0 "Review the Economy"
STE_review_economy_desc:0 "Matters of the economy are something that unfortunately has to be reviewed once more. It seems that the previous administration was just that incompetent - though much of it has its roots in Kornilov's compassion towards those lazy Kirghiz bumpkins."
STE_tougher_punishments:0 "Tougher Punishments for Strikers"
STE_tougher_punishments_desc:0 "These workers who spew Bolshevik filth are annoying enough on their own,  but when they grind entire shops and factories to a halt, they evolve from an annoyance to a danger to the functioning of the General Governatorate. Kornilov must've been too scared to get tough on strikers- a sign of his own weakness, which is one of the reasons we've removed him in the first place. Sentencing for strikes will be tougher to prevent these red scoundrels from infecting honest workers with their lies."
STE_invite_investors:0 "Invite Foreign Investors"
STE_invite_investors_desc:0 "We need to advertise our land, our Wild West of the Russian Empire, to various entrepreneurs and investors from abroad. Finnish, Baltic-German, Swedish-Norwegian, Dutch and even English industrialists would be welcome, since our Governorate provides both huge plots of land and a lot of cheap Asiatic workforce."
STE_industrialize_dominion:0 "Industrialize our Dominion"
STE_industrialize_dominion_desc:0 "The wide, flat terrain of Central Asia would be excellent building space for industry. We should call on the Petrograd government to send experts, funds and others forms of aid to begin the process of industrialization. Industrialization will create many jobs for Russians and Moslems alike, boosting the local economy as well as benefiting the empire as a whole. Already, many of our own leaders have taken an interest in defence oriented industry for the Governatorate; if this is the path we shall take, in five years tanks, bullets and mortars headed for the hands of the men who have been put forth to defend Russia itself will be marked with the proud signature of the commanders of the governorate!"
STE_question_democratization:0 "Question of Democratization"
STE_question_democratization_desc:0 "Many of our officers are opposed to a democratic system or reforms leaning in favor of such an ideology, but it seems to be popular amongst the little cliques of Russian intellectuals otherwise  loyal to our rule. They argue that we could pacify some of the anger and grievances of the churkas by giving them the illusion of self representation in an official legislative duma. Of course, we wouldn't let them get anything done, but it could be a way to prevent Bolsheviks or Koranic fanatics from sinking their poisonous, anti-Russian influence into the native masses. However, continuing the methods of absolute rule still has its benefits; but ripping out rebellious tendencies will be the priority either way."
STE_censorship_laws:0 "Strict Censorship Laws"
STE_censorship_laws_desc:0 "Degenerate literature; anti-Russian political screechings; even some independent newspapers in the cities who do not openly criticize us but smirkfully poke fun at our mistakes cannot be allowed to exist. Under new censorship laws these annoyances to the prosperity and functioning of our Governatore will be weeded out. These new laws will not only sanction current violators but set in penalties that will make any spreader of vice think twice before they do something that could harm their prospects for a free and warm life, away from the freezing misery of exile in Siberia."
STE_uphold_russian_identity:0 "Uphold the All-Russian Identity"
STE_uphold_russian_identity_desc:0 "The policy of Great Russia, Little Russia, and White Russia as part of an all-Russian identity has yet to completely fail us as a people, and if we defend this greater identity here, our rule will be stabilized. This is a key part of who we are. Russian children growing up away from the glory of the Rodina will receive an education that informs them of the greatness of the empire they are growing up in, and their hearts will be swelled with pride for their identity and their motherland. When the trumpet of war calls the nation to take back Little and White Russia from false nationalists, they will answer the call with fervority and patriotism."
STE_no_room_for_natives:0 "No Room for Natives"
STE_no_room_for_natives_desc:0 "By this point we have established that Russians will be prioritized as a people and as a group in the Governatore. It is only logical that lesser attention will be made to improve the lives of the Kazakhs and the rootless nomads. We will establish laws clearly separating their lower societies from theirs; no Mongoloid child is deserving of an education which could be given to a Russian child, no Mongoloid men shall be marrying or reproducing Russian women, and Mongoloid slums in the cities will be separated from Russian communities, among others. This is a land that will be built up for the Russians!"
STE_military_industrial_complex_of_steppes:0 "Military-Industrial Complex of the Steppes"
STE_military_industrial_complex_of_steppes_desc:0 "It shall be not just open plains and occasional villages that would define the Steppe's image - in the cities and small towns alike, there will be factories after factories producing guns, tanks, planes and other modern weapons, for Russia's greater glory of course."
STE_steppe_in_russias_image:0 "A Steppe in Russia's Image"
STE_steppe_in_russias_image_desc:0 "Russia is our homeland, our model. We will rebuild the Steppes to reflect its image, whether some like it or not. The economy, mostly built upon agriculture and mining to a lesser degree, could use a census of sorts to determine where inefficiency lies. When we start crunching the numbers, we'll see what's wrong. And the boys are due for a break; interviewing farmers and poking around with their equipment will be a godsend compared to the hours of drilling and other exhausting activities they do daily. S nami Bog!"
STE_look_outside_for_ambitions:0 "Look outside to check if we have ambitions"
STE_look_outside_for_ambitions_desc:0 "It is undeniable that while the world outside of us burned, we did not merely endure the calamity - we conducted such reforms that Stolypin himself would have wept in joy, witnessing our mighty Steppe - a wilderness tamed, an iconic landscape welcoming tens of thousands of Russian settlers every year. But perhaps an age of internal reformism is over, and it is time to dream about something greater, about a way to export our way of governance to the rest of Russia."

STE_army_effort:0 "Army Effort"
STE_army_effort_desc:0 "Despite the increasing possibilities of aerial and naval warfare, ground combat is still key in tomorrow's wars. With preparation, we can avoid reliving the hell of the trenches."
STE_equipment_effort:0 "Equipment Effort"

STE_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "The battlefield has changed not just in the interbellum years, but over the course of recent conflicts. We must continuously reevaluate our doctrines to reflect this."

STE_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "Instead of imitating or buying foreign equipment, we should aim to become world-leading in infantry weapons."
STE_armor_effort:0 "Armor Effort"
STE_armor_effort_desc:0 "Applying what we have learned from mechanizing our infantry, we can improve our armored vehicles as well."
STE_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"

STE_aviation_effort:0 "Aviation Effort"
STE_aviation_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YAir Base§!"
STE_aviation_effort_desc:0 "Nowhere is technological advances more rapid than in aerial warfare. Aviation is a field any modern nation must master."
STE_fighter_focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
STE_fighter_focus_desc:0 "We have not seen that last of dogfights in the Great War. Keeping ahead in the development of fighter planes will give us an edge in the future."
STE_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
STE_bomber_focus_desc:0 "When people of the future speak of the horror to today's wars, fire raining from the skies will prominently feature. We will do our best to ensure those stories are told by our enemies."
STE_aviation_effort_2:0 "Aviation Effort II"
STE_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Further advances in aviation will be necessary to integrate our air force well with other branches of the military."
STE_CAS_effort:0 "CAS Effort"
STE_CAS_effort_desc:0 "A modern army needs support from vehicles not only on the ground, but also in the air."
STE_rocket_effort:0 "Rocket Effort"
STE_rocket_effort_desc:0 "Rocket and jet engines allow for unprecedented speeds for unmanned and manned vessels alike. Pioneering these technologies will allow us to take the enemy by surprise."
STE_NAV_effort:0 "NAV Effort"
STE_NAV_effort_desc:0 "Just as the new naval warfare takes place in part beneath the water's surface, part of it takes place in the air above the waters."
STE_naval_effort:0 "Naval Effort"
STE_naval_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YNaval Dockyards§!"
STE_naval_effort_desc:0 "The expansion of our navy should be our first priority. Assign all available resources to new Dockyards and research into light surface ships."
STE_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Navy"
STE_flexible_navy_desc:0 "Reinventing naval warfare to account for the advances in submarine technology will allow us to strike efficiently against enemy convoys."
STE_large_navy:0 "Large Navy"
STE_large_navy_desc:0 "Adapting our naval doctrines to accommodate large ships and ensuring the safety of our trade convoys will teach us much about what sort of ships we need."
STE_submarine_effort:0 "Submarine Effort"
STE_submarine_effort_desc:0 "Submarine warfare is the most exciting naval development since the invention of the torpedo boat. We would do well to not just protect against submarines, but also use them against enemy shipping."
STE_cruiser_effort:0 "Cruiser Effort"
STE_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Before making forays into advanced battleship research, the smaller cruisers are in need of replacement."
STE_destroyer_effort:0 "Destroyer Effort"
STE_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "Studying the design and strategic use of submarines, we have also learned how to counter those strategies. Destroyers will be crucial for this."
STE_capital_ships_effort:0 "Capital Ship Effort"
STE_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "The nation with the most battleships will rule the oceans. Battleships and carriers represent the old and the new in naval superiority."
STE_industrial_effort:0 "Industrial Effort"
STE_industrial_effort_desc:0 "Focus all our political efforts on building up the civilian industry in a great leap forward."
STE_industrial_effort_2:0 "Industrial Effort II"

STE_production_effort_2:0 "Armament Effort II"
STE_production_effort_2_desc:0 "Trying to adapt civilian factories to produce military equipment is inefficient. We should focus on preparing military production now."
STE_production_effort_3:0 "Armament Effort III"
