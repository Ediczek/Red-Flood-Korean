### IDEAS
MRS_brave_army:0 "용맹한 우리 군"
MRS_brave_army_desc:0 "Although our small island kingdom consists only of the Moroc-Songhrati Archipelago, ever since our foundation, our brave military forces have been fighting constant battles against pirates, raiders and other seaborne scoundrels. Our soldiers always stand above the rest of the world due to their patriotic spirit, quality equipment and training, and are unfailing in their defence of the Nation!"
MRS_dependent_economy:0 "심히 의존하는 경제"
MRS_dependent_economy_desc:0 "To tell the truth, our small kingdom - composed only of some islets and coral reefs - is not exactly well equipped for industry. By leaning heavily on our Japanese benefactors' aid, we have begun industrialising our capital city of Southwark, and hopefully will soon have our economy standing on its own two feet. Until then, however, our dependence on Tokyo is plain for all to see."
MRS_unrecognized:0 "승인 부족"
MRS_unrecognized_desc:0 "After the coup against the Meads Dynasty in 1919, the loyalists of King Andrew I were able to expand our great kingdom to hundreds of islets - however, the wider world cares not for our kingdom or status as an independent nation, with the only nations that do being in the Japanese sphere."

### MISC
POLITICS_FISHER_DESC:0 "His Royal Majesty, Andrew I of the Fisher Dynasty, was born in Australia and immigrated to the Kingdom of Moroc-Songhrati in the 1910s - with his intellectual background and great ideas for the expansion of our Kingdom as a sovereign entity, he quickly earned the trust of the former, tyrannical, Meads Dynasty. First appointed as the Minister of Education, and later as the Vicechancellor of the Kingdom, he managed to establish the first, and currently the only, university in our nation, and greatly improved the quality of life of the natives. However, conflicts arised as the Meads Dynasty tried to structure the Kingdom as a \"tourist attraction\", rather than a proper sovereign country. Andrew, along with the Japanese, managed to successfully coup and exile king Franklin I, and the nation became a Japanese protectorate. The King now seeks to expand the country even further, so it may control thousands of islets, and more!"
