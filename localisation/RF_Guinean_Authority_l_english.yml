#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_THIERNO_BAH_DESC:0 "Thierno Abdourahmane Bah is considered one of the most widely respected clerics of the Fula tribe, despite his young age. Descended from ancient African Islamic aristocracy, Thierno spends most of his time in mosques and in his humble home studying the Quran and all the intricacies of Islam, deeply influenced by his people's indigenous beliefs and Sufism, despite being nominally Sunni in perspective. Thierno is considered the \"Protector of indigenous Islam in Africa\", deeply beloved by his subjects as a tolerant but firm leader, who is massively popular for his traditionally-minded beliefs and tradiitonally-minded economics. Deeply suspicious of the outside world, Thierno advocates for a simple, humble life, and for universal decency and otherwise protection of the weak whilst securing Islam's power in Africa."
#IDEAS#
GUN_protector_of_islam:0 "Proclaimed Protector of Islam in Africa"
GUN_protector_of_islam_desc:0 "Despite the cries of secularists, Christians, and colonizers, Guinea stands as a profound protector of Islam. Arabic is used in schools, mystic belief in Allah's teachings and several other axioms of our society continue to prove Guinea's unbreakable belief in Islam."
GUN_no_infrastructure:0 "Terrible Infrastructure"
GUN_no_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our independence did not come cheap. Our deeply mountainous and forested lands are nearly impassable, and means that our territory is incredibly hard to govern outside the Fula Highlands and Conakry."
