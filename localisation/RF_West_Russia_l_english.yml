#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
WRU_DESC_MENU:0 "발트 총독부는 독일 제국에 맞서 싸우기 위해 더 나은 조직을 갖추고자 1916년 회복되었습니다. 많은 발트 인민이 대전쟁 자원에 따른 평등권과 처우를 요구하고, 역내 러시아인 노동자들 역시 고통받으면서 공산주의자들은 상당한 지지세를 얻게 되었습니다. 이 요구들은 역내 분쟁으로 이어지며 1921년까지 지속될 내전의 시작이 되었습니다. 하지만 이 모든 반대는 파벨 베르몬트-아발로프의 지휘 아래 빠르게 진압됐습니다. 정권에 금이 갔음은 1935년 노동파업의 결과 드러났으니, 이제 무엇이 기다리는진 시간만이 말해줄 것입니다."

wru.1.desc:0 "A dense mist slept upon the dark port of Yur'yev, and the crash of the waves was all that disturbed the early morning silence. Ever since the end of the Great War, the docks saw significantly less traffic with merchants prefering to bring their goods through the much cheaper ports in Prussia or straight to Petrograd. It made the job of the local customs department significantly easy, but it also made the dock prime target. A note, unsigned, printed in broken Russian, was found attached to a suspiciously unlabeled crate, and it read:\n\n\"노동자들의 혁명이 금방이다. 썩어빠진 너희의 구조 전부가 무너지길 기다려라!\""

wru.2.desc:0 "The west moving colonists did not have the appearance of people fleeing poverty or oppression. They arrived in cars and trucks, large convoys of them. Loaded down with well made and pricey possessions, the vehicles each pulled into large manors overlooking the fields and farms. Landlords. Foreign landlords, coming on behalf of the Russian government. They were healthy, jovial people, eyes glittering, dressed in fine clothing and carrying the like of gold pocket watches. They smoked better tobacco, and drank the finest alcohols, imports from Britain.\nNew lives in new lands, plenty of opportunities for profit, and the total blessing of their own government to do it. It was no surprise, really that so many wealthy Russians headed west. Bit by bit, little by little, these laughing, good looking people owned all the farmland anyone could see. As the cars and trucks moved past, children pointed out of the windows of these fashionable vehicles at the beautiful landscapes and rolling fields, and even more at the poor and dispossessed locals that could be found labouring on both sides of the roads. Hunched, tired figures, overcast like the skies overhead.\nThe children of these families didn't notice the sullen glares boring through the windows of their cars, but the adults must have been able to, if they bothered to look."

wru.3.desc:0 "Nikolai couldn't get to sleep. Swaddled in the cocoon of his sheets, he sweat horribly. The night was cool, a gentle breeze blew in through the open window, and yet, the weight of his sheets felt stifling. He hid in them, nevertheless. The footsteps were back. They paced beneath his window, subtle, but all too real. Nikolai clenched his eyes shut. The third night in a row, the unseen visitor stalked back and forth through the garden, each footfall heavy and hateful.\nWorse, Nikolai's father refused to believe him. Ivan Mikhailovich Seremov had rolled his eyes, dismissing his child's fears as nerves in a new and alien country. Nikolai knew better. He knew those feet outside his window were not an animal's, or the product of his imagination. Outside, someone coughed. Nikolai hoped his father heard it.\n But nothing happened.\nAcross the room, Tatyana's soft breathing was the only other sound in the room.\nNikolai considered getting out of bed and calling father again. He froze as the front door opened. The creaking hinges, so familiar by day, were alien and hostile by night, foreboding and menacing. They groaned, long, loud. Someone heard this. Finally, someone knew he wasn't lying. The maid was up. He heard her, next door, muttering something to herself. Her feet were not sure in the dark as she blearily found her way to her door and opened it. Nikolai held his breath as the plump woman padded down the stairs.\nHe nearly choked in fear as she screamed. It was a drawn out, blood curdling thing, filled with terror and pain. It wavered and warbled between the wet sounds of impact. With a sickening thud, the maid's voice died in her throat. Tatyana was awake now, already sobbing quietly. There was a brief pause before a pair of boots began to thump towards the stairs. Nikolai was almost frozen in fear, but forced himself out of bed as he heard his father's door slam open. Just two days ago, Ivan had told him to be a man.\nHe opened his door as his father came storming down the hall, his old officer's sabre clenched in one fist. Ivan's tired blue eyes locked onto Nikolai's own.\n“Go back to your room,” he said, storming past, “Protect your sister.”\nNikolai retreated. Tatyana was sitting bolt upright in bed, tears shining against the blue-white half light of the moon outside.\nIvan yelled something at the unseen force advancing up the stairs. Then, he too began to scream. This wasn't piercing, and though it was agonized, it wasn't nearly as frightened as the maids' had been. A man snarled, voice hate filled and wordless. Nikolai heard another pair of feet rush from his parents' bedroom and towards his."

wru.4.desc:0 "The man's feet shot up the stairs and pounded quicker than Nikolai could believe across the long hall. No screams now, only a thud, and the sound of something wet and fleshy, like the sound meat makes in a butcher's shop. Nikolai squeezed his eyes shut, shielding his trembling sister behind him, facing the door, hoping against hope that the presence on the other side was not the unknown visitor. That somehow, his father had won the fight in the end.\nThe handle turned.\nNikolai opened his eyes, forcing himself to witness whatever it was that stood before him. It was all he could do not to tremble. He was rooted to the spot. The man was dressed in black, face shrouded by a hood. His eyes glinted, cool and hard in the moonlight. At his feet, the ruin of Nikolai's mother, head staved in. Her blood shone, crimson and chunky with flesh.\nTatyana wailed.\nNikolai tried to remain brave for his sister. He tried to be a man, to honour the military heritage of his family.\n“It is important,” Ivan's voice echoed in his head, “For a man to die with dignity.”\nStill, he flinched as the axe came up, shining and wicked, trailing flecks of castoff."

wru.5.desc:0 "Andrus worked a sixteen hour day. He hated it. He hated the sweat pouring into his eyes. He hated the blisters that formed on his hands, painful and hot. He hated when they burst. He hated the endless manual labour, the silent fear that dominated the fields that he and his colleagues worked in. But above all, he hated the German aristocrats that had all but forced him to do this. They didn't need to put guns on him. They controlled the food, the markets, the money, everything. There was no other work, not for an Estonian. Andrus was either a slave in all but name, or he'd starve to death.\nHe glared at the overseer watching them. Far from the stereotypical view of a slavemaster, the Baron was not an angry or cruel looking man. Rather, he was rosy cheeked and jolly. Quick to laughter, the Baron did not seem at all the kind of person that would hopelessly sweat men for nothing. But as the Baron looked back and forth over the workers below him, Andrus knew the truth. The smile on the baron's face went no further than his lips.\nThe man next to him grunted as he fell, legs unable to support him. They were barely paid anything, and they had to pay for room and board on top of it. Andrus knew that he and the rest were slowly dying. He glanced back up at the Baron. Cold eyes locked onto his, shadowed beneath the overcast sky. The Baron glanced at the fallen man next to Andrus. He pointed to the prostrate form, head turning to the guard standing next to him, pristinely uniformed in pipe grey. The soldier, hands folded neatly behind his back, simply nodded.\nThe Baron turned and waddled away.\nThe next day, the man next to Andrus was gone.\nAndrus toiled on. He just wanted one good meal."

wru.6.desc:0 "Matis spoke no more than two words during the entirety of his trial. There wasn't time for more. The trial didn't last any longer than five minutes.\n\n“Not guilty.”\n\nThese words themselves were difficult, bruised and beaten as he was. The Russian soldiers that had worked as stand ins for local police had been downright brutal. Matis was missing two teeth from a rifle butt smashed into his jaw. The Russians had snarled as they did it, stooping over his fallen form. It was a mercy that the initial shock of the blow had made him insensate enough to dull the pain of the flurry of kicks and baton blows that they had delivered against him on the night of his arrest.\nThe jury, there were four of them, glared down at him from where they sat elevated, perpendicular to the judge. Two Russians, two Germans, all aristocrats. Not one of them was a native Balt. The judge glowered down at him. An imposing, stonefaced Russian, he launched into a tirade that the translator standing nervously next to him could barely keep up with.\nMatis was a communist, the judge exclaimed, he absolutely had cause to slaughter an upper class Russian family.  He was a deranged murderer, and still he had the gall to lie. The judge's face seemed to turn red, then purple as he worked himself into a frothing rage at the depravity of Matis's supposed crime. Matis knew that this was a formality. He hadn't seen his comrades in a week. Probably already dead, he reflected.\nIt didn't surprise him when the sentence was passed down.\n“Death.”\nMatis didn't even have the energy to struggle as he was dragged from the room in chains. The scaffold was not far away. As he was led to it, he took a moment to observe the sky. Grey again. Mournful. Would it cry for him today? What he assumed were the extended family of those poor victims stood facing him, glowering in hatred. Matis wanted to tell them he didn't do it, that he and his comrades had gone no further than reading Marx.\nNo point. Even if they cared about whether he was guilty or not...even if they were real, they too were caught up in the frenzy.\nAs the noose was tied around his neck, Matis shook his head at the priest. He needed no blessing, not now. He was already damned.\n“Do you have any last words?” His executioner demanded.\nThe truth, one last time.\n“I never touched the-”\nThe trapdoor opened."

After spending countless hours trying to figure out how to do reprisals to the perpetrators of the horrible murder, realizing that it was not the actions of just nationalist, but an United Front of Latvian-Estonian nationalists, minorities, Communists, and internationalist liberals. Therefore, the organization of Corps Rubonia death squads across the country, be them legally operated or not, is key to maintaining German prowess in the Governorate. At least - that is what Rosenberg believes. While there haven't been clashes between the Corps Rubonia squads and the local police (as they have similar interests), there have been reports of violent reprisals against Latvians and Estonians."

Listen, we need to find some evidence of partisan activity in the area. Do your job.\"\n\nThe police corps had been searching for hours now, their supplies growing thinner and the day disappearing as the night took over. Perhaps it was time to go home and rest? No, they were assigned to find something. We have lanterns, we can deal with the darkness.\n\n \"Maximovich! I found something!\" said someone else, namely Mazhulin. \"What is it?\" said he, arriving to Mazhulin's area, but before he could see what he was, his vision went black, and he fell on the ground, hearing grass touch his face, now covered by some kind of cloth. He began to hear gunfire, and people falling down the ground - screaming in pain, one of them painfully close to him. He felt something knock against his head, and so he fell unconscious."

Baltic aristocrats talked about it being an \"United Front\", as touted by Rosenberg and his Corps Rubonia squads.

And so, arriving at the place where most policemen disappeared, it seems that there was a complicated system of traps all across the whole of the Baltics, set up by nationalists who have been fighting off Russification. Perhaps the strangest thing is the inability to recover them - the Baltics is not a large place - where could they be?

Perhaps, it was high time that they would do something about it - and so they did - beginning a march that would start in Riga and would end in Dvinsk. It appeared that things were going surprisingly well for the Latvian students protesting, yet it seemed that the place was teeming with tension as the local police began to push the protesters away from main squares, forcing them into smaller neighborhoods - cramped and irritated. Subsequently, the \"shot heard around the Baltics\" was fired - where a Russian soldier fired out of panic and fear of the harassing Latvians, who had injured one of his friends. The shot hit nobody, but it set a precedent that things were about to get much bloodier.\n\nLatvian students and impromptu \"militias\" had begun firing against the police, and subsequently the fight between families holding old rifles and using them in the march, and brutal hand-to-hand fighting against one another meant that the peaceful March (although many claim that it was never intended to be peaceful), not quite ending when expected, resulted in almost twenty deaths on all sides."

The response has been one of national outrage at what is a transparent attempt to foster loyalty amongst the youth. The government in Riga has responded with a rather ominous message in their official statement: “We must face the reality that the radicalism abroad and turmoil within our own borders will naturally lead to war. It may not come for some time, but it is inevitable, whether or not it is easy to admit. And when the time comes, our children shall not be left to waste away in the trenches of destroyed towns, as they were in the destruction of the Great War. Instead, they shall defend themselves, and fight proudly for the preservation of peace in our region.” There are many who oppose this line of thought, even within the most militaristic political circles, but with Riga having backing from the Russian Empire, the chance of any pushback being successful is slim to none. Thus, the organization shall begin operations soon, with this historic day being honored as “Foundation Day”.\nIn order to gain perspective, a young man, age fourteen, was interviewed. When asked why he decided to join, the boy responded, “I'm not sure. My parents said this would help make me into a man, so I signed up alongside my friends.”."

Now, if you were to walk the campus of the University of Riga, you could hear drill sergeants barking and the sound of gunfire anywhere you went. Despite student complaints about noise and being unable to study, the Corps have hardened their stance, saying that anyone who doesn't like the sound of German patriotism should simply transfer to Tallinn University.\nIt is yet unclear whether the Russian government endorses the stated mission of the organization, although their amicable interactions would certainly suggest some sort of sympathies. Foreign policy analysts have been quick to point out that the deposed monarchy of Germany actually was related to the Romanovs by way of Queen Victoria, so perhaps Russia is using this tenuous connection to justify arming its political allies against Councilist Germany.

Russo-German battalions moved house-to-house in places as they counterattacked, while several neighborhoods fell quickly to Nationalist control as local Estonian sympathizers attempted their own piecemeal risings.However, as the Estonian advanced stalled out and the Russian artillery firing from the Põhja-Tallinn peninsula in the north of the city - beyond the reach of the partisans - found their range, it became increasingly apparent that the Nationalists had overestimated their ability to face a regular army head-on. The Russian artillery, along with gunboats from the remnants of the local Baltic Fleet squadron on station, leveled entire neighborhoods to break Estonian concentrations and allow the infantry to maneuver and envelope the areas still under Partisan control.Mopping-up operations are ongoing, and while some Estonian groups have managed to exfiltrate from the city, but by nightfall a majority of the survivors had surrendered to the Russian regulars (who are at least in theory subject to some legal restraint) rather than risk the dubious mercy of the monarchist irregulars.

However, despite his vast amount of qualifications, Rosenberg has become well-known for his outlandish racial and religious theories. Rosenberg believes that Baltic-Germans are just one part of the Nordic race, a race which should go on to rule the world due to their superiority. Rosenberg also claims that among the Nordic groups, Germans were of the purest blood, although the Balts who occupy much of the Duchy's landmass were given a position not too far beneath.\nThe other frontrunner is Erhard Kroeger, who promises a broad yet thoroughly Anti-Councilist policy agenda. Kroeger took the rise of the partisans as a sign that Councilism had become a significant threat in the Baltics, however, he does not apply the same logic to the Nationalists, who he says he would be more than happy to work with in ridding the Duchy of Councilism.\nOne interesting aspect of this race is the relationship between Kroeger and Rosenberg, as Rosenberg is somewhat of a political protege to Kroeger. Rosenberg is running against his former ally because he feels that Kroeger has betrayed his own doctrine by focusing entirely on Anti-Councilism rather than building a strong German-Batlic society. That being said, should Kroeger assume the office, it's not unlikely that Kroeger will appoint Rosenberg to a position of political leadership.\nKroeger may not have as much governing experience, but he also lacks Rosenberg's… eccentricities.

A close friend and political ally of Rosenberg, Scheubner-Richter, if elected, is expected to carry out Rosenberg's wishes to the letter.\n\nHowever, despite his opponent being a shoo-in for the position, Rosenberg has decided to run for vice-Chancellor as well. While nothing in our constitution explicitly prohibits Rosenberg from being Chancellor and vice-Chancellor, most see this as a negative outcome. Rosenberg himself, however, has always advocated for centralization, and his words are beginning to find support among the electors.\n\nWho will the electors choose?"

wru.103.desc:0 "Now that Alfred Rosenberg is Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor, the position has been made somewhat moot. However, there is still one vestige of the past, one corner of the government which Rosenberg has yet to seize for himself. The foreign minister. This person will act as the welcoming committee and ambassador to all foreign countries: the veritable face of the Duchy, as far as the rest of the world is concerned. \n\nRosenberg has made it abundantly clear that he intends to claim this position as well, making his power nearly limitless in both domestic and foreign affairs.  While this idea is obviously unsavory to most, more and more voices both in and out of the government have begun calling for strong leadership, not unlike the Kaiserreich of old. \n\nDespite these sentiments, resistance to Rosenberg is strong among both the noble class and the general populace, who have rallied behind Margarete Von Wrangell as their opposition candidate. The Baroness may not have much political experience, but seeing as she is a university professor in a society which is famously suspicious of women in academia, she has more than proven her competence and intelligence. \n\nEveryone has their reasons for supporting one candidate, or the other, or neither of them. What remains to be seen is how the votes will go. Will the Noble opposition levy their disproportionate influence in order to thwart Rosenberg? Or will Rosenberg's political allies strengthen their position in the government, as well as that of their leader?"

This position will act as the welcoming committee and ambassador to all foreign countries: the veritable face of the Duchy, as far as the rest of the world is concerned. \n\nDespite already being Head of State, Alfred Rosenberg has contested the government's nearly unanimous decision to appoint Margarete Von Wrangell as Foreign Minister, instead suggesting that he himself take the position in order to directly control our foreign affairs. Regardless, the chances that the government will give his advice any pause aren't exactly great.\n\nVon Wrangell, on the other hand, is quickly gaining traction among the populace and the government. Her political career leaves some to be desired, but her competence and intelligence cannot be denied, even by the socially reactionary hermit kingdom. Indeed, Margarete will serve as the first female public servant in the Duchy, yet another first for the esteemed Baroness.\n\nIf Rosenberg is to succeed, he would surely use his power to gridlock all of our affairs, both international and domestic. However, electing a woman to the office may set a precedent of social progressivism. We must think carefully, and choose wisely."

This vice-Chancellor will act as head of government, overseeing legislation in the Duchy.\n\nMax Erwin von Scheubner-Richter is the obvious frontrunner, a relatively young, yet experienced political activist who had served during the Great War. However, he is also a close friend and ally of Alfred Rosenberg, and many fear that electing him would mean a government ruled in secret by Rosenberg.\n\nAnd who better to oppose a potential crypto-Rosenbergite than Alfred Rosenberg himself? That's right, in light of his recent failed bid for Chancellor, Rosenberg has decided to shoot for the next best thing. While it seems like an easy choice between the two, some have been quick to point out that it might be better to have Rosenberg in an open position of authority where he can be scrutinized, rather than being able to manipulate events from the shadows.\n\nSo, in the race between Alfred Rosenberg and man who is basically his political equal and also possibly planted by him, who wins?"

wru.106.desc:0 "With Rosenberg now acting a Vice-Chancellor under Erhard Kroeger, the only position in the central government left to fill is the Foreign Minister. This minister governs the foreign affairs of the Duchy independently from the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor, although their interests are intertwined more often than not.\n\nDespite the clear intentions of the government to appoint Margarete Von Wrangell, a prestigious Noble and first Female professor at a Baltic-German university, to the position, Alfred Rosenberg has tossed his hat into the ring as well. Rosenberg, having failed to centralize power around himself as Head of State, now aims to consolidate what is rest of the government for himself, essentially cutting Chancellor Kroeger off from the entire government. That being said, his chances of seizing any power beyond what he currently has is slim. \n\nIn contrast, Von Wrangell is enjoying a large amount of support from both her supporters in the government as well as  those among the common folk who think a female foreign minister might be a nice change of pace. However, she still faces the hurdle of social conservatism, which is deeply embedded in Baltic-German culture. \n\nIs accepting gridlock worth keeping women out of politics? Is preventing gridlock worth the endless calls for women's suffrage which would surely come as a result? The Duchy has much to consider when choosing its next Foreign Minister."

This minister shall lead the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acting with some degree of independence from the central government. That being said, the domestic and foreign affairs departments collaborate frequently and often act in tandem with one another.\n\nDespite failing to be elected twice in a row, Alfred Rosenberg has once again nominated himself for the position. In Rosenberg's mind, it is acceptable that his political mentor be leader of the Duchy, as long as he is able to at least manage foreign affairs. After all, the matter of whether or not to go to war and build a Pan-Nordic German Empire is where Kroeger and Rosenberg primarily disagree.\n\nHowever, Rosenberg's lofty plans seem unlikely to come to fruition, as Margarete Von Wrangell is swiftly rising up as the prime candidate for the position. Von Wrangell is an esteemed Baroness, as well as the first female professor to teach at a Baltic-German university. She may not have much political experience, but her competence and intelligence cannot be overstated, even be the somewhat socially backwards Duchy.\n\nIs this the end of Rosenberg's career, or perhaps his final chance to shine? Will Von Wrangell be able to secure her victory in spite of her gender? These questions and more will be answered when the foreign minister is finally elected."
