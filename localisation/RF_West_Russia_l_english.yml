#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
WRU_DESC_MENU:0 "The Baltic General Governorate was revived in 1916 in an attempt to try and better organise forces to fight against the German Empire. Many native Baltic peoples demanded equal rights and treatments due to their volunteering in the Great War, and Russian workers in the region also suffered as well, prompting considerable support for Communism. These demands led to a conflict in the region with the start of the Civil War lasting long into 1921. However, opposition was swiftly crushed under the leadership of Pavel Bermondt-Avalov. As the cracks in the regime begin to show from the results of the 1935 labour strikes, only time will tell what awaits."

wru.1.t:0 "Note in the Docks"
wru.1.desc:0 "A dense mist slept upon the dark port of Yur'yev, and the crash of the waves was all that disturbed the early morning silence. Ever since the end of the Great War, the docks saw significantly less traffic with merchants prefering to bring their goods through the much cheaper ports in Prussia or straight to Petrograd. It made the job of the local customs department significantly easy, but it also made the dock prime target. A note, unsigned, printed in broken Russian, was found attached to a suspiciously unlabeled crate, and it read:\n\n\"Soon: the worker's revolution. Prepare: your whole rotten structure shall collapse!\""
wru.1.a:0 "Throw it away, nothing to worry about."
wru.2.t:0 "They Came from the East"
wru.2.desc:0 "The west moving colonists did not have the appearance of people fleeing poverty or oppression. They arrived in cars and trucks, large convoys of them. Loaded down with well made and pricey possessions, the vehicles each pulled into large manors overlooking the fields and farms. Landlords. Foreign landlords, coming on behalf of the Russian government. They were healthy, jovial people, eyes glittering, dressed in fine clothing and carrying the like of gold pocket watches. They smoked better tobacco, and drank the finest alcohols, imports from Britain.\nNew lives in new lands, plenty of opportunities for profit, and the total blessing of their own government to do it. It was no surprise, really that so many wealthy Russians headed west. Bit by bit, little by little, these laughing, good looking people owned all the farmland anyone could see. As the cars and trucks moved past, children pointed out of the windows of these fashionable vehicles at the beautiful landscapes and rolling fields, and even more at the poor and dispossessed locals that could be found labouring on both sides of the roads. Hunched, tired figures, overcast like the skies overhead.\nThe children of these families didn't notice the sullen glares boring through the windows of their cars, but the adults must have been able to, if they bothered to look."
wru.2.a:0 "New masters coming to roost."
wru.3.t:0 "Murder in the Countryside"
wru.3.desc:0 "Nikolai couldn't get to sleep. Swaddled in the cocoon of his sheets, he sweat horribly. The night was cool, a gentle breeze blew in through the open window, and yet, the weight of his sheets felt stifling. He hid in them, nevertheless. The footsteps were back. They paced beneath his window, subtle, but all too real. Nikolai clenched his eyes shut. The third night in a row, the unseen visitor stalked back and forth through the garden, each footfall heavy and hateful.\nWorse, Nikolai's father refused to believe him. Ivan Mikhailovich Seremov had rolled his eyes, dismissing his child's fears as nerves in a new and alien country. Nikolai knew better. He knew those feet outside his window were not an animal's, or the product of his imagination. Outside, someone coughed. Nikolai hoped his father heard it.\n But nothing happened.\nAcross the room, Tatyana's soft breathing was the only other sound in the room.\nNikolai considered getting out of bed and calling father again. He froze as the front door opened. The creaking hinges, so familiar by day, were alien and hostile by night, foreboding and menacing. They groaned, long, loud. Someone heard this. Finally, someone knew he wasn't lying. The maid was up. He heard her, next door, muttering something to herself. Her feet were not sure in the dark as she blearily found her way to her door and opened it. Nikolai held his breath as the plump woman padded down the stairs.\nHe nearly choked in fear as she screamed. It was a drawn out, blood curdling thing, filled with terror and pain. It wavered and warbled between the wet sounds of impact. With a sickening thud, the maid's voice died in her throat. Tatyana was awake now, already sobbing quietly. There was a brief pause before a pair of boots began to thump towards the stairs. Nikolai was almost frozen in fear, but forced himself out of bed as he heard his father's door slam open. Just two days ago, Ivan had told him to be a man.\nHe opened his door as his father came storming down the hall, his old officer's sabre clenched in one fist. Ivan's tired blue eyes locked onto Nikolai's own.\n“Go back to your room,” he said, storming past, “Protect your sister.”\nNikolai retreated. Tatyana was sitting bolt upright in bed, tears shining against the blue-white half light of the moon outside.\nIvan yelled something at the unseen force advancing up the stairs. Then, he too began to scream. This wasn't piercing, and though it was agonized, it wasn't nearly as frightened as the maids' had been. A man snarled, voice hate filled and wordless. Nikolai heard another pair of feet rush from his parents' bedroom and towards his."
wru.3.a:0 "Mother!"
wru.4.t:0 "Murder in the Countryside - Continued"
wru.4.desc:0 "The man's feet shot up the stairs and pounded quicker than Nikolai could believe across the long hall. No screams now, only a thud, and the sound of something wet and fleshy, like the sound meat makes in a butcher's shop. Nikolai squeezed his eyes shut, shielding his trembling sister behind him, facing the door, hoping against hope that the presence on the other side was not the unknown visitor. That somehow, his father had won the fight in the end.\nThe handle turned.\nNikolai opened his eyes, forcing himself to witness whatever it was that stood before him. It was all he could do not to tremble. He was rooted to the spot. The man was dressed in black, face shrouded by a hood. His eyes glinted, cool and hard in the moonlight. At his feet, the ruin of Nikolai's mother, head staved in. Her blood shone, crimson and chunky with flesh.\nTatyana wailed.\nNikolai tried to remain brave for his sister. He tried to be a man, to honour the military heritage of his family.\n“It is important,” Ivan's voice echoed in his head, “For a man to die with dignity.”\nStill, he flinched as the axe came up, shining and wicked, trailing flecks of castoff."
wru.4.a:0 "Who could perpetrate such a terrible crime?"
wru.5.t:0 "The Hard Toil"
wru.5.desc:0 "Andrus worked a sixteen hour day. He hated it. He hated the sweat pouring into his eyes. He hated the blisters that formed on his hands, painful and hot. He hated when they burst. He hated the endless manual labour, the silent fear that dominated the fields that he and his colleagues worked in. But above all, he hated the German aristocrats that had all but forced him to do this. They didn't need to put guns on him. They controlled the food, the markets, the money, everything. There was no other work, not for an Estonian. Andrus was either a slave in all but name, or he'd starve to death.\nHe glared at the overseer watching them. Far from the stereotypical view of a slavemaster, the Baron was not an angry or cruel looking man. Rather, he was rosy cheeked and jolly. Quick to laughter, the Baron did not seem at all the kind of person that would hopelessly sweat men for nothing. But as the Baron looked back and forth over the workers below him, Andrus knew the truth. The smile on the baron's face went no further than his lips.\nThe man next to him grunted as he fell, legs unable to support him. They were barely paid anything, and they had to pay for room and board on top of it. Andrus knew that he and the rest were slowly dying. He glanced back up at the Baron. Cold eyes locked onto his, shadowed beneath the overcast sky. The Baron glanced at the fallen man next to Andrus. He pointed to the prostrate form, head turning to the guard standing next to him, pristinely uniformed in pipe grey. The soldier, hands folded neatly behind his back, simply nodded.\nThe Baron turned and waddled away.\nThe next day, the man next to Andrus was gone.\nAndrus toiled on. He just wanted one good meal."
wru.5.a:0 "It's for your own good."
wru.6.t:0 "The Trial"
wru.6.desc:0 "Matis spoke no more than two words during the entirety of his trial. There wasn't time for more. The trial didn't last any longer than five minutes.\n\n“Not guilty.”\n\nThese words themselves were difficult, bruised and beaten as he was. The Russian soldiers that had worked as stand ins for local police had been downright brutal. Matis was missing two teeth from a rifle butt smashed into his jaw. The Russians had snarled as they did it, stooping over his fallen form. It was a mercy that the initial shock of the blow had made him insensate enough to dull the pain of the flurry of kicks and baton blows that they had delivered against him on the night of his arrest.\nThe jury, there were four of them, glared down at him from where they sat elevated, perpendicular to the judge. Two Russians, two Germans, all aristocrats. Not one of them was a native Balt. The judge glowered down at him. An imposing, stonefaced Russian, he launched into a tirade that the translator standing nervously next to him could barely keep up with.\nMatis was a communist, the judge exclaimed, he absolutely had cause to slaughter an upper class Russian family.  He was a deranged murderer, and still he had the gall to lie. The judge's face seemed to turn red, then purple as he worked himself into a frothing rage at the depravity of Matis's supposed crime. Matis knew that this was a formality. He hadn't seen his comrades in a week. Probably already dead, he reflected.\nIt didn't surprise him when the sentence was passed down.\n“Death.”\nMatis didn't even have the energy to struggle as he was dragged from the room in chains. The scaffold was not far away. As he was led to it, he took a moment to observe the sky. Grey again. Mournful. Would it cry for him today? What he assumed were the extended family of those poor victims stood facing him, glowering in hatred. Matis wanted to tell them he didn't do it, that he and his comrades had gone no further than reading Marx.\nNo point. Even if they cared about whether he was guilty or not...even if they were real, they too were caught up in the frenzy.\nAs the noose was tied around his neck, Matis shook his head at the priest. He needed no blessing, not now. He was already damned.\n“Do you have any last words?” His executioner demanded.\nThe truth, one last time.\n“I never touched the-”\nThe trapdoor opened."
wru.6.a:0 "The animal is dead!"
wru.7.t:0 "Rosenberg forms Corps Rubonia Squads"
wru.7.desc:0 "It had been midnight by this point. After spending countless hours trying to figure out how to do reprisals to the perpetrators of the horrible murder, realizing that it was not the actions of just nationalist, but an United Front of Latvian-Estonian nationalists, minorities, Communists, and internationalist liberals. Therefore, the organization of Corps Rubonia death squads across the country, be them legally operated or not, is key to maintaining German prowess in the Governorate. At least - that is what Rosenberg believes. While there haven't been clashes between the Corps Rubonia squads and the local police (as they have similar interests), there have been reports of violent reprisals against Latvians and Estonians."
wru.7.a:0 "We will keep an eye on him."
wru.8.t:0 "Darkness Prevailed"
wru.8.desc:0 "\"Hey, are you going to just look vacantly at the trees?\" said Maximovich, who had been searching across the forests of Estonia for any remnant of partisan activity - any evidence. \n \"No, I was just admiring this beautiful day.\", said Bezrukov.\n\"Yeah, you pansy, i'm sure you'd love to look around the forest all day. Listen, we need to find some evidence of partisan activity in the area. Do your job.\"\n\nThe police corps had been searching for hours now, their supplies growing thinner and the day disappearing as the night took over. Perhaps it was time to go home and rest? No, they were assigned to find something. We have lanterns, we can deal with the darkness.\n\n \"Maximovich! I found something!\" said someone else, namely Mazhulin. \"What is it?\" said he, arriving to Mazhulin's area, but before he could see what he was, his vision went black, and he fell on the ground, hearing grass touch his face, now covered by some kind of cloth. He began to hear gunfire, and people falling down the ground - screaming in pain, one of them painfully close to him. He felt something knock against his head, and so he fell unconscious."
wru.8.a:0 "We will never know."
wru.9.t:0 "In Search of Nothing"
wru.9.desc:0 "Droves began going like lambs into the slaughter, as the forest swallowed them whole. People began getting desperate as local villagers saw more and more policemen going in and not coming back. Reports of survivors are scarce and far in between, as oftentimes whatever is disappearing all these people is for certain stronger than previously imagined. Baltic aristocrats talked about it being an \"United Front\", as touted by Rosenberg and his Corps Rubonia squads. Government officials said nothing - they just kept sending in more people to find out what was going on. It seems like something is taking over more and more territory, and it hasn't given us time to rest."
wru.9.a:0 "Send in the army! This needs to end!"
wru.10.t:0 "Marching, Marching"
wru.10.desc:0 "The Army marched like automatons towards their goal: Rural southeastern Estonia. An overwhelming force of 10,000 soldiers, it was not something that would be stopped by prowess of some partisans. And so, the Army marched forward, an unstoppable force meeting a movable object - hopefully. And so, arriving at the place where most policemen disappeared, it seems that there was a complicated system of traps all across the whole of the Baltics, set up by nationalists who have been fighting off Russification. Perhaps the strangest thing is the inability to recover them - the Baltics is not a large place - where could they be? Police began going around the country along with the Army knocking on doors of villages, rural communities, and even raiding some suspected places only to find nothing. What could possibly be happening in these damned swamps?"
wru.10.a:0 "We will know shortly."
wru.11.t:0 "Wiping the Dirt"
wru.11.desc:0 "As our Army marched into the countryside, we walked around the forest only to notice certain patterns in the houses. They often had a blue paint smeared on the wall, visible in plain sight. Noticing this, an Army Corps entered one of the houses and began scouring through it, finding weapons and multiple Estonian nationalists ready to fight for their cause. It seems this was the main cause behind the recent terror attacks, and we believe stability will reign in from now on."
wru.11.a:0 "Excellent news."
wru.12.t:0 "The March of 13th November"
wru.12.desc:0 "Thousands of Baltic peoples have had enough.\n\nWhile the Government expected the locals to approve of their efforts to hunt down the people kidnapping policemen and military people, it seems that it only showed to them that the Baltic General-Governorate is inefficient at helping their own citizens find stability, and have no ability in stopping local partisans from being anything but a day-to-day reality for rural village people. Perhaps, it was high time that they would do something about it - and so they did - beginning a march that would start in Riga and would end in Dvinsk. It appeared that things were going surprisingly well for the Latvian students protesting, yet it seemed that the place was teeming with tension as the local police began to push the protesters away from main squares, forcing them into smaller neighborhoods - cramped and irritated. Subsequently, the \"shot heard around the Baltics\" was fired - where a Russian soldier fired out of panic and fear of the harassing Latvians, who had injured one of his friends. The shot hit nobody, but it set a precedent that things were about to get much bloodier.\n\nLatvian students and impromptu \"militias\" had begun firing against the police, and subsequently the fight between families holding old rifles and using them in the march, and brutal hand-to-hand fighting against one another meant that the peaceful March (although many claim that it was never intended to be peaceful), not quite ending when expected, resulted in almost twenty deaths on all sides."
wru.12.a:0 "And so it begins."
wru.13.t:0 "Central Government retracts all contracts"
wru.13.desc:0 "The Central Government of the Baltic-General Governorate has decided, on these times of emergency, to rescind and retract all Government contracts with foreign companies. What this will entail is still up to the Government and the local Duma, and several options are on the table - nationalize the \"Union\", company, nationalizing the Riga Shipyard, or having an agreement with local landlords to secure their interests by giving them land grants on the previously undeveloped land. What shall be done?"
wru.13.a: "Nationalize \"Union\"."
wru.13.b:0 "Nationalize the Riga Shipyard."
wru.13.c:0 "Make an agreement with landlords."
wru.14.t:0 "Question of Army Loyalty"
wru.14.desc:0 "Our Army has several subversive elements within it. This is fact - otherwise how would so many of our patrols disappear, and our army be consistently defeated at the hands of small partisan corps? It is nescessary, then, that we begin an effort of purging our army of certain groups and favoring others. The Freikorps, very much a powerful section of the Army, are, obviously, German-only batallions fighting for anti-communism. The Russians, the other group allowed in our Army, are largely colonists without enough wealth to bribe officials off of being drafted. Thusly, we need to decide which one to favor - otherwise our Army might collapse."
wru.14.a:0 "The Russians are the largest section of our army. We need them."
wru.14.b:0 "The Freikorps are more loyal than anything!"
wru.15.t:0 "The Start of the Baltic Civil War"
wru.15.desc:0 "At 3:00 p.m today, several posts across the General Governorate stopped communicating with Riga, and even some small streets of Riga itself began getting barricaded. Especially rural sectors have gone to complete radio silence - and so our remaining posts were ordered to enter those areas, only to find barricades and armed civilians, soldiers, and even the elderly fighting in several banners not raised in this land for decades. The line between combatant and bystander became invisible as several houses began forcing any police to leave, resulting in small pockets of several allegiances across the Governorate. Chaos runs the streets as people shoot eachother for food, and those who were prepared even have multiple posts with armed citizens ready to shoot anyone trying to enter. People across the Governorate are confused, but at the same time feeling a nescessity to align to some kind of group, even if they are everything from the Internationalists to the pro-government Freikorps. It appears that every attempt at securing our rule has failed, except for this one last chance to redeem ourselves."
wru.15.a:0 "To arms!"
wru.16.t:0 "Give Government support to the Corps Rubonia?"

wru.17.desc:0 "In response to the ever-worsening political situation in Europe, as well as its own internal conflicts, the Baltic General Governorate has announced today the creation of a youth military organization known as the “Young Army”, or Yunarmija. The response has been one of national outrage at what is a transparent attempt to foster loyalty amongst the youth. The government in Riga has responded with a rather ominous message in their official statement: “We must face the reality that the radicalism abroad and turmoil within our own borders will naturally lead to war. It may not come for some time, but it is inevitable, whether or not it is easy to admit. And when the time comes, our children shall not be left to waste away in the trenches of destroyed towns, as they were in the destruction of the Great War. Instead, they shall defend themselves, and fight proudly for the preservation of peace in our region.” There are many who oppose this line of thought, even within the most militaristic political circles, but with Riga having backing from the Russian Empire, the chance of any pushback being successful is slim to none. Thus, the organization shall begin operations soon, with this historic day being honored as “Foundation Day”.\nIn order to gain perspective, a young man, age fourteen, was interviewed. When asked why he decided to join, the boy responded, “I'm not sure. My parents said this would help make me into a man, so I signed up alongside my friends.”."

Yesterday, the official request for weapons by the German-Baltic student union was approved, and a box full of surplus weapons as well as some brand-new rifles was shipped from Petrograd to Riga. At first, the University post office was rather alarmed to see a shipment of weapons delivered to the school, but when the officers of the student union explained the situation, the guns were handed over with little protest. Now, if you were to walk the campus of the University of Riga, you could hear drill sergeants barking and the sound of gunfire anywhere you went. Despite student complaints about noise and being unable to study, the Corps have hardened their stance, saying that anyone who doesn't like the sound of German patriotism should simply transfer to Tallinn University.\nIt is yet unclear whether the Russian government endorses the stated mission of the organization, although their amicable interactions would certainly suggest some sort of sympathies. Foreign policy analysts have been quick to point out that the deposed monarchy of Germany actually was related to the Romanovs by way of Queen Victoria, so perhaps Russia is using this tenuous connection to justify arming its political allies against Councilist Germany. Although we may never know the truth of the matter, it is undeniable that Russia and German Monarchists have shared interests, and that cooperation would be highly beneficial to both parties."

All across the region, divisions of various paramilitary and military groups began randomly attacking one another, without so much as a warning to the civilian population. Cities have been devastated, fields have been razed, and bodies now litter this corner of the Latvian countryside. At the forefront of the fighting is Pavel-Bermondt Avalov, liberator of our Baltic territories during the Russian civil war. And now that the fighting has broken out, the esteemed commander has been tasked with putting down the partisan forces. However, Avalov has little choice in his strategies outside of two courses of action: go on the offensive and risk losing crucial manpower, or fortify Dvinsk and Jakobstadt and wait for a better opportunity to attack.

As for Commander Avalov, he has been killed by his own mutinous soldiers. Apparently, a Councilist cell surrounding Avalov revealed its intentions when the army collapsed and captured Avalov before executing him.\nThe Baltics are now teeming with Civil War, a once united and prosperous region now disunited and at each other's throats. Though the conflict was inevitable, one can't help but mourn the passing of peace in the Baltics. However, now is the time when the future of the Baltic nations will be decided.

Yet, here were the Nationalists, bashing the doors down and ordering the politicians to get on the ground while the security forces draw their weapons. First, one of the agents pulled out his pistol and shot a Nationalist as he rushed the man next to him with a bayonet. This single shot caused a thousand bullets to ring out through the old capitol building, leaving deep bullet marks in the walls as well as piercing their targets. Men died on both sides, but in the end, the Nationalists simply outnumbered the fledgling bodyguards and decimated them before taking the politicians hostage, lining them up in the rows they once sat in. The head of the partisans asked one simple question to the congregation: “Will you support our independent government, where Estonians reign supreme above all?” All who failed to reply in the affirmative were instantly shot and killed, their bodies being thrown on the steps of the capitol building as an example to those who refuse to swear loyalty to Independent Estonia.

Luckily, most of the fighting is still going on between the partisans, who aim to destroy one another before taking the capitol and establishing their state. Government figures have expectedly fled, but the citizens remain trapped inside the city walls. The police have tried to escort as many people as they can out of the city, but partisan battles have prevented many evacuations. As the people fear for their lives, those who seek to rule them battle in destructive conflict.

As soon as visual contact was established, both sides began trading fire, with Councilists and Nationalists temporarily cooperating in order to sweep away the last remains of the old government. The fight raged on for much longer than some may have expected, with the police and government bodyguards repelling partisan invaders for several hours despite being drastically outnumbered. Once the partisans finally broke through the doors, they were treated to a bloodbath as they were mowed down in the crowded hallways. However, a human wave can never truly be stopped.

Of course, the civil war will inevitably need to continue, only so that it may end. At this point, however, most people are simply anxious for all of it to end, and couldn't care less who wins. As the partisans leave to return to their key positions, they leave behind them a trail of death and destruction which will always be remembered.

By midmorning, a pitched battle largely uncharacteristic of the Baltic War was raging across several districts of the city. Russo-German battalions moved house-to-house in places as they counterattacked, while several neighborhoods fell quickly to Nationalist control as local Estonian sympathizers attempted their own piecemeal risings.However, as the Estonian advanced stalled out and the Russian artillery firing from the Põhja-Tallinn peninsula in the north of the city - beyond the reach of the partisans - found their range, it became increasingly apparent that the Nationalists had overestimated their ability to face a regular army head-on. The Russian artillery, along with gunboats from the remnants of the local Baltic Fleet squadron on station, leveled entire neighborhoods to break Estonian concentrations and allow the infantry to maneuver and envelope the areas still under Partisan control.Mopping-up operations are ongoing, and while some Estonian groups have managed to exfiltrate from the city, but by nightfall a majority of the survivors had surrendered to the Russian regulars (who are at least in theory subject to some legal restraint) rather than risk the dubious mercy of the monarchist irregulars. While the Estonian Nationalist forces have not been destroyed, today marks a clear nadir in their power - the leadership of the General-Governorate is already discussing steps to begin re-assuring direct authority over the region surrounding Tallinn."

However, despite his vast amount of qualifications, Rosenberg has become well-known for his outlandish racial and religious theories. Rosenberg believes that Baltic-Germans are just one part of the Nordic race, a race which should go on to rule the world due to their superiority. Rosenberg also claims that among the Nordic groups, Germans were of the purest blood, although the Balts who occupy much of the Duchy's landmass were given a position not too far beneath.\nThe other frontrunner is Erhard Kroeger, who promises a broad yet thoroughly Anti-Councilist policy agenda. Kroeger took the rise of the partisans as a sign that Councilism had become a significant threat in the Baltics, however, he does not apply the same logic to the Nationalists, who he says he would be more than happy to work with in ridding the Duchy of Councilism.\nOne interesting aspect of this race is the relationship between Kroeger and Rosenberg, as Rosenberg is somewhat of a political protege to Kroeger. Rosenberg is running against his former ally because he feels that Kroeger has betrayed his own doctrine by focusing entirely on Anti-Councilism rather than building a strong German-Batlic society. That being said, should Kroeger assume the office, it's not unlikely that Kroeger will appoint Rosenberg to a position of political leadership.\nKroeger may not have as much governing experience, but he also lacks Rosenberg's… eccentricities.

wru.107.desc:0 "With Chancellor Kroeger and Vice-Chancellor Scheubner-Richter now elected, the time has now come to elect the foreign minister. This minister shall lead the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acting with some degree of independence from the central government. That being said, the domestic and foreign affairs departments collaborate frequently and often act in tandem with one another.\n\nDespite failing to be elected twice in a row, Alfred Rosenberg has once again nominated himself for the position. In Rosenberg's mind, it is acceptable that his political mentor be leader of the Duchy, as long as he is able to at least manage foreign affairs. After all, the matter of whether or not to go to war and build a Pan-Nordic German Empire is where Kroeger and Rosenberg primarily disagree.\n\nHowever, Rosenberg's lofty plans seem unlikely to come to fruition, as Margarete Von Wrangell is swiftly rising up as the prime candidate for the position. Von Wrangell is an esteemed Baroness, as well as the first female professor to teach at a Baltic-German university. She may not have much political experience, but her competence and intelligence cannot be overstated, even be the somewhat socially backwards Duchy.\n\nIs this the end of Rosenberg's career, or perhaps his final chance to shine? Will Von Wrangell be able to secure her victory in spite of her gender? These questions and more will be answered when the foreign minister is finally elected."
