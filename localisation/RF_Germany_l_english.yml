DEUTSCHE_RATEREPUBLIK_DESC:0 "1918년의 혁명과 내전 이후 독일은 고립되었습니다. 많은 국가들이 독일과의 교류를 거부하고 프로이센을 독일의 정통국가로 선포했습니다. 그러나 붉은 독일은 리프크네히트와 그의 후계자 레비의 아래에서 번영했습니다. 1936년까지의 몇 년 동안 공산당은 엄청난 진전을 이루어 냈습니다. 독일의 경제를 회복시키고 코민테른을 결성했으며, 독일에서 자신들의 입지를 강화하는 데 성공했습니다. 불경기가 다가오고, 러시아, 프랑스, 영국이 사활을 걸고 경제문제와 씨름할 때 독일은 아무런 영향을 받지 않았습니다. 충성스러운 군대, 국민의 지지, 그리고 세상을 개편하려는 열망을 가진 독일은 실로 무시할 수 없는 존재입니다."

#Leader descriptions
POLITICS_Levi_DESC:0 "The successors of great men and women have their own burdens to bear.\n\nPaul Levi was born, amusingly, in Hohenzollern Province in Prussia. His entry into the legal field in 1906 coincided with his entry into the SPD, where he rapidly became associated with the party's left flank and future luminaries of German history – including Rosa Luxemburg, who he would frequently serve as legal counsel. Elected to the town council of Frankfurt shortly after the start of the Great War, Levi was present for the momentous events of the SPD's banning and radicalization. After narrowly escaping arrest, he would shelter in Switzerland with other notable communists until the start of the German Revolution. Later, under Red Rosa's government, he would mostly flit from position to position within the party, appreciated for his bureaucratic experience but largely overlooked in favour of the other members of the old guard – at least, until he felt the hand of Chairman Kautsky on his shoulder.\n\nWith the unifying force of Rosa gone, Paul Levi seemed an unassuming compromise choice for the premiership in 1928. even if Lenin and the other hardliners would split from the party a year later, it had long seemed inevitable. But something had changed in the old revolutionary lawyer. Maybe factional politics had disillusioned him with some of his fellow revolutionaries. Maybe it was witnessing the practical difficulties of rebuilding the first socialist state in Europe. Or maybe it was watching the radicals in the foreign ministry doing their best to isolate Germany from potential allies – the Fiumeans, the Irish, even the Russian communists. At least, the \"realist\" flank of the SPD had similar concerns, and he listened.\n\nWhatever the cause, Premier Levi has pursued a policy of \"normalization\" since his rise – or to some, a rank betrayal of Rosa's legacy. Pursuing a less antagonistic relationship with the rest of Europe. Entertaining foreign trade. Opening the door for reform of the German economy. However one characterizes his approach – whether cowardice or pragmatism – the SPD has remained in power through the change of leadership. But the international situation is not static, as the rise of Artaud in France has demonstrated, and neither are politics. It remains to be seen whether this \"course correction\" will last."
POLITICS_Popper_DESC:0 "Our circumstances shape us, and Karl Popper is no exception. Lord knows a Viennese intellectual from a mixed Jewish, Hungarian, Bohemian, Silesian, and Austrian background would fit better today in the house Franz Ferdinand built. For a time, this was true, and as a bookish 16-year-old he would already be attending the University of Vienna as a guest student. Unfortunately, this happened to coincide with the worst of the Great War for Austria-Hungary, and the recent convert to Marxism narrowly escaped death at the hands of the state and mob by fleeing into Germany in 1919. The events in his homeland would, in retrospect, weigh heavily upon his later politics.\n\nThe wayward Austrian would wear many hats in the 1920s: a woodworker, a doctorate student in German's changing educational system, at one point even a teacher at a school for the many orphans the war and Revolution had left behind – but also growing closer to the Alte Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands. Karl would start standing in council elections later in the decade. For a party seeking to shed its image of being an inveterate Wilhelmine remnant, Popper's growing public presence was a godsend, and when snap elections were called, the older generation of Bernsteinists were willing to stand aside to take a gamble on him – one that succeeded.\n\nWhat to make of Premier Popper, then? While he has seen the success of the revolution in his adopted country, he knows there are a half dozen others where it has failed, and he has seen the human cost of both. He has seen how fragile the democratic vestiges of any state can be, and has left doctrinaire Marxism behind for reasons of humanism and a suspicion that socialism is not inevitable after all. Not without sympathy for the \"normalization\" that eventually doomed Paul Levi, Karl Popper and the ASPD have come to steer the socialist republic toward a just and free future, if they can unite the dissident social democrats in their cause."
POLITICS_Reventlow_DESC:0 "Two decades ago, as with many Germans, Ernst Reventlow's life was set on a radically different path. Born in a disparaged \"grey town by the sea\" to Danish nobility, Ernst Christian Einar Ludvig Detlev was an aristocrat who served with some distinction in the Imperial Navy. A forced resignation due to, of all things, taking a French wife seemed a sign of how his strong will could get him into trouble. This would only continue in the Great War, where he turned his freelancer's pen to decrying the wartime government as insufficiently committed to victory – eventually leading to a slander lawsuit that was not resolved by the time of the German Revolution.\n\nThe noble shorn of his title would find himself an uneasy fellow traveller with the new socialist republic. Though he had been sympathetic to the revolting soldiers in North Germany, the prospect of a patriotic socialism that would appeal to him seemed laughable until the Deutsche Sozialrepublikanische Partei's formation in 1923. Through association with the GSRN that had formed from the soldiers' councils, Reventlow was slowly convinced to discard the last vestiges of his nobility and join the DSRP, now a committed convert to the cause. By the 1930s, with the first generation of the party's leadership starting to move on, he was suddenly a grey eminence, introducing his appreciation for the classics and old Germania into the organization's discourse with his \"Widukindisch\" faction. And now, after a strategic alliance with other communists who understood the appeal of nationalism, not to mention his connections with the GSRN-turned-SRNP, the world can speak of Premier Reventlow.\n\nNaturally, a former aristocrat taking the reins of socialism's heartland was enough cause to raise an eyebrow before even considering what a titanic cultural shift he represents. Gone is the staid professionalism of the SPD, and its urban focus has partially shifted with the rise of a party that extols the rural peasantry. Reventlow's hands have forged a connection between the maximal revolutionaries of the SRNP and KPD and the more culturally conservative socialists of the German nation – even some of the CSABP, despite his professed commitment to increased state laïcité. It remains to be seen what his personal politics and his coalition will produce, but the new Premier can promise his supporters one thing — The future belongs to Germany."
POLITICS_Radek_DESC:0 "Is there a man in Germany who has profited more from association with the exiled Russian Vladimir Lenin? Karl Radek, born Karol Sobelsohn in the hinterland of Austria-Hungary, has been on the outside of many \"mainline\" socialist movements since he arrived in Germany in 1907, fleeing a Russian prison sentence. While he had been a member of Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania alongside future Premier Luxemburg, his political career as an exile got off to a much rockier start. Factional politics within the SPD, along with his strident criticism of Karl Kautsky and alignment with Lenin, cost Radek too many allies at a time when he was being smeared by his old Polish allies. It was probably only the outbreak of the Great War in 1913 and the flight of socialists like him into Switzerland that spared him ejection from the party.\n\nSwiss exile solidified Radek's connections with other foreign communists, a grouping he was frequently on the far left of. However, when the fires of the Great War were replaced with the fires of revolution, Radek was already in Bremen coordinating militias and expropriations. With the SPD ultimately victorious, he would soon fall in with Lenin again after his frequent debate partner returned victorious from Hungary. While the so-called \"Leninist\" grouping of radicals would be satisfied with a number of governmental positions – Lenin's time as Foreign Secretary, for better or worse, had gallons of ink spilled over it – it was only a matter of time before the final rupture of the Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands with the SPD, established in 1929 by all manner of party radicals.\n\nA long and winding road of opposition ended with Karl Radek coming to power in Germany. Fellow socialists being butchered in the streets of Austria, in Radek's view, only further highlighted the price of a \"compromised\" socialist leadership in Germany, but how would the hegemonic SPD be displaced? Lenin's pragmatism on recognizing the national question, combined with a reassessment of why men like Heinrich Laufenberg had broken from the SPD to form the DSRP, brought Radek to his final conclusions — nationalism could be channeled towards left-wing ends, could it not? A strategic alliance with the DSRP has placed Premier Radek at the head of a coalition of revolutionary agrarians, hardline Leninists, and the oft-neglected council-communist wing of the KPD. All of them are united in the cause of an intensified revolution. 1919 was only the beginning. Let the reactionaries within and without tremble!"
POLITICS_Goebbels_DESC:0 "Tracing the road taken by Premier Joseph Goebbels, the helmsman of the revolution, one would perhaps be shocked to find a sickly young boy who once entertained becoming a priest. Spared from the draft during the Great War by a persistent foot deformation, the anti-Catholic trend of the Ludendorff dictatorship would drive him to take up arms with the SPD in 1918. Though he would eventually complete his PhD despite delays caused by the fighting in the German Revolution and the shakeup of academia that followed, the sorrows of young Joseph were many in the early 1920s. What did his studies of romantic literature mean in a Germany trying to break from its past? What did dreams of becoming a popular writer mean when he could only be published as a small-time journalist? His personal and professional isolation led to him reading voraciously while searching for purpose, and with the initial revolutionary fury of the new republic, this mostly led him to the work of Germany's socialist luminaries.\n\nIt was soon after the 1923 formation of the DSRP that Goebbels, finding something familiar and compelling in the rhetoric he heard, applied for membership and work in the new party. The party of outsiders saw the merits in promoting a man who rose to fight in the revolution despite his condition - Finding his place as a propagandist and writer for party papers, he would develop a carefully-practised style of public speaking that made him invaluable to recruitment efforts. However, his evocation of the German past he'd studied to find revolutionary rhetoric and imagery would form a dialectic with his budding socialist consciousness, and the errant romantic found his mind circling the imagery of 1848 and the revolutionaries who gave their lives for the dream of a liberated Germany. The synthesis was an articulated doctrine of social republicanism that would be embraced by his followers within the party, the \"Heckerisch\" wing.\n\nFinally leveraging his talents to upend the DSRP's political hierarchy, an alliance with other dissident communists has delivered Premier Goebbels to power. Some, the timid and traditional-minded, suspect him a reactionary. Nothing could be further from the truth. Rather, the new programme of government brings the traditions – German traditions – of revolt and revolution together with socialism to create a government suited to this German context. Premier Goebbels has promised a socialism to realize the promise of 1848, of both the Communist Manifesto and the heirs of Hegel and the Enlightenment. All he asks of the people is that they are prepared for the terrible, total struggle it will require."
POLITICS_Brecht_DESC:0 "The first generation of German revolutionaries exits the stage, and a new one takes its place – but does the same director not hold the script? Eugen Berthold Friedrich Brecht was born into a mixed Catholic and Lutheran family in Augsburg, living a reasonably comfortable middle class life until the Revolution. Even so, once the initial war fever wore off, the teenage Brecht would court trouble until his expulsion from school for, among other things, an essay mocking the sentiment of dying for one's country – a dangerous move under the Ludendorff dictatorship. Luckily, after a time as a teenage socialist militant, the rechristened \"Bert Brecht\" would return to school to complete his studies.\n\nAfter the revolution, however, Brecht got to work producing plays and poetry that made a splash on the German literary scene. The frantic, nervous energy of the man, possibly stemming from side effects of childhood rheumatic fever, was channeled into his feverish work. Taking in a complex stew of influences from the American comic actor Charlie Chaplin to the writings of Marx, his eye for social commentary and theories of a new \"epic\" style of theatre came close to utterly defining this sector of German art through the 20s and early 30s.\n\nFate would have other plans in mind, however, as the SPD chairman Karl Kautsky would exert his titanic influence on the party to de facto name Brecht as the successor to Paul Levi. In an SPD trying to assert its purpose after the doldrums of the previous administration, what then is the use of Premier Brecht? On one hand, a break from Levi's \"normalization\" to reignite the revolutionary fire once more. On the other, the creation of an official socialist cultural programme to stand against the accelerationists claiming the mantle of the artistic avant-garde. And so, the playwright takes the political stage."
POLITICS_Seghers_DESC:0 "Born Anna Reiling in the city of Mainz, the young \"Netty\" probably never would have expected to come this far. Her entire life up to adulthood was spent in the German Empire, and her life since has been under socialism. As if to add to some dramatic metanarrative about the state itself, her husband since the 1920s is even a Hungarian communist. Coincidences aside, nobody can deny the young writer and poet is a committed socialist, having even formally left her faith behind while working as an SPD operative.\n\nBut who is Anna Seghers, who has come to inhabit an old alias she used as an author and revolutionary? Her work has demonstrated an eye for the plight of those who suffer under dictatorships across the border, or give up their lives for an uncertain future away from tyranny. It has also cast a critical eye towards the radicals of the German opposition, as in her recent novel \"The Fellows,\" which warned of the consequences should the more nationalistically-minded parties take power and replicate the authoritarianism of the Wilhelmine Empire, or the Prussians and Austrians. Even so, Seghers has been willing to extoll the virtues of German poetry as a whole – a citing it as a tradition of liberty worth being proud of.\n\nFate would have other plans in mind for the poet, however, as the SPD chairman Karl Kautsky would exert his titanic influence on the party to de facto name Seghers as the successor to Paul Levi. In an SPD trying to assert its purpose after the doldrums of the previous administration, what then is the use of Premier Seghers? On one hand, a break from Levi's \"normalization\" to reignite the revolutionary fire once more. On the other, a blend of humanism and socialism intent on meeting tyranny on the field of battle. And so, the poet takes the political stage."
POLITICS_Frahm_DESC:0 "Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm was born into a country under siege, in the first winter of the Great War. For him, the first great political questions of the German Revolution were settled before he was even a teenager. If he was concerned with anything at the time, it was with growing up in Lubeck under a working mother thankfully assisted by her extended family. His growing political consciousness under the SPD nevertheless led him to join the party's youth wing, where he found a support structure he had been lacking and developed a true sense of community with his colleagues.\n\nHowever, the young Frahm gained increasing credibility in the socialist youth organizations as time went on. His charisma and looks led to him occasionally being tapped to go on diplomatic missions to foreign socialist parties, including in the Spanish Republic and United Kingdom. Some wondered about the true nature of these missions as time went on – perhaps it was merely an amusing coincidence that Frahm spoke fluent Norwegian on his visit to the northern country, so soon before the revolt against the government began, but who could say for certain? What is known is that he has done his utmost in the intervening years to maintain the SPD's appeal to young Germans, even as they increasingly resemble the political establishment itself.\n\nFate would have other plans in mind, however, as the SPD chairman Karl Kautsky would exert his titanic influence on the party to de facto name Frahm as the successor to Paul Levi. In an SPD trying to assert its purpose after the doldrums of the previous administration, what then is the use of Premier Frahm? On one hand, a break from Levi's \"normalization\" to reignite the revolutionary fire once more. On the other, a surprisingly canny political operator who represents the freshest face that Germany can put forth on the domestic and international stages. And so, the former youth leader takes the political stage."
POLITICS_Meyer_DESC:0 "Everything old is new again, it seems, as Ernst Meyer takes the reins of the republic. Like a number of his old colleagues, Meyer hails from Eastern Europe, though he was born in and pursued his PhD in Prussia rather than having Polish origins. Joining the SPD in 1908, he would become a major writer for the party newspaper \"Vorwärts\" even before his graduation. Like the other future revolutionary leadership, he ended up on the far left of the party, and he would also avoid persecution during the Great War by going into hiding – though he would surreptitiously travel between Germany and Switzerland as international socialist conferences and party activities demanded.\n\nThe outbreak of the German Revolution saw Meyer intensify his propaganda activities as a writer. Once the struggle was won, he would alternate between propaganda and doing major work in the economics ministry under Rosa Luxemburg's government. The ascent of Paul Levi and the \"Realists\" in 1928 would place Ernst firmly on the outside of the government's orthodoxy for a time, however, and he found himself focusing more on theory and journalism as his administrative portfolio rapidly declined. One of his major causes at the time was that the SPD would have to form alliances with suitable members of the opposition parties – creating a so-called united front - if it wanted to properly strengthen socialism. Alas, when Levi's star faded, Meyer assumed that it was time for the old guard of the revolution to step aside and cede power the new generation they had nurtured.\n\nFate would have other plans in mind, however, as the SPD chairman Karl Kautsky would exert his titanic influence on the party to de facto name Meyer as the successor to Paul Levi. In an SPD trying to assert its purpose after the doldrums of the previous administration, what then is the use of Premier Meyer? In general, a break from Levi's \"normalization\" to reignite the revolutionary fire once more, recapturing the fervor of 1918 within the party. And so, another of Red Rosa's colleagues takes the political stage once more..."

GER_democracy_of_proletariat:0 "프롤레타리아의 민주정"
GER_democracy_of_proletariat_desc:0 "Like many things in our Republic, the roots of our political system date way back to the revolution. When the workers revolted under the flag of Social Democracy in the West, the frontlines on the East saw their own rebellion - soldiers refusing to be cannon fodder for Ludendorff rose up under the leadership of such men as Otto Braun, Ernst Jünger, Karl Paetel or Ernst Röhm. All of them brave and noble comrades, they sympathised with the proletarian cause - just with one crucial difference, that almost led to a three-way civil war. Unlike the internationalists of the SPD, the soldiers saw the new Germany as a great, modern, national republic. \n\nThe situation was growing tense - and a compromise had to be made quickly. The nationalists couldn't accept the voices of some communists calling for a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", which demanded an one-party state ruled by the SPD. Instead - the workers' and soldiers' councils came in help. From that point, Germany was made a democratic council republic, with a central legislature elected by the members of local councils, where all parties that swore commitment to socialism could run. The first parties registered were the SPD and Paetel's Groups of Social Revolutionary Nationalists, which later reformed into the accelerationist SRNP. Soon, conservative nationalists, moderate revisionists, christian socialists and the Leninist ultra-left all formed their own factions - giving rise to a chaotic Republic of Councils and Parties."
GER_normalization_of_revolution:0 "혁명의 일반화"
GER_normalization_of_revolution_desc:0 "\"Cufflinks, suit, and tie. The uniform of the revolutionary of the golden centre. The working man's men since 1863. The ones who rebuffed challenges from the left and right, corrected course, and now stand bravely in defense of the revolution from our absurd and ruthless enemies in this world. We, the SPD, will take Germany to victory!\"\n\nPaul Levi's normalization campaign has so far been a mild success. The transition from imperial to radical uprooted Germany as whole, and in the years settling down, the rebuilding effort was decentralized among the councils. This localized issue would be the primary target under Levi, with mixed results. Moderating the council system has received harsh pushback, and the attempt at quelling revolutionary isolation in favor of building a friendly-faced socialism hand-in-hand with some moderates members of the Internationale has left a sour taste in the mouths of some. Despite this, we push on, attempting to build our revolution, our socialism, and our Germany, one step at a time."
GER_backward_south:0 "낙후된 남부"
GER_backward_south_desc:0 "Bavaria's first revolutionary impulse was killed before it could walk, the flicking flame of the Munich Council Republic was quickly quenched by the reactionary wave. To this day, Bavaria remains the undecided province - still predominately agrarian, it lacks a proletarian base loyal to the revolution. The masses there cling to the voice of the Catholic church, the solid foundation of the Bavarian social order, listening more to the priests than to social-democratic agitators.\n\nFrom this land, many conservative parties get their support - the CSABPD, who want to give socialism and democracy a Christian and moral tint, or the DSRP of Joseph Goebbels, reviving the spirits of past revolutions and romantic nationalism. While we could ask for more from these factions - they still retain a commitment to socialism and revolution. Worse than that - Bavaria is the home of several reactionary movements, such as the pan-Germanic agitators spreading from Austria or the terrorist Greens. \n\nAction needs to be taken - or the gap between the South and the rest of Germany will grow larger, until the point it may endanger the inviolability of our union."

Forged in fire, our friendship stays enduring, as together we fight against the double-headed beast of reaction in Europe. To the dismay of some nationalists, we recognized Polish borders, in return for the Poles giving up claims on Prussia - currently still occupied by imperial forces.\n\nThe pact with the Intermarium brings many economic, diplomatic and military benefits to us. Isolated by bourgeois nations, we don't starve thanks to Ukrainian wheat and run our factories with Polish coal. But most importantly - our eastern border stays secure, coming in great help as the futurist threat rises in the West ."
GER_spectre_communism:0 "공산주의의 요람"

On our soil, the great Second International, the heroic organization that still leads the proletarian struggle across the entire globe, was born. The history of socialism reaches long back to the past century - and through the entire length of it, Germany has laboured towards the workers' cause, with many small and big victories against capitalism. \n\nIn the beginning of the Great War all seemed lost - the SPD was banned and its leadership jailed, for holding true to its principles and refusing to support a bourgeois war that would spill the blood of the European proletarian. Then - as Germany was losing ground, the worst years came. The military clique that seized the government was swayed over by a madman - Erich Ludendorff - who declared a total war. On the first of May in 1918, the German people could suffer no more - and rose up beneath the red banner. Against the war and tyranny the capitalists brought on Europe. \n\nIn that moment, Germany, from the darkest hell of capitalism turned into a bright torch of the new world. Our republic glows bright with hope to the oppressed masses of all continents. The example of the German people's resistance is told in the furthest corners of the globe. Everywhere where tyranny reigns, we serve to soothe the hearts and kindle a new flame.

Never again should sons bury their fathers, never again should wives weep for their beloveds, never again should anyone be subjected to the foul trench existence. Never again a war.\n\nThose who fell to these feelings watch in horror, as many of the new generations call for another war - to finish off reaction in the East, or to destroy the Western hydra.

germany.1.desc:0 "Paul Levi sat listening to his advisors, with increasing worry. His premiership had already been precarious, overseeing the mass exodus of the left and right of his party into the KPD and ASPD respectively. That combined with his implementation of the desperately needed, yet somewhat unpopular, normalization of the revolution, both diplomatically and economically, meant that a significant part of his party were getting sick of him. And what he absolutely did not need to fix this was what his advisors were telling him:\n\n\"It's being called Red Vienna.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"With the temporary absence of the Emperor after the death of Franz Ferdinand, certain communists used the opportunity to seize Vienna, some in Prague too. We suspect that they believe we will come to their aide.\"\n\nLevi had to laugh, internally of course. Were these men mad? What did they think has changed from 15 years ago? Was Rome Red as well? Was London breaking their chains in concordance? \n\nBut Levi knew this was no laughing matter. While an invasion would be diplomatic suicide, sitting by would be political suicide. His opposition would never shut up that he had failed to \"spread the revolution\" or \"finish the German revolution\" or whatever revolutionary phraseology would suit them. \n\nBut what made Levi better than these men was his pragmatism. Come all the insults, but at the end of the day, Levi would have a revolution and they would not.\n\n\"Issue a statement of solidarity but nothing more.\""

germany.2.desc:0 "\"Comrades, I ask Chairman Levi how he could leave the Austrian working class out in the cold while the Austrian working class screamed for liberation?\"\n\nLevi sat, nervously looking out at the congress, convened in emergency over what was now labelled \"Red Week\". The whole room felt like it was on the verge of explosion. Scenes from the revolt had been published all over German media and the people were outraged, along with their representatives. Of course, he sympathised with the Austrians, but how could they expect him to risk a war with the great power for it? Germany was in no state for it, not with its barely functional army, its still recovering economy, and shattered politics. Levi sighed, knowing he'd have to answer this petulant representative.\n\n\"Comrades, I ask, are you unaware that the Austrian Empire has the backing of the Italian and British governments? Are you unaware that 'support' for these strikers would lead to war? Was our revolution not fought explicitly to eradicate war from the face of the Earth? I cannot say in good conscious that I would be willing to plunge Europe into war for the sake of revolutionary adventurists.\"\n\nWith this the congress exploded. The typical suspects from the ultra-left KPD were complaining of a lack of courage in SPD leadership. His own party seemed split between tired apathy and rocous disappointment and - oh Christ, Kautsky was shaking his head. Scattered ASPD representatives could be heard clapping, which was more indictment than praise. But the loudest protests came from the nationalists in the DSRP and SRNP. Every single one was united in their utter hatred for him, it was as if they coordinated it before entering. From Goebbels, to Niekisch, to Braun, to Wolffheim, to Paetel, all brought together in their pure, endless, and vitriolic hatred for Levi. \n\n\"If there was an ounce of justice in the world, the Austro-German proletariat would storm into this building and drag you through the street for these words\", fired one of the more moderate SRNP representatives."

germany.3.desc:0 "The paper crunched beneath Walther Bauer's weathered hands, hands of a workingman. These hands were those that built Germany, those that saved Germany, and recently, those that voted for Germany's future. Of course, Bauer had voted for the SPD. That dog Levi, a stain upon the party's name, had been removed, and the new candidate seemed quite promising. Much more promising than the others, that's for sure. Bauer laughed at the idea of electing a nationalist, regardless of how "socialist" they claim to be. It was against the spirit of the revolution, whether the DSRP had participated in the thing or not. A revisionist was much worse though, and was no laughing matter. The mere fact the ASPD had gained traction was worrisome, although Bauer did not lose sleep over a gaggle of fools with no calling.\n\nNo, what truly worried Bauer was the KPD's performance as of late, with the SPD besieged on all sides. The radicals on the left grabbing control of the state apparatus was something Bauer could not stand for, much less when done by vile splitters rejecting the party's line. With Lenin's passing, Bauer had hoped that he damnable party would just die, but it seems as though the devils escaped Hell to create it on Earth.\n\nAsh from his cigarette fell onto the headline, and Bauer's line of thought was interrupted by the sound of it hitting the paper. He shook his head, attempting to clear out his worries. His cold, tired eyes took a long gaze at the rag, reading out the name of the party that was to govern Germany for years to come, and seeing that it was..."

germany.4.t:0 "A Renewal of Vows?"
germany.4.desc:0 "Paul Levi's disgrace and the news of snap elections has led to a reassessing of strategy in all parties of the German political scene, and for the nationalist cohort, there are no exceptions. There is a surprising amount of overlap between the political organizations given the lack of a conventional right-wing nationalist party on the German political scene. At the front of the herd is the Deutsche Sozialrepublikanische Partei (DSRP), which has been the popular standard-bearer of German nationalism since its official founding in 1923, after the leadership of Heinrich Laufenberg and Fritz Wolffheim left the SPD over issues between the Hamburg-based organization and the national program of the party. However, it also draws membership from the Gruppe Sozialrevolutionärer Nationalisten (GSRN) – now the Sozialrevolutionäre Nationalpartei (SRNP) – which was founded during the German Revolution.\n\nNaturally, there is as much to disagree about in this conglomeration as there is to unite them. While a substantial portion of the DSRP's base is rural, agricultural, and amenable to the religious socialism of the CSABPD, the party as a whole is far more leftist than the SRNP, with its roots in the western and southern side of the early revolution. In contrast, the SRNP's maximalist revolutionary nationalist program attracts a more urbane and less traditional membership, as well as being de-facto the "soldiers' party" due to the origin being in the soldier councils of the eastern side during the early revolution. With German politics in flux, the DSRP leadership must ask itself some important questions about this relationship. Will continuing to work alongside the SRNP harm their chances of making a coalition with other parties? Will abandoning them put the nationalist cause in disarray? The party searches for answers..."

germany.5.t:0 "A New KPD Chairman?"
germany.5.desc:0 "With wry satisfaction, we must note the party that owes its existence to dissatisfaction with the government after Rosa Luxemburg now faces its own factional dispute after the death of a leader. While Vladimir Lenin's uncompromising course had never seen the Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands seize the levers of power, the man's revolutionary credentials and dynamism had a magnetic effect on party unity. Without the Russian exile directing things, the KPD heads to Bremen without a course already decided.\n\n  Paul Levi's party may appear strong on the otuside, yes, but the faction under Heinrich Brandler argues that opportunities hide in the seemingly united SPD. It is clear not everyone that was dissatisfied with Levi's revisionism followed us to the KPD, and many within the SPD long for a party reminded of its revolutionary principles. There are no other options. Once the SPD grows vulnerable, the KPD could use its position to leverage the Levi clique out of power... but it is unclear if Levi will make himself vulnerable soon enoug to really save Germany.\n\nUninspiring or \"realist,\" perhaps, but the Brandler faction owes some of its appeal to the brazenness of its opposition. There is another thesis advanced by Karl Radek, that the KPD can ally with other outsider parties such as the DSRP and SRNP to channel nationalist grievances of the German towards the struggle of the working class. Working with the SPD after its clear fall to pseudo-bourgeois bureacts and the bad blood of the last seven years is simply too much for many within the party and without to bear. But is working with nationalists a bridge too far? And would they receive a Polish Jew with open arms?\n\nThe future strategic picture is uncertain, but the party needs a chairman now.

Certainly, Levi's premiership had been shambolic, but the grand old man of the SPD still had gravitas beyond his station. In the structure of the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, where the party Chairman picks the Premier directly, that gravitas counted for a lot. Much speculation had been made about what he would say given the snap election, but the mechanisms of the party leadership could be opaque...\n\n\"Comrades, before we proceed to today's business, Premier Levi would like to say a few words.\"\n\nThe Chairman backed away from his podium while polite, but subdued, applause reverberated through the meeting hall. Premier Levi advanced into his place, looking for all the world more alone. One could wonder what as going through his head as his fingers found purchase on the sides. What had the past eight years been for? Could anyone have held the party together after Rosa? Was he even wrong about Austria, in the end? How did he feel about those baying for his blood even within his own party? And how-\n\n\"For the sake of the party, and the socialist state it represents, I will not be standing as the party leader in the coming election.\"\n\nMurmuring immediately became pandemonium as Levi quietly backed away and walked off-stage. Kautsky reapproached his place and found himself waiting for the roar to die down. Surely by now they must be wondering who would be named the heir apparent.

germany.7.desc:0 "The election of Heinrich Brandler as the chairman of the KPD has led to an opening of back channels between the upstart communists and the beleaguered SPD government. Though the selection of new leadership has given the party a new outlook heading into the snap elections, the coalition politics of this proletarian republic make certain conclusions inescapable. Without allies to the right in the ASPD, the SPD is going to need to look to more-revolutionary parties to form a government and polish their credentials as socialists. Chairman Brandler has proven amenable to being realistic in his demands. The option is open for the SPD to make a show of cooperation - perhaps in the neutral town of Weimar - and hammer out an agreement to reduce the amount of campaigning against each other, then start making plans for the future in government.\n\nBut of course, some of the party's right wing, who were mostly the architects of Levi's domestic policy, find the prospect of governing with the KPD unpalatable. The hope is that the disorganization of other potential coalitions will allow the SPD to come out of the election with a commanding plurality (or, some optimists contend, a majority) and be able to form a coalition after the fact by badgering the lesser parties into being realistic.\n\nAnd so, we must decide: to humor the KPD or not?"

That sly old devil, time, simply would not allow it. But he had finally been able to pencil in a visit, courtesy of the new statue erected, a statue of Richard Flisges.\n\nYet the statue was not the monument Goebbels stood by right now, rather, it was Flisges' grave. He had died in the revolution, died side by side with Goebbels himself. The two of them stood defending Bonn against the forces of reaction like dykes in the sea, vanguards against the flood. It was in honor of Flisges that Goebbels had begun his new programme, the eponymous Flisgesjugend. This way, a new generation would learn from his memory. The youth would become heroes of their own.\n\nA tear fell onto the soil infront of the cross under which Flisges was buried. Goebbels wiped his face with his clenched fist, holding a gift for the departed. He set it down, upon the forgotten memory of his hero. His best friend. He grasped his cane and set off, ignoring the newly formed tears. As he walked back from the cemetery, the rose still fresh on the dirt, Goebbels whispered a word to his friend in Heaven:"

germany.12.desc:0 "Berlin. Tiergarten. The streets infront of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft lay barren of dust, the boots of students having whisked it away from constant marches infront of it. Tonight seemed to be home to another, but there was something in the air that felt different. Something electric. A few researchers stood outside the facility, eyes open. Looking. Scanning. Analyzing every detail. They had dealt with enough disruptions to their work, enough violence and street fanfare. Tonight they would push back. Tonight they would take a stand. But tonight was a poor choice of timing.\n\nHundreds of uniformed youth begun to show up, some barely in their teens. At the front, a red banner emblazoned with gold: \"Life, Liberty, Revolution.\" The Flisgesjugend had arrived. The researchers shivered, and beneath the footsteps and howls one could possibly make out a whisper asking how many had shown up this time. They had grown accustomed to the protests, the cries of \"Anti-life!\" and how they were \"subjugating love to labcoat tyranny.\" They knew they would march past this dry street, attempt to scare them into shutting down. But tonight, they would take no more of it.\n\nTonight, the march stopped. The researchers did not expect this. Slowly, as more and more youth piled and packed into the street, the march became a mob. A wolfpack. The voice of the crowd began to increase, shouts growing louder and louder. The researchers told them to leave, began shouting back, until one of them was silenced with a brick. This wasn't supposed to happen. This had never happened before.\n\nAt the sight of blood drawn by their cement comrade, the young wolverines cheered. Soon after him followed his brothers, stones and rocks pelting their enemies into submission. Walls, windows, flesh, all were valid targets, all counterrevolutionary. All were targets. But hurling pebbles was not the purpose of the night. No, tonight was celebratory. Tonight was special. For tonight, Berlin would be blessed by the holy, cleansing flame.\n\nBottles of gasoline, lit and transformed into a modern spectacle, their very own Walpurgisnacht. The Institute's books and research caught alight, offered up in the name of life itself. The heat and smoke blessed the youth, and from their mouths poured joy. Poured victory. The street became a celebration, a defiant rejection of all that the Institute stood for. A rejection of cold science, a celebration of warm life. Dancing, singing, lips pressed against eachother without regard for sex. Adam and Eve and everything inbetween, all joined together in the ritual burnt sacrifice to the god of life, the end of a stagnant old Germany, and the birth of a new one."

germany.14.desc:0 "Sudden news fell like a bolt from heaven, as word spread that many activists of the SRNP and DSRP had been arrested. The reason? The Old Social Democratic party of Germany had recently enacted controversial laws... which did not ban the SRNP and DSRP and other radical and nationalist parties, but rather, forbade the use of uniforms during public gatherings. This has been met with accusations of an attempt to introduce a social-liberal dictatorship in Germany and a disturbance of the democratic order. Popper, however, reassured the Germans with a short radio speech delivered throughout the country.\n\n\"Should a tolerant society tolerate intolerance? Should we allow radicals who believe in persecuting certain groups because of their religion, culture, race or ethnicity because we believe in political pluralism? The answer is no! We do not need to tolerate them to be tolerant. It is a paradox, but unlimited tolerance can lead to the extinction of humanism, liberalism and tolerance. When we extend our tolerance to those who are openly intolerant, we give them a chance to destroy our humanist society and tolerance with it. Any movement that preaches violence and exclusiveness must be outside the law. To show our good intentions, we have only limited the formation of groups that could threaten our democracy, rather than removing certain parties from our system because they have different views. If the parties that have used these now-banned techniques are able to adapt to the new realities, they will be able to exist as democracy should be only for democrats.\"\n\nJoseph Goebbels, despite Popper's assurances of noble intentions, has stated that this is an active and conscious attack on the nationalist opposition, especially publicising his dissatisfaction by using legal forms of propaganda. However, most of the people did not view this as any real evidence of the ASPD's willingness to destroy the nationalist parties, but only extraordinary claims without any basis. Apart from the electorate of these parties, few people cared about these angry shouts. Some even decided that it would be better when no one talked about the need to remove the Jews, the greater Germany, or disturbed the quiet day with their marches in colourful leotards.\n\nBut the nationalists, in their irritation, took to the streets to protest the changes. These protests were swiftly met with police response and arrests, with wagon after wagon of uniformed men being carted away. Among those arrested was the controversial general Ernst Röhm, who is currently awaiting a sentence for organising militias and wearing party dress in a public place. Experts believe this is a method to strip these movements of the aesthetics and propaganda that draws voters to the radicals. Among the restrictions were also other methods of limiting the influence of nationalist parties such as banning the use of sharp language during speeches, prohibition of disturbing work with speeches, and a ban on non-authorised student unions. The voices of the nationalists have slowly begun to fall silent, and as the Germans return to their peaceful Status Quo, these intolerant radicals will risk dying out at some point due to lack of support."

There it was, front page of Vorwärts. \"Lenin Dead!\" and good riddance too! Splitters, the whole lot of them, putting everything he had worked for at risk. He took a long, well deserved drag from his smoke stick, letting the cloud fill his lungs as memories filled his head.\n\nBauer had never been the \"revolutionary\" type, if such a thing truly existed. He was, as his name suggested, a farmer, like his father before him, and his father before him, and so on and so forth. His grandfather, Siegfried Bauer, had taken part in the Social Revolutions of 1848, but over time his sword became a plowshare, tilling the Bavarian soil. With time, Walther too had become a father, although he was no longer a farmer. When Ludendorff began tightening his grip on the south, Walther took up his plowshare and joined the people, if nothing more than to defend his homeland, faith, and family.\n\nWith the revolution won and the SPD secure, Walther and his family soon moved to the city, as part of \"Proletarianization\" efforts by Liebknecht and the party to modernize the German countryside. Yet time passed, and Liebknecht stepped down, citing old age. Soon after, Luxemburg herself died, replaced by Karl Kautsky. This was apparently the straw that broke Lenin's back, and with one fell swoop broke from the party, founding his own sectarian group, just like the Protestants of old. Walther couldn't believe the fool, ready to turn his back on the party of the revolution, and for what? So they could reverse the efforts that had brought modern life to Walther's family? So they could turn back the clock and slow down socialism?\n\nWalther let the smoke blow out of his lungs. Yes, the SPD had begun moving in a strange direction lately. Premier Levi's reforms seemed misguided, but he still upheld the spirit of the revolution after all. The party was the one of Luxemburg, of Liebknecht, but not of Lenin, not a party of dogmatic fools! He shook his head, clearing his thoughts before he could get too upset.\n\nWalther checked his watch. Break time was over. With a sigh, he put his cigarette out on Lenin's face, then threw the two into the trash. As he walked back into the ironwork, his mind went one last time back to Lenin, to the man who wanted to take away the new life given to him by the SPD.

At the same time, some cadres of the DSRP have likewise denounced the KPD in turn, thinking the power sharing scheme is far too generous to their senior party.\n\nHowever, a few days ago we successfully managed to forge an unbreakable bond with the DSRP via a meeting of KPD and DSRP representatives in Bremen. Rousing speeches on both sides were heard, but most importantly there was a direct discussion between even Radek and Goebbels.\n\nAfter hours of discourse a mutual understanding was established. Radek acknowledged the importance of nationality and affirmed that the SPD's ignorance of the German nation was one of its many weaknesses. Goebbels also found common ground with Radek's belief that the executive needed to be made more firm and resolute to preserve the German revolution\n\nAfter the meeting concluded, DSRP and KPD policy makers met and, after a week of negotiation, published a joint manifesto:"

Jonas entered class, his teacher meeting him with a glare for his tardiness. \n\nThe first lesson was a boring maths lesson with old Frau Schnidtke, who had always annoyed him with her laborious tone of voice and aggressive nature. He was somewhat surprised and relieved when the school janitor entered the classroom in the middle of a lesson, interrupting Frau Schnidtke, to her visible annoyance. All the children liked him, and he would often bring sweets to school, so they naturally had no issue directing their attention to him. He twirled his grey moustache and leaned against the desk as he spoke. \n\n\"Hello! Come on, come on. Come to the desk.\" \n\nThe children quickly came closer, interested in this unusual change. The janitor was silent for a moment and then continued. \n\n\"I don't know if your parents told you about the recent changes, but I will be teaching you practical professions. Not metallurgy, although we will go on a trip to the steelworks in the future, but carpentry, at least for now. Don't be afraid of the tools of the working man, everything will be explained to you.\" \n\nThe janitor and class left the room, with Frau Schnidtke's lesson unfinished, and headed to the school shed where the janitor pulled out hammers and nails, as well as chisels and a planer. He handed them out to the children and little Jonas eagerly took the first spot in line. \n\n\"Today you will learn how to build bird feeders - that will be a good start for you.\" \n\nThey went out to the yard where everyone had a prepared place and started putting together the feeders. The janitor helped guide the students, but left the labour to them. Jonas built his feeder the fastest, and the old janitor patted him on the shoulder, saying. \n\n\"Outstanding job, comrade! This is an excellent bird feeder.\" \n\n\"Thank you Mister...\", Jonas began before realising he didn't know his last name and blushed in embarrassment. \n\n\"There is no need for misters and sirs, Jonas. We are all comrades in this school. Call me Frank\" \n\n\"Thank you Frank!\", Jonas beamed \n\nWhen everyone had assembled their birdhouses, Frank brought out a ladder, put it on a tree and began to hang the feeders, pouring seeds into them. After that, he came down and gave everyone marks as well as some candies for everyone. Jonas got an extra bunch in secret.

A man running out of time in the new Germany they were building. Perhaps him being an old KPD stalwart kept the guards outside from immediately detaining him? An oversight on their part, but understandable. \n\nThe interloper continued on, reading off the text from some new pamphlet the party was about to publish. \"‘Decisively throw out the Brandlerite anti-party clique'? Karl, you know I'm committed to this party. I was there with you and Lenin when it was founded!

Then the Premier leaned forward in his seat, looking at the man before him over his glasses, and continued, deliberately and evenly. \n\n\"Comrade, your record of service to the party and revolution is indeed commendable. It took determination to leave the SPD to wander into the void, as it were, back then. Which is why it is so worrying that your will flagged at a most crucial period.\" \n\nBrandler's face began to turn red, but he remained silent as he surely realized what was coming.

With the future of Germany, marching onward without him. \"Then I shall leave on my own terms.\" \n\n\"Goodbye, Comrade Brandler.\""

Surely, he had spent years reading and debating on revolutionary subjects with his fellow revolutionary subjects. Was he fit? Physically, yes. Elias was a regular at his gymnasium; he was in such a soldier's mind that he would practise sprinting across fields. Ideologically, he felt stuck between the cringeworthy libertarian socialists and the peasant-loving nationalists, and thus considered a time-weathered organisation serving the sensible Radek a good political home. He had to wonder, though, if the expropriation of his grandfather's shoe factory would leave a stain on his record. \n\nFearing the worst but growing in certainty of his duty, Elias marched right up to the office, staring at its bold red letters above the entrance before- BOOM! The door opened into his face, knocking him on his butt. Three burly men stepped out, one extending a hand to help him up. \n\n\"Sorry lad, the glass is tinted.\" \n\nThey walked off, looking determined, with truncheons in hand. Elias gulped and stepped inside. The man at the front desk looked more like one of the Kaiser's dull clerks than an agent of revolution. They talked through the specifications of the training Elias would undergo and the examinations he would receive in a stern and abrupt manner. At one point Elias made the mistake of cracking a joke, something about how boot camp was probably not as uncomfortable as clogs camp, and was received with an over-the-glasses stare that made him realise something. This man was a former employee of his grandfather. Elias's heart began beating very fast, the man sat back and looked deep into him. \n\n\"Are you ready to give the whole of your body and spirit to the revolution?\" \n\n\"Yes, Sir!\""

germany.53.desc:0 "It was late, around midnight. The only thing that illuminated the glade was the starry sky, now covered all in the dark clouds and the flame of torches held by tall young men. All this during one of the greatest storms of recent times. During such a storm, God Thor revealed himself most powerfully in all his might. Among those gathered there were both young and old, men and women, young men and children - all dressed in beautiful folk costumes. At the head of the meeting, however, one man came out, his majestic grey beard reaching his chest. His face was veiled under a hood, on which the skull of some animal was placed. As he could not see, he was leaning on a wooden cane so as not to fall. At last, however, he stretched his hand out in front of him as if he had experienced a mystical sensation, and said in a thunderous solemn voice. \n\n\"We have gathered in the sacred swamps to honour our god of vitality and thunder - Thor. Our Lord still looks on us with a furious look for our betrayal when we abandoned the faith of our ancestors in favor of a Jew on a stick and his whore mother. How will we pay off our debts towards our ancestors if not by offering it our earthly possessions?\" \n\nHe gestured with his hand to bring the artifact needed for the ritual. And no on cue, the young men carried the box on their shoulders, carrying it on a specially made litter. They could not touch her directly, as only a priest could do so or it would be an insult to the goddess. It was beautifully decorated because many ancient Germanic runes were carved on it. The priest of Thor  walked over to it, leaned over and said silently a few prayers, then opened her and turned back to the faithful, spreading his arms and taking his cane under his arm. \"Give up the formations of the ungodly capitalism which has brought degeneration and destruction to our country. Let our ancestors and gods be satisfied!\" \n\nAfter that, songs were sung in praise of the fertility mother and people were lined up. Generations of Germans, one by one, threw everyday items and luxury goods into the chest - crucifixes, food, cigarettes, books and other items that could be considered earthly. When the box was full the priest closed it and they all marched to the shore where the box was packed again into a litter. \n\n\"This litter will transport our belongings that we donated to our Lord to his domain where his kingdom is located. But his kingdom and power is not of this world, but is part of a larger and more wonderful world of spirit.\" \n\nSaid the priest as he looked over the young man picking up a litter and taking it on their shoulders and slowly bending under the weight of the chest, they started to head towards the mountain on which Thor's altar was located. It was not an easy task as the mud was all-encompassing and one careless step could mean a broken neck. The men carefully placed the litter on the altar and the priest threaded a long iron bar into the chest, several metres long. This was to draw Thunderer's attention to the gifts the people had given him. The people, the young men, and the priest watched the box as they waited for the coming of God. In the end, one thunder hit the chest and set it on fire to the accompaniment of the joyful laughs and singing of the Germans."

The Old Social Democratic party of Germany had recently enacted controversial laws... which did not ban the SRNP and DSRP and other radical and nationalist parties, but rather, forbade the use of uniforms during public gatherings. This has been met with accusations of an attempt to introduce a social-liberal dictatorship in Germany and a disturbance of the democratic order. Popper, however, reassured the Germans with a short radio speech delivered throughout the country.\n\n\"Should a tolerant society tolerate intolerance? Should we allow radicals who believe in persecuting certain groups because of their religion, culture, race or ethnicity because we believe in political pluralism? The answer is no! We do not need to tolerate them to be tolerant. It is a paradox, but unlimited tolerance can lead to the extinction of humanism, liberalism and tolerance. When we extend our tolerance to those who are openly intolerant, we give them a chance to destroy our humanist society and tolerance with it. Any movement that preaches violence and exclusiveness must be outside the law. To show our good intentions, we have only limited the formation of groups that could threaten our democracy, rather than removing certain parties from our system because they have different views. If the parties that have used these now-banned techniques are able to adapt to the new realities, they will be able to exist as democracy should be only for democrats.\"\n\nJoseph Goebbels, despite Popper's assurances of noble intentions, has stated that this is an active and conscious attack on the nationalist opposition, especially publicising his dissatisfaction by using legal forms of propaganda. However, most of the people did not view this as any real evidence of the ASPD's willingness to destroy the nationalist parties, but only extraordinary claims without any basis. Apart from the electorate of these parties, few people cared about these angry shouts. Some even decided that it would be better when no one talked about the need to remove the Jews, the greater Germany, or disturbed the quiet day with their marches in colourful leotards.\n\nBut the nationalists, in their irritation, took to the streets to protest the changes. These protests were swiftly met with police response and arrests, with wagon after wagon of uniformed men being carted away. Among those arrested was the controversial general Ernst Röhm, who is currently awaiting a sentence for organising militias and wearing party dress in a public place. Experts believe this is a method to strip these movements of the aesthetics and propaganda that draws voters to the radicals. Among the restrictions were also other methods of limiting the influence of nationalist parties such as banning the use of sharp language during speeches, prohibition of disturbing work with speeches, and a ban on non-authorised student unions. The voices of the nationalists have slowly begun to fall silent, and as the Germans return to their peaceful Status Quo, these intolerant radicals will risk dying out at some point due to lack of support."

However, Viennese repression of Czech nationalism and socialism has left us with a lack of pre-existing power structures to use for our own ends. Where Czech socialism exists, it has mostly been deep underground or in exile in Germany and Hungary, and increased White German settlement during the interwar is another major challenge they will face. In light of the circumstances, we have narrowed down our list of heads of state to five candidates. \n\nThe first, Václav Bolen, is an old hand of the Czech communist movement. He has always been on the most revolutionary fringe of the movement, and because of this he has been sheltering in Hungary, where he became an early convert to Leninism. Faced with a diluted and abused Czech national consciousness, Bolen does not necessarily advocate for the expulsion of Germans, but has indicated that a drawing of internal borders and ethnic autonomies will be necessary to revive the revolutionary core of his people. \n\nOn the other side, Bohuslav Vrbenský is a former dentist and student activist who fell in with the anarchist and socialist movements before the Great War, even being a founding member of the Federation of Czech Anarchists. Though he had a major presence in parliamentary socialist parties, persecution in the wake of the March Actions forced him underground. Largely, Vrbenský seeks to blend his two ideological influences into a program that will take production out of the hands of the state and into the hands of workers and unions. \n\nJiří Stříbrný is the third to come to mind, and a long-time socialist and nationalist politician and newspaper editor. Being on the losing side of many socialist factional disputes, he would also advocate for non-Marxist socialism and corporatist economics for a time before publicly retiring from politics to avoid state persecution. While he is certainly opportunistic, Stříbrný is a self-described Social Republican with some pre-existing influence he can call upon outside of the socialist community. \n\nFourth, Josef Patejdl is in the odd position of being the preeminent left-wing member of the old Czechoslovak Legion. The former lawyer turned exile soldier had his hopes dashed by the failure of the Czechoslovak independence movement at the end of the Great War, and his increasing alignment with socialism led to him sheltering in Germany rather than a hostile Russia. Though not necessarily a committed Spartakist, his patriotic credentials make him a unifying figure for a transitional state. \n\nOf course, another option exists, if we were so inclined to break from our orthodoxy. Jaroslav Hašek has had a messy journey across the ideological spectrum as well as the continent of Europe itself. The Bohemian-in-both-senses novelist has had a dramatic arc, from founding the parodical \"Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law,\" to becoming a left-wing Czech Legionnaire in Russia who would flee to Germany with Patejdl at the conclusion of the Great War. Ideologically, he is something of a wildcard, having gone from anarchism to socialism and back to anarchism during his time as an exile political organiser. Perhaps he deserves his turn?"

None in [Root.Capital.GetName] could say that he does not deserve a spot at the top.\n\nOn the other hand, the ever-popular Carlo Rosselli could serve to bring unity to a land historically wracked with instability.

germany.27.desc:0 "The French Section Of The Workers' Internationale has been in perpetual decline since the fateful Union Sacrée of 1913. Enduring a brutal civil war in 1917, eight years of repression under Action Française, and now with the Artaudist coup of 1934, the idea that France's government represents its proletariat is a mere joke, and a bad one at that. For our 20th congress, we must finally address the French Question.\n\nThe current bodies of representation are not in touch with the French Proletariat, nor could they be, due to the repressive nature of French authorities. This has produced an epidemic of careerists without any vision, propelled further solely to continue the status quo. In light of this, the congress has decided to dissolve the walking husk of the SFIO, and voted to replace it with the Comité National de la France Libre, a new body representing France. Since it does not represent the French proletariat directly, but only its interests, it lacks the old SFIO's input in our congress. Furthermore, as it lacks connection to the proletariat in France, it will composed of the second best thing: French exiles in Germany. They have poured into our country over the years and they are our best insight into French nation.\n\nThe first task of the Committee will be to elect a chairperson. This will establish the tone of the body moving forward. Four people have come to the front as choices.\n\nThe first candidate is Marcel Déat: a hangover from the old careerists, he still holds sway in the congress. He proposes that France is fundamentally broken on a national level and requires an outside force to impose revolution from the top down, what he has labelled \"the constructive revolution\".\n\n The second candidate is Abbé Pierre, who fled France in 1934 after being attacked by anti-clericalists. He believes that France requires a moral more than political revival, and that this revival should be achieved through Christian love and charity. Many Catholics who were chased out of France during the Artaud coup are emphatic supporters.\n\nThe third candidate, Simone Weil, is an unusual attendant to the Second Internationale which has usually barred anarchists. But since the committee is technically not representatives of the proletariat directly but instead representative of the nation as a whole, she has been allowed to run. A socialist since age six, Weil has traveled all around Europe to aid the revolutionary cause. Despite her anarchism, she is also a devout Christian with mystical tendencies.\n\nThe final candidate, Louis-Robert Pelletier, fled France during the AF years. He asserts a controversial thesis that the AF government was a direct continuation of Roman rule, derisively calling Maurras another Caesar. He has said that the French proletariat tends to be of Celtic stock while the French bourgeoisie tends to be Roman. Naturally, he is controversial for a seeming sympathy to medievalism and a tendency towards racialism, even if in service to socialism.\n\nThe committee is divided between the four so we must step in to break the dead-lock."

Eventually, however, the march was over, and Joseph Goebbels came out onstage to deliver his long-awaited speech. Behind him stood a towering mass, hidden beneath canvas. The suspense of what awaited under the cloth sent electric shivers throughout the crowd. \n\n\"Dear brothers and sisters of the proletariat! I stand before you, not as one who dictates, but as your humble servant. There are far greater men than me who have led the German people, and today, I wish to speak on one of them. A man of great heart and great will who fought not only for a free Germany, but a free Europe as well, and for the freedom of American slaves. Freedom was the supreme value in his life, not a selfish freedom for himself, but an unbound freedom for the whole world.\" \n\n\"It is terrible that this man has been forgotten for so long. No orders, no praise, no remembrance. This is terrible! A terrible mistake that was the fault of both Bismark's Reich, and of the SPD's Reich, two regimes not too different from one another. I stand here before you today in order to correct this mistake, so that both our ancestors and future generations can forgive us! Therefore, I announce that from today onwards the Theaterplatz will be called the Friedrich-Heckerplatz! This square will be decorated with a unique Hecker memorial! To show that Hecker has not been forgotten, and that the efforts of the hideous Prussian tyranny have been completely ineffective! Today, we will show the world that Hecker is alive forever!\"\n\nThe soldiers standing behind Goebbels released the canvas, unveiling a giant brass statue of Friedrich Hecker. He stared proudly into the distance, admiring the majesty of Frankfurt. To this, the crowd began clapping and cheering. Fireworks soared into the sky, forming a beautiful black-red-gold colour that stood over the monument for long after the speech was finished.

While restoring national symbols and reinvigorating the youth may be flashy, he knew it would be the changing of the structure of the republic which would be his great legacy. The arcane and chaotic way Germany had been run up until this point would destroy it given enough time. And Goebbels would go down in history for correcting all the errors of the young republic, he just knew it. With a heave, Goebbels lifted himself from his seat, and took his place at the centre podium. \n\n\"Friends, Comrades, Germans. Our beautiful fatherland faces a choice today. A choice between Bakuninist chaos and socialist order. A choice between strength and weakness. A choice between capriciousness and justice. Our current system was built on necessary and beautiful revolt, but the contingency and chance of revolt has no place in governing a republic forever. The systems set up to coordinate revolting citizens have no right to govern a stable republic. I am talking about the taboo of the republic, the Councils.\" \n\nThe Rätekongress tore itself apart in furor at the very mention of the word, with half of the assembled calling for the Premier's head, and the other half beating them back. It had been known that Goebbels had promised sweeping changes, but to touch the foundation of the republican system seemed absurd. Goebbels patiently awaited for the chamber to quiet, but as the cacophony only grew louder, he cut short the shrieks with a series of quick raps from his cane to the hardwood floor. \n\n\"While it may have seemed natural for those coming out of the Wilhelmine state to limit voting in the opposite direction as it stood before, giving only the worker in his workplace a voice, this was, and is, a monumental mistake. It is understandable why this mistake was made, as the SPD's combination of dogmatic and misunderstood Marxism confused the Dictatorship of the Proletariat as an administrative rather than as a political entity, as it is properly understood. And of course, there was the mistaken concept that the highest phase of social development would be stateless, meaning that any injustice in the current system would naturally fade with time.  But this is nothing but anarchism, antithetical to Marx! The state is a critical entity, it binds the nation, its institutions create positive freedom, and it enforces justice and law. The state shouldn't be destroyed, but perfected! And the first step is to introduce the principle of one citizen one vote! As such I am calling for a convention to write a new constitution for a stable republican future. One that is worthy of a grand German republic\" \n\nTo the SPD representatives's horror, due to careful coalitional work Goebbels was able to get enough representatives to agree to a new convention to reorder the republic."

Analyzing every detail. They had dealt with enough disruptions to their work, enough violence and street fanfare. Tonight they would push back. Tonight they would take a stand. But tonight was a poor choice of timing. \n\nHundreds of uniformed youth begun to show up, some barely in their teens. At the front, a red banner emblazoned with gold: \"Life, Liberty, Revolution.\" The Flisgesjugend had arrived. The researchers shivered, and beneath the footsteps and howls one could possibly make out a whisper asking how many had shown up this time. They had grown accustomed to the protests, the cries of \"Anti-life!\" and how they were \"subjugating love to labcoat tyranny.\" They knew they would march past this dry street, attempt to scare them into shutting down. But tonight, they would take no more of it. \n\nTonight, the march stopped. The researchers did not expect this. Slowly, as more and more youth piled and packed into the street, the march became a mob. A wolfpack. The voice of the crowd began to increase, shouts growing louder and louder. The researchers told them to leave, began shouting back, until one of them was silenced with a brick. This wasn't supposed to happen. This had never happened before. \n\nAt the sight of blood drawn by their cement comrade, the young wolverines cheered. Soon after him followed his brothers, stones and rocks pelting their enemies into submission. Walls, windows, flesh, all were valid targets, all counterrevolutionary. All were targets. But hurling pebbles was not the purpose of the night. No, tonight was celebratory. Tonight was special. For tonight, Berlin would be blessed by the holy, cleansing flame. \n\nBottles of gasoline, lit and transformed into a modern spectacle, their very own Walpurgisnacht. The Institute's books and research caught alight, offered up in the name of life itself. The heat and smoke blessed the youth, and from their mouths poured joy. Poured victory. The street became a celebration, a defiant rejection of all that the Institute stood for. A rejection of cold science, a celebration of warm life. Dancing, singing, lips pressed against eachother without regard for sex. Adam and Eve and everything inbetween, all joined together in the ritual burnt sacrifice to the god of life, the end of a stagnant old Germany, and the birth of a new one."

GER_spreadtherevolution_desc:0 "Brothers and sisters in work! We are faced with an unimaginably great task! Our revolution is lurking everywhere from the demons of ultramodernism, the reactionaries and the bourgeoisie! We cannot be apathetic to recent events not only in Europe but also in the world, but we must establish a hard vanguard in all corners of our globe. Helping brotherly nations break free from the chains of oppression will allow us to cooperate with them more deeply, which will result in gaining the allies we need so much currently. So I will ask you a question. From East to West, from Pole to Pole, you can hear the voice of the workers who await their liberation! Will you listen to him and do your duty or will you ignore him and perish?"
GER_austrian_situation:0 "The Austrian Situation"
GER_austrian_situation_desc:0 "What we found in the south puts us in a difficult position. Levi's apathy has led the Austrian working people not to believe in our sincere intentions and the most passionate revolutionaries to rot in prisons or on the bottom of the Danube River. However, we must not despair of the past, and we must reconsider our chances against the reactionaries in Vienna. We need to mobilise and support the forces opposing the supremacy of the ultra-conservative Habsburgs. There is still a long way to go before the revolution in southern Germany, but we hope that, thanks to their joint efforts, the thought of Marx, Luxemburg, Kautsky and Bernstein will be able to spill like a red flood not only on the Alps but all over Europe."
GER_pangermanic_rhetoric:0 "The Pan-German Thesis"
GER_pangermanic_rhetoric_desc:0 "Pan-Germanism. The concept of the unity of a nation that exists in multiple states. Utterances of such a word are usually followed, unfortunately, by connotations of nationalist chauvinists who would love nothing more than the annihilation of the working class's will. But we must not forget where this idea first came! It was in 1848, in the streets of German cities, led by the rallying cries of revolutionaries that the working class first rose up against feudal barons, carrying flags that declared undying support for the unity of a German nation that went from the peaks of the Alps to the coast of the North Sea! \n\nLet us now reclaim this ideology, and place it in the hands of the working man once more! Let us use it against the reactionary despots in Austria and forge a new and united Germany, unspoiled by arbitrary borders!"
GER_prison_house_thesis:0 "The Prison House thesis"
GER_prison_house_thesis_desc:0 "One of our plans to contaminate the reactionary southern threat would be to stir up the minorities inside Austria and to consolidate our relations with Yugoslavia. This will anger the more national-radical forces in our policy, but at the same time it guarantees us the certainty that we will not be alone in this conflict, but that we will have companions and faithful friends who will help us stab the black heart of the reaction. Our main target is the Slavs as they are the largest minority group in Austria. Additionally, Belgrade will certainly be pleased with the support of Yugoslavism, with whom we will be able to plan a joint operation against Austria. The Czechs, on the other hand, have shown their willingness to cooperate with us and are also leading an unequal but heroic fight against the Austrians."
GER_utilize_the_nationalists:0 "Utilise Nationalists"
GER_utilize_the_nationalists_desc:0 "While the majority of factions and parties in Austria stand wholly opposed to the currents of Socialism, it would be wrong to think that there is no opportunity to be found among certain nationalist circles within Austria. Many are plagued with false delusions and inane conspiracies, that socialism is a plot to destroy the German nation put forth by so-called Judeo-Spartakists. If we can demonstrate to these groups that not only does Socialism not do away with nationhood, but also that is currently the only path to authentic completion of German nationhood, then we could certainly find ourselves with some very useful allies."
GER_national_personal_autonomy:0 "For National-Personal Autonomy"
GER_national_personal_autonomy_desc:0 "National-Personal Autonomy. A practice envisaged long before the embers of revolution arrived in Germany, but a relevant concept nonetheless. Otto Bauer who conceived the idea, formed it as a way of gathering the members of the same nation who were divided by artificial state borders. So that they would be organised not in terms of imagined lines on a map and territorial bodies, but rather, in a simple association of persons. The conception of a nation as a collection of lines on a map, and not a collective identity, forged together by culture and language is unfortunately very common. So, to establish this idea in the national consciousness is of paramount importance. Especially if we are to have an easier time convincing the non-german people of Austria that they are at home in the bosom of Germany."

Time, then, to set up our troops at the border and prepare more mundane things, such as operational plans and a list of more important strategic goals that will be necessary to seize. It is also time to spread our rhetoric to the Austrian land to incite the citizens of the empire to oppose the will of Vienna. It's time for the ideas to be put into practice. Reorganise the military! Give away weapons to soldiers! Prepare necessary exercises! Soon you will have to put all your passion into the coming conflict so that socialism can triumph and so will you!"

It will be composed of both revolutionary nationalists and socialists to organise the Czech opposition against Austria. Especially considering the fact that it was the Czech Marxist who attacked the Tyrant Karl Habsburg. The Czech spirit still lives among people, it only needs to be awakened and supported so that the Czechs, together with the German proletariat, could carry the holy fire of revolution to the whole world, starting from Berlin, Vienna and Prague."
GER_endorse_yugoslavism:0 "Endorse Yugoslavism"
GER_endorse_yugoslavism_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is our friend in the south, despite our differences, we have the same enemies. Yugoslavia was founded on the desire to regain Slavic lands from the oppressive hands of the Habsburgs. Yugoslavism is now flourishing thanks to the revolutionary and ultra-nationalist fervour directed against Italy. The South Slavs showed enthusiasm to defend their homeland on the fronts of the First World War and now express their willingness to tighten relations with us. We should actively support Belgrade in their endeavours, even if it is not viewed very well by Budapest. Close cooperation with Yugoslavia will not only allow us to secure ourselves against Italy, but also by promising them Slovenia, we will be able to gain their support in our fight against the Habsburgs"

After long preparations for the final move, we are finally tightened and ready to defeat the edge demon created by the decayed monarchy and free our brothers from the south. We tightened our bayonets, mobilised factories, gathered our faithful friends and comrades, and united internally partially correcting the mistake Levi made.

We must, therefore, create a plan for international diplomatic support for our Spanish comrades, as well as sending weapons to Iberia to arm them. We will also have to plan an investment in this region in the future in order to rebuild Spain as soon as possible after this conflict. It is certain that apathy is death and we must act actively, for pardoning the bourgeoisie will lead to our own death."
GER_futurism_problem:0 "The Futurist Problem"
GER_futurism_problem_desc:0 "The ideology of futurism spread throughout Europe and the whole world at the speed of light. Although we appreciate the will of the futurists to overthrow the old oppressive values, some of them rejected socialism and turned to capitalism in crisis, trying to make deals with the bourgeoisie. The capitalists began to poison their minds to show that the German Revolution was the source of the problems that affect their homelands. We need to get all these naive people out of error and hit all the liars who sow their counterfeits between them. No matter if it is because of the bourgeoisie or their own naiveté, we must not allow the eternal teaching of Marxism to be squandered by Neo-Boulangerism and some strange concepts unsatisfied in reality."
GER_save_madagascar:0 "Save Free Madagascar"
GER_save_madagascar_desc:0 "The tragic Maurras regime and its farcical successor in Artaud, have established the pseudo-state known as \"the Kingdom of Madagascar\". Although it claims to be independent, it is obvious to all that they are nothing but puppets for French-Imperial interests, a social face to its brutal exploitation. Luckily, the Malgache people did not sit idly and accept this oppression. They revolted and have fought for years to be free from the despotic kings. We must help them to save their hard fought for republic."
GER_invite_madagascar:0 "Bring Madagascar into the Fold"
GER_invite_madagascar_desc:0 "The revolution prevails in Africa, the monarchist traitors have fled, and Madagascar is red! We will bring this new republic of the people into the world revolution and build a bridge from Berlin to Antananarivo. Although it will be hard work to elevate the Malgache people to socialism out of their brutal experience of colonialism, it will be a work to celebrate. We will spare no expense to help the republic rise from the ruins that the kingdom has wrought."

GER_for_algerians:0 "For Algerian Freedom"
GER_for_algerians_desc:0 "Those running dogs of Capital in France have declared themselves to be a progressive force, racing against the reactionaries, bureaucrats and Councilists, towards a new future. But the people in the colonies of France beg to differ! After all, all that had changed in 1934 was that the slavers of Algeria, donned on a new mask. \nThose who live in Algeria, the sole remnant of colonialism in France, hope and fight for an end to exploitation and for the freedom of the Algerian nation against the chafing bonds of the Metropolitans. While not all the factions of Algeria follow a Socialist vision, it would be foolish to think that there is not an opportunity here! We have established contacts with various organisations (some Communist and some not) who were happy to hear our offers of support, especially if war was to break out between us and the French. By supplying them with weapons and the means to spread their message across the region, we will ensure that the French will have a large thorn in their side should the worst arrive."
GER_support_IRA:0 "Support Irish Socialists"
GER_support_IRA_desc:0 "The Irish Republic, a revolutionary regime fighting for freedom, has misguidedly decided to turn its back against us in support of the decadent French. While Pearse's stance has been made clear, there are many nationalists and revolutionaries under his command who share our struggle. We should approach them and let them know that shall the Emerald Isle ever break from Le Soleil's tyranny, Berlin will always have its back."
GER_comite_france_libre:0 "Comite National France Libre"
GER_comite_france_libre_desc:0 "Although France was critical to the establishment of the Second Internationale, it would be delusional to act as if everything is alright. The current French Socialists have 20 years of failure under their belt, starting with their social chauvinism, their cowardice in the face of the civil war in France, and now their inability to prevent the Artaud Dictatorship. It is clear that the current leadership of the French proletariat are inadequate and must be replaced with more capable people."

Someday the red banner will hang on the gates of the Kremlin, but now we must focus on the greater threat that is France. We cannot allow France and Russia to force us to a war on two fronts and therefore friendly relations with Warsaw are necessary. The Polish nation has fought with our people against Luddendorf and the Kaiser, and despite minor quarrels, we managed to stabilise our relations. Today, Poles and other nations of the Intermarium are preparing for a bloody battle against the Muscovites. Let's show Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Lithuanians that our support and friendship has not disappeared and we still want to support them in their holy Promethean mission."
GER_against_third_internationale:0 "Against the Third International"
GER_against_third_internationale_desc:0 "The Bolsheviks and their ridiculous theories are not that far removed from the reactionaries they wish to fight. Democratic centralism is a structure that ignores the proletariat as much as absolute monarchy. The Bolsheviks themselves departed from the socialist matrix to focus on exuberant theories that have nothing to do with the materialistic conditions of the present. What the Russian communists present is plain "Social-Futurism" and has nothing to do with the real workers movement. We must be a stronghold against this chatter and actively suppress any signs of this idiocy. Bogdanov and Mayakovsky are on a par with Tsar Nicholas II and his devil Stolypin."

GER_appease_the_bolsheviks_desc:0 "We cannot regard ourselves as some kind of inquisition that blunts all deviations from the norm. The Russian Bolsheviks, like us, want to destroy the tsarist reactionaries. We must support them with all our means. Their views are confusing and often bizarre, but they introduce many novel and original ideas that bring freshness to old decayed theories. If we want to secure our eastern flank, we cannot rely only on one card, which is Piłsudski and his legacy. We have to be hundred percent sure that our revolution and the Russian revolution will be equally secured, so it is imperative to establish lasting relations with Kavkaz and Harbin."

GER_break_cairo_to_cape:0 "Break Cape to Cairo"
GER_break_cairo_to_cape_desc:0 "Among the greatest of the colonial projects of the British Empire was the Cape to Cairo dream of that imperialist magnate Cecil Rhodes. Connecting British colonies in the Cape to the veiled protectorate in Egypt, for 45 years now, the natives of Africa have been struggling against the bonds placed on them by their colonial masters and slavers. However, with the fall of the British Raj in 1934 and the breakaway of various native nations in West and Central Africa, many had awoken to the fact that perhaps the Colonial Mammoth was not as unshakeable as once thought!\n\nNow news has emerged of an insurgent group in Tanzania led by Martin Dibobe, resisting colonial rule in the region. Dibobe had already for a long time been a staunch advocate of the rights of Africans in Germany but fled to Africa in the aftermath of the Great War. Now in Tanzania, he is rallying locals against the oppressive imperialist system imposed by the British. Obviously as a matter of principle, we ought to support Dibobe, as we would any organisation struggling against imperial aggression. But there are also deeply strategic elements to this as well. Should the revolt succeed, Britain's hold on Africa will be crippled as their holdings in the South will be divided from their holdings in Egypt. Cutting the lion even deeper..."

All across Japan, communes are being declared as workers take up arms and as disillusioned soldiers' defect to the movement of the working man! But the civil war in Japan is no forgone conclusion. There is every possibility that the imperial government will be able to strike back against the people and claw itself back from the edge of defeat. \nIn order to ensure that such a thing does not happen, it must be a priority for us to lend support and aid to the Japanese Communists to guarantee their triumph over aristocrats and monarchist despots!"

After many months of brutal and gruelling warfare, the last Imperial soldiers have surrendered, and the authority of the monarchist system has been obliterated! The empire of Japan has collapsed, and a new era begins in the East! Suggestions have been raised both in Berlin and Tokyo, that there be campaigns for cooperation via inviting German students to attend Japan, and Japanese intellectuals and students to visit Germany in turn.

However, following the end of the civil war, many thousands of Socialist workers, soldiers, and intellectuals have fled the country and seeked refuge here, hoping to form an exiled government to organise future Socialist action in Japan. These people have suffered much and to see such a strong revolutionary current go up in flames must be a great trauma indeed. Furthermore, from their experiences in war, we may well have much to learn, both in terms of military tactics and how to approach the question of revolution in the future. It is thus our duty to open our arms to all those who flee from the forces of Capital, so let us greet these exiles with open arms!"

The people shall elect their representatives directly, ensuring a government of, by, and for themselves, and not one of limp-wristed careerists and corrupt technocrats propelled through politics off the back of the proletariat. Finally, a true democracy has taken hold in Germany, the democracy of our republic, exalting the people as the power above all else in the land."

GER_capstone_of_idealism_desc:0 "Our work was predicted a long time ago – the philosopher Friedrich Schelling wrote about this in his "Introduction to the Philosophy of Mythology". It is time to recognise Marx as belonging in the broader and truly German tradition of Idealism – as a child of not only Saint-Simon, Feuerbach and Ricardo, but also of Hegel, Fichte, and Kant. The State we build, our sacred pursuit of Communism – it is not merely a caprice of some soulless mechanism – it's the ultimate material resolution of the eternal, living dialectic of History. Goebbels is going to make German Idealism real, he's going to complete the system! Before us, no one could complete the system, knowing only theory and the dust of books. Jacobi, Reinhold, Schelling, even Fichte and Hegel, none of these men could do it! But our holy labour is bringing the final destiny of the Spirit one step closer with every day, putting the maxims of the old masters into a real, material deed. Goebbels is going to complete the system - He is going to derive the complete system of German Idealism!"

As we sweep away the bureaucrats in the political field, we must not forget to aim our brush at those in the defensive field as well. Yet in doing so, we must be careful not to undermine the rights of the soldiers or bring back the Wilhelmine structure of an army, lest those so-called \"new men\" who claimed to see the truth in light of our revolution turn their coats on us and attempt to resurrect their fossil of a system."

Full power was invested without much restraint at all into the hands of the working class or, more accurately, its representatives. The universal rights protected by the system were very slim and relied on good faith to maintain. Luckily, though it is very bitter luck, Levi's government was too weak willed to abuse these gaps. But if the right person came into power, the foundations of our republic could be destroyed very quickly. We must erect iron and unbreakable rights into our constitution, to preserve a republican future even if tyrants weasel themselves into power."

Flisges was who inspired Goebbels to become the man he is today, and his sad passing during revolutionary activity was the spark that lit a beautiful flame, the very flame that illuminates all of Germany today. So let us pass this flame on to the minds of the young, moulding them in the image of Flisges to become socialist heroes, and revolutionaries against the dying age.

The act of labour is one that gives glory to God, builds our nation, strengthens the body, and fulfils the soul. Labour is the very foundation of our republic, it is what we fought, bled, and died for, what we killed for.

His unwavering and total commitment to continuing Marx's work without deviation and revision is admirable. Our party seems to have forgotten this under Levi, to its detriment.

While this \"transitional\" programme might be useful in a country where a maximum programme isn't possible, it is confusing why a socialist republic ruled by the working class would not directly pursue socialism. Let us then refute this \"transitional\" idea and create a programme more maximal than any other ever seen. It is the only programme worthy of a socialist republic."

Or he might have raised the spectre of one of the marginal parties at our flanks, but now talk of them is all but silent and the papers, councils, and dining tables are praising our progress.
