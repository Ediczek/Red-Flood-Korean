#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
POLITICS_CAROL_II_DESC:0 "카롤 2세 Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, 모든 루마니아인들의 아버지, 민족의 구원자, 루마니아 국왕, 그리고 그 외에 계속되는 칭호들. 1893년에 태어난 카롤은 언제나 논란의 인물이었습니다. Beginning with his desertion from the army duing the Great War, through two attempts to give up the rights of succession, ending with suspending the constitution and introduction of the state of emergency in 1930. 지금껏 카롤의 통치는 혼란스럽습니다. Assuming power and instantly being victim of a coup attempt, Carol was thrown into the deep water at the start, and had to learn to swim in the political currents very fast. And it seems he has succeeded, with the state slowly stabilizing after successful raids at Legionnaire cells in the country, and the FRN becoming a tad bit more united as the years pass. But Carol does not rule alone, and his government consists of the three \"constituents\" of the FRN, which are the National Liberal Party, the Democratic Nationalist Party, and perhaps the most odd of the three, the National Movement. The King also has to have all his plans voted on by the parliament, which, although it usually agrees with whatever's on the table, would not let Carol model Romania according to his will. A part of him is content with the compromise, the other - not so much, and it is up to the future to decide the fate of Romania."
POLITICS_BRATIANU_DESC:0 "Dinu Bratianu, the new-old face of the National Liberal Party. A member of the so-called \"Bratianu dynasty\", which held the PNL leadership for many years, Dinu's PNL is a return to the old, mainstream politics, that the Romanian people got accustomed to before the FRN. Running on the age-old platform of modeling the state after the Enlightened West, protectionism in trade, and liberalization of the market, he has seemingly abstained from including new things to the party program and simply reverted it to the state before Tatarescu's \"Young Liberals\" took primacy."
POLITICS_IORGA_DESC:0 "Many things can be said about the face of the Democratic Nationalist Party, but one can't call him undetermined. A Marxist in his youth, he turned to conservatism, with his self-described debut in public affairs happening in 1899 in the French-language newspaper \"L'Indépendence Roumaine\", where he published polemical articles on the activity of his fellow scholars, provoking a lengthy scandal. Iorga ran in the 1905 elections as an independent candidate and won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, attaching himself to the Conservatives in 1906. One of the more notable events involving Nicolae also happened that year, when he, in a wave of Francophobia among the young part of Romanian population, boycotted the National Theater for staging a play entirely in French. He opposed the brutal Liberal suppression of the Peasants' Revolt, and finally, in 1910 formed the Democratic Nationalist Party with A.C. Cuza, advocating for nationalism, conservatism, and economic corporatism. When the Great War broke out in 1913 and Romania was pushed into Wallachia, he issued appeals against defeatism, and when it eventually ended, he condemned the Republic in Moldova and the Socialists in Transylvania, focusing his activity on exposing collaborators. With the Conservative Party collapsing soon after the war, it was the PND that took its previous place. In 1923 Cuza left the PND following an official split with Iorga. The party itself won the elections of 1924 and 1926, and in 1930, got officially absorbed into the FRN, despite Iorga's opposition towards \"dictatorial experiments\"."
POLITICS_CANTACUZINO_DESC:0 "알렉산드리나 칸타쿠지노의 민족운동은 루마니아 정계에서 가장 새로운 발전 양상 중 하나입니다. A member of the upper class of Romania, the only to survive infancy, around 1899 she married a wealthy landowner, Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, and started claiming the title of \"Princess\". The marriage propelled Alexnadrina into high society, bringing her into contact with the elite of the Conservative Party. In 1910, she joined the National Orthodox Society of Romanian Women, which marked her debut in public affairs and nationalist politics. The SONFR included some liberal sufragettes, but Cantacuzino wasn't clearly affiliated with this current despite her self-describing herself as a \"feminist\". An ardent believer in the so-called \"historic mission of the upper classes\", she focused on assisting the socially disadvantaged as a way of serving the country and nation. During the Great War, she volunteered to work as a nurse and became a member of the Red Cross \"Ladies' Committee\", working to provide humanitarian help. She believed in the ethnic Romanian capacity for work and rejuvenation, and the SONFR itself was involved in smuggling recovering soldiers to Wallachia. After the war, she was elected as the SONFR president, negotiating its collaboration with secular women's movements, becoming a Vice President of the National Council of Romanian Women, which marked the start of her suffrage activism. Despite everything, however, she still aimed to keep the traditional family model intact. In 1930 she became the CNFR President after the protest resignation of Calypso Botez, and soon after the Legionnaire coup attempt happened. Cantacuzino, then a moderate supporter of the Legion, immediately turned away from it, and began searching something new - the answer to her question was Fiume, and so her nationalism shifted into a Fiumeanist version, adapted to Romania. In 1932, she created the National Movement, and was invited into the FRN by Carol, ready to fulfill some of her demands."

ROM_divide:0 "대분열"
ROM_divide_desc:0 "Romania, once again, is disunited. With a series of events, beginning in 1913 with the Great War, ending in 1920 with the end of the War of Union, Romania has almost entirely stopped resembling its former self. With all governments fundamentally opposed to each other, Romania can unite only by war, and unite it shall."

ROM_frn_idea_desc:0 "The Front, born in 1930, is a coalition of three groups - the National Liberal Party, the Democratic Nationalist Party, and the Natiomal Movement, with the latter only getting into the government in 1932. Operating on a suspended constitution, Carol and the FRN rule as equals, with all government policies being a collection on what the two powers can agree on."
ROM_hedonist_king:0 "향락에 젖은 왕"
ROM_hedonist_king_desc:0 "Carol has provoked his fair share of controversy, and the list gets bigger and bigger as time goes on. This has led to him rapidly losing popularity, as his hedonism depletes the State Reserves."

Our goal since the unification of the Principalities so many years ago has always been the unity of all Romanians - and we will pursue it against all odds."
