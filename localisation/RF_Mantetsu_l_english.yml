#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_YASUHITO_MAN_DESC:0 "Fallen Emperor Yasuhito is a shadow of the man he once was, his gamble has cost him is empire and his home. His people have suffered unspeakable evils, all because he was too bold and too naive to tell his generals 'no.'."
POLITICS_ITAGAKI_DESC:0 "Seishirō was born into a respectable family of samurai lineage in Northern Japan. His military career thus far has been noteworthy, and his career in China has placed him in high rank among the Kwantung Army. While Seishirō mostly disapproves of Mr. Kishi, he cannot openly endorse his enemies - such as academy friend and exile Tetsuzan Nagata - for fear of reprisals from reactionary loyalists."
POLITICS_KISHI_DESC:0 "Mr. Kishi is renowned throughout the Japanese Empire for his ability to get results, he has pushed a program of state-corporate exploitation in South Manchuria that has begun to bear fruit. He is also famously uncouth, a perverse man with little compunciton about how he treats his subordinates, women especially."
POLITICS_XUELIANG_DESC:0 "Zhang Xueliang was practically born to be a military leader, his father's illustrious career and his education in Japan, guaranteed Xueliang a place in the staff of any Northern Army. Now that the Fengtian has returned to prominence, he seeks to turn the clique towards unifying China and reconciling with the broken remains of the Guomindang to the South."
POLITICS_ZUOLIN_DESC:0 "Perhaps one of the most famous leaders of the warlord period in China, Zhang Zuolin's power had grown drastically during the 1920's. But when the Japanese tightened their grip in South Manchuria, he fell from grace, the schism in the Beiyang meant he and his men had to resort to the old ways of banditry and cross-border activities from Mongolia in order to survive. Now Zuolin seeks to repair the fragmented Beiyang Government, either through supporting a strong leader, or taking it himself."

#DECISIONS (1.5 Update)#

#EVENTS#
man.1.t:0 "Imperial Family Flees to Manchuria"
man.1.d:0 "With Revolutionary forces quickly overrunning loyalist forces, and the fall of the capital, the Imperial family has seen fit to flee the country to escape persecution at the hands of socialist forces. The governors in the former dominion of Manchuria have welcomed them, as they docked in Dalian aboard an unassuming ship. Not only do the family seek to preserve their lives, but to also form an imperial government in exile to oppose the revolution which has bloodily seized Japan."
man.1.a:0 "He who fights and runs away..."

man.2.t:0 "Northern Intervention"
man.2.d:0 ""
man.2.a:0 "Their oppression of our brothers shall end."

man.3.t:0 "Execution of Zhang"
man.3.d:0 "Among all the warlords of China, Zhang Zongchang is perhaps the most notorious. A brash - fearless even - leader, poet or sorts, womaniser and ungentlemanly figure. He was a thorn in the side of Southern warlords in the 20's before being placed under house arrest during the Beiyang's internal strife. To prevent his return to the frey, he must be put down like the dog he is. This will send a strong message to other would-be upstarts and outlaws."
man.3.a:0 "Good ridance to a mad dog."
#GMD reconciliation
man.4.t:0 "Fengtian offers reconiliation with the Nanjing Government"
man.4.d:0 "The Northern Government is extending an olive branch to us, after decades of turmoil there has been a shift towards a middle-ground in republican leadership, with concessions promised to Guomindang leaders in exchange for joining a united front against foreign and leftist elements in the country. It is a tempting offer, but could spell the end for the autonomy of our government."
man.4.a:0 "United we stand."
man.4.b:0 "They are on their own."
#MON reconciliation
man.5.t:0 "Fengtian offers reconiliation with the Anhui Clique"
man.5.d:0 "In the years since the Beiyang Government split and came to be dominated by the Shanxi, we have been cut out and isolated from China. Now the new Fengtian leadership in the Capital are proposing we rejoin the fold to strengthen their National Government and move towards unifying China once more. The question remains as to whether our membership would be a fair trade or practical submission."
man.5.a:0 "United we stand."
man.5.b:0 "They are on their own."
#GDP reconciliation
man.6.t:0 "Fengtian offers reconiliation with the Liangguang Clique"
man.6.d:0 "The Northern Government is extending an olive branch to us, after decades of turmoil there has been a shift towards a middle-ground in republican leadership, with concessions promised to Guomindang leaders in exchange for joining a united front against foreign and leftist elements in the country. It is a tempting offer, but could spell the end for the autonomy of our government."
man.6.a:0 "United we stand."
man.6.b:0 "They are on their own."
#SHA reconciliation
man.7.t:0 "Fengtian offers reconiliation with the Zhili Clique"
man.7.d:0 "The rebirth of the Fengtian Clique has bolstered support for the Zhili to rejoin the Beiyang Government. They now present a strong anti-japanese front. But there is concern that their attempts to appease and integrate the Guomindang will poison the project and doom it to failure. Regardless it is easy to see the advantage in standing together as a dominant Northern Alliance."
man.7.a:0 "United we stand."
man.7.b:0 "They are on their own."

man.8.t:0 "The White Terror"
man.8.d:0 "Seditious socialists and treacherous revolutionaries are an ever-present danger. We must take steps to quell any uprisings, guerilla factions or sympathising communities that may aid and abet radical insurrection."
man.8.a:0 "The reds will bleed."

man.9.t:0 "The Chinchow Declaration"
man.9.d:0 "Following weeks of dull meetings, hearings, testimonies and financial reports, the review has chosen not to enact radical reform. Instead the Chinchow declaration has been signed, a document affording some small concessions of maximum hours, minimum payment and conditions. But explicitly making no attempt to make industries accountable or responsible for employee welfare. The exploitation of thousands of workers in the North will continue mostly as usual, and industrialisation measures are now due to accelerate. The review found that attempts to make major changes would not only cut into vital production targets needed to meet quotas for export markets, but it would potentially enable political upheaval by validating the calls from socialist elements for major restructuring. Things will improve incrementally and the existing power structure can remain intact, in thoery everybody wins. Though obviously some will be winning far more than others, the next review will be documenting workplace deaths after all..."
man.9.a:0 "We are generous masters."

man.10.t:0 "The Exploitation Ends"
man.10.d:0 "Following weeks of dull meetings, hearings, testimonies and financial reports, the review has chosen to enact the proposed reform bills. The declaration lobby has been struck down, with several now facing criminal negligence investigations. Minimum pay and conditions, minimum and maximum weekly hours, union protections, company shares, medical insurance and more have all has official targets and standards set. An new expenditure package has been approved to pay for the new changes, and the legal battles will help bring the companies under state juridiction. Private militias are being reorganised into regional battalions and a new audit body has been established to ensure compliance with policy. Slowly, these changes will bring about a new prosperity, productivity and happiness among the people. Though some contemptible individuals maintain that this plan will bankrupt the country, their cries fall on deaf ears as progress marches on."
man.10.a:0 "The Empire's ways will never return."

man.11.t:0 "Liason in Weihaiwei"
man.11.d:0 "Weihaiwei passed on to Chinese control a few years ago, giving them partial control over the Yellow Sea. From our weakened position, we can't assert our dominance but we can strike a deal for the time until we reclaim our homeland."
man.11.a:0 "The enemy of my enemy..."

man.12.t:0 "Technocrats Purged Again"
man.12.d:0 "The arrival of the Royal Family necessitates a certain clamp-down on dissenting individuals in Manchuria, including prominent exiles from the former Tōseiha faction. Their time here has been a mixture of political imprisonment, ministeral advising, military command and hard labor. Tetsuzan Nagata particularly has lived in relative comfort for the past 2 years in Mukden, but now that it is convenient, these men will be quitely removed. It is not important where to, only that the will of the Emperor be done and that they pose no threat to his rule."
man.12.a:0 "Good ridance to bad rubbish."

man.13.t:0 "The Emperor From Japan"
man.13.d:0 "A transformation from colony to state is no easy thing to manage, especially when the former overlord is being handed the keys. The former leaders are now both deputies and leaders, they know the lay of the land and they know the existing administration. In order to smooth over this transition and give some modicum of hope and cheer to the exiles and the Emperor's closest people, a grand coronation has been arranged to make the exiled Emperor both the Regent of North China, Emperor from Japan and spiritual leader of the people."
man.13.a:0 "Emperor Yasuhito is crowned once more."

man.14.t:0 "The New Constitution"
man.14.d:0 "With the Far East reeling from the death of the Japanese Empire, the remains of his Imperial Majesty's Government have gathered in Mukden for a conference. They are to decide on the draft for a new constitution which will recognise the Japanese Emperor as sovereign of his Empire in Exile and head of state in Mantetsu. The preliminary proceedings have thus far been a debacle of bickering factions, old wounds within the army are resurfacing and the presence of certain reformist exiles have stirred tensions with the Royal Family. Yasuhito has refused to maintain his throne so long as 'the mastermind of my brother's heinous murder' Tetsuzan Nagata remains in the conference.  Should the conference decide not to eject the reformist faction (its ranks now swollen with officers and ministers from home) then there will be no choice but to allow the crown to pass to Yasuhito's brother Nobuhito. Inicdentally Nobuhito is much more amenable to the reformist platform than his brother, and is expected to accept a return to Taishō era constitutionalism."
man.14.a:0 "Do not eject the reformists, restrain the monarchy. (Technocrat Path)"
man.14.b:0 "Eject them and give the Emperor the reigns. (Absolutist Path)"

man.15.t:0 "Uneasy Peace"
man.15.d:0 "While the IJA retreats and attempts to quell the revolution, the Kwantung forces in Manchuria watch nervously as the Beiyang Armies regroup. The peace treaty covers the colony for a year but bandits an worse are still rife. Beiyang must be watched, lest they attempt to crush the colony."
man.15.a:0 "Man the border, they cannot be trusted."

man.16.t:0 "The Future of Manchuria"
man.16.d:0 "The future of Manchuria hangs in the balance, the volatile situation in the colony is deteriorating, increased Chinese military activity is building concerns of a Fengtian threat. The Japanese seek refuge from the revolution, and would see the colony maintained as a continuum of the Empire."
man.16.a:0 "Maintain Mantetsu Governorate control."
man.16.b:0 "Let the Army step in."
man.16.c:0 "Establish the North China Governorate."

man.17.t:0 "The Fengtian Clique"
man.17.d:0 "After a brief skirmish and some light encouragement at gunpoint, the Mukden garrison has surrendered to the Fengtian and the Japanese officials that did not buy their way out have been detained. The yoke is broken and Chinese rule in Manchuria is back, perhaps this time it is permanent."
man.17.a:0 "We shall rid China of the Japanese once and for all."

man.18.t:0 "Corporate Review"
man.18.d:0 "As the chamber began to fill with officers, businessmen, stakeholders, unionists, politicians and a few token workers it became clear that the review would be a mammoth task. Dozens of reports were carted into the hall in boxes stacked on trolleys. The room quickly became hot with so many people inside. Once deliberations started there was uproar. Business and political leaders were turning shades of pink arguing their case for maintaining the current economic program, the pleas of the reformists and unionists became desperate and the first day ended with little achieved but shouting. \nAs the review progressed things did begin to calm down. There were sound arguments laid out, three men were ejected from the proceedings to face criminal charges and the Nissan representatives accepted some minimum concessions on worker conditions. But the review was not over. \nThere was of course still the issue of the corporate armies, the preferential treatment of Japanese and the Government's place in future economic matters. The colonial opperation had been as much a private enterprise as it was a Japanese one. Now the situation called for a firmer hand over the companies involved. \nDeliberations continued into the following weeks until eventually a document called the Chinchow Declaration was tabled. The document was a compromised bill mandating some minor improvements but maintaining most of the status quo economically. To most it was a generous offer, to others it was a necessary step in the right direction. It passed by a three vote margin."
man.18.a:0 "Is the labor worth the bloody price?"

man.181.t:0 "Corporate Review"
man.181.d:0 "As the chamber began to fill with officers, businessmen, stakeholders, unionists, politicians and a few token workers it became clear that the review would be a mammoth task. Dozens of reports were carted into the hall in boxes stacked on trolleys. The room quickly became hot with so many people inside. Once deliberations started there was a clear parting in the room, on one side were the bored, the sleeping and angry. On the other were the animated and hopeful dreamers pursuing meaningful resolution and justice. \nThe first session ended with little deliberation completed, but it seemed that the momentum of the review was in favour of the reformers, a few uncomfortable-looking shareholders, company directors and middle-managers left in a hurry with a flushed cheeks. Thus was the pattern of the review sessions. Weeks of one side arguing their case for change, the other disinterested, angry or dismissive. But like waves on the shore erode the rocks, as sessions passed by, more and more concessions were made, investigations for criminal acts started and opposition seats left empty. \nIn the end the review came down to a vote that would be a mere formailty, with an overwhelming majority finding in favour of reform, even if some did so begrudgingly."
man.181.a:0 "A great achievement!"

man.19.t:0 "The Siege Of Mukden"
man.19.d:0 "The military takeover is complete, yet the Chinese persist. There is now a serious Fengtian force massing near Mukden, the Kwantung Army is not in position and the garrison is under-supplied. Should they take the city the colony will effectively cease to exist, Shinkyo and Chinchow are already cut off by bandits. The crisis has arrived, Mantetsu's end is nigh."
man.19.a:0 "Someone stop them!"
man.19.b:0 "Welcome home brothers."

man.20.t:0 "The Status Of The Aristocracy"
man.20.d:0 "Many of the Japanese aristocracy have sought solace and refuge in Manchuria, the problem now is whether to maintain their status. As Japanese citizens they already enjoy many privileges, but are destitute in comparison to their lavish lifestyles in the home islands. The petitions are now daily, with tithes and bribes becoming widespread. We must decide how to proceed, do we maintain the aristocracy, strip it of power but maintain special status, or eliminate their privliges altogether?"
man.20.a:0 "Maintain their position."
man.20.b:0 "Do away with these titles."
man.20.c:0 "Let them keep the titles but strip their powers."

man.21.t:0 "The Status Of The Manchus"
man.21.d:0 "There have been repeated suggestions and initiatives to involve the native Manchurians in government and military matters as a means of legitimising our rule of the region. By exaggerating ethnic tensions between the Chinese poeple's and involving the North's natives we can build a stronger base of support, but risk losing control of certain departments to nativist opposition. The alternative is far less savoury but would guarantee loyalties with an all-japanese staff. Of course the ever-present ideas of a reformist compromise linger as a potential solution, with a promotion of Manchu culutre and language ahead of Han Chinese presenting an opportunity to build a 5th column within the Chinese."
man.21.a:0 "We are cousins after all."
man.21.b:0 "They are no better than the Han."
man.21.c:0 "They are the better of the two peoples."

man.22.t:0 "The Marco Polo Bridge Incident" #usurping the BYJ
man.22.d:0 "How hard could it be to provoke a warlord into rash action? Not hard at all, it seems. The mutual distrust between Fengtian and Shanxi has resulted in a prime opportunity to instigate a coup. Through cunning and guile Fengtian troops have been permitted passage into Beijing to guard a party of officials, they arrived to settle a trade dispute, but little did they know they were part of a bigger design. Once the Fengtian entourage crossed the Marco Polo Bridge, a bomb was detonated, obviously the Shanxi had attacked Fengtian troops and officials on a diplomatic mission. Outrageous! With confusion in the Shanxi ranks, several Fengtian divisions mobilised and entered Beijing as a relief force. The ensuing fight quickly descended into a siege with the Shanxi officials as hostages. The outcome remains unclear, a war to enact vengeance could be called, or the young marshal could rally a diplomatic response and force the many bickering Beiyang Generals to abandon the Shanxi for the Fengtian. If the coup works, the Fengtian would become the dominant force in the North."
man.22.a:0 "Declare War."
man.22.b:0 "Begin the coup."

man.23.t:0 "Rebellion in Xian"
man.23.d:0 "In response to the renewed pressure against Shanxi, the Gemingjun led by Feng Yuxiang have rebelled in the hopes of linking their forces with the revolutionaries in the South. Exactly who Feng decides to pledge his allegiance to remains to be seen, but the North is once more disunited."
man.23.a:0 "May the traitors rot!"

man.24.t:0 "Prose For Dogs"
man.24.d:0 "The notorious Zhang Zongchang is once more afoot in Northern China. His house arrest in Qingdao was rudely interrupted by the tumult of the Sunset Crash and its aftermath. Now that Zuolin has recalled the Monster of Shandong to service in Shenyang, the infamous General has once more taken to his opulent lifestyle and unorthodox pastimes. Perhaps most innocuous amongst his habits is his "talent" for prose. Yet this still has managed to cause a stir, while the Old Marshal cannot read and outright refuses to learn, Zongchang's written word has been attracting attention. French observers and journalists in Shanghai have reportedly taken a liking to his works, resulting in a prominent French businessman sponsoring Zongchang's entry into an international futurist poetry duel in Le Soleil. The Russian maester of Zaum Velimir Khlebnikov is tipped to win the contest, but the exceedingly vulgar and violent nature of Zongchang and his work is turning heads. Should Zongchang win the duel it would cause much upset across the futurist world. Should he be allowed to attend?"
man.24.a:0 "What a ridiculous suggestion!"
man.24.b:0 "Fine, let him go and bother someone else for a week or two."

man.241.t:0 "A Week In Le Soleil"
man.241.d:0 "The arrival of the Dogmeat General's entourage into Le Soleil was a sight to behold, more than a dozen cars and several luggage cases brimming with who-knows-what strapped to their roofs. The General wasted no time taking in the sights and pleasures of Le Soleil with his concubines and retinue. After a tour of the city, including the new le musée d'art futuriste, he and his party occupied a theatre in the old Île de la Cité. Several party-goers reported high-level French officials enthusiastically partaking in heavy opium smoking and dancing with Zhang's women. Before long - they say - the General retired to a French brothel for the night, hiring the entire establishment for himself and his party. This typified his week.\nOn the morning of the duel he was found in a spa on the outskirts of the city, nursing a severe hangover and surrounded by French escorts.\nFor all his decadence he was surprisingly lucid during the duel itself, his uniform was pristine too, as translators scrambled to reconstruct Khlebnikov's verses into Russian, then French, then finally Chinese, Zhang stood smiling and smoking a comically large cigar.\nWhen his parry came it was brutal, efficient and yet deft. The French observers choked on their laughter, the retort which would later be titled "A severe burn" appeared to flumox Khlebnikov. Who attempted to continue combat before stammering on his final line. Zhang's reply was a killing blow - "This skinny shit is wasting time, he is but a little man with a little cock, end this parade so I can fuck some more."\n"Such a man!"\n"So powerful."\n"He pushes the boundaries with every line."\n"Velimir never stood a chance against his manhood."\nThe celebrations of his victory lasted the weekend, and quotations headlined the Le Soleil morning editions of Le Jet de Sang. By the time he set about leaving the city he had become a French celebrity. His last words before boarding his plane were "I'll be back, first I have to go kill some bastard communists at home.""
