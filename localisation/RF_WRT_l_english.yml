# Baltic Soviet Republic #
WRT_baltic_sfsr:0 "발트 소비에트 연방 사회주의 공화국"
WRT_baltic_sfsr_desc:0 "The Politburo, elected by the Grand Soviet, is the brain. While the workers are the flesh. We shall make the country dance, balancing party and state, cities and the countryside, nationality and belonging to a Baltic union. "
WRT_international_nationalism:0 "국제 \"민족주의\""
WRT_international_nationalism_desc:0 "We are a state of many nations. This harmonious order is not a contradiction, nay. It has been brought about by the strength of each and the unity of all. Russians, Estonians, Latvians, Germans, they all have something unique to offer our country whether it be in terms of the economy or military. We are multitudes of people, but we are the newest form of a single civilization of Balts which has taken many shapes across time. This nation that transcends nations may prove heroic to the workingman. Our many metals shall be fused and sharpened to a spear point, warding away enemies at our borders."
WRT_five_year_plan:0 "5개년 계획"
WRT_five_year_plan_desc:0 "A transformation is due. Our cities, our lands, will never be the same after the economic program we project into the next five years. Electricity shall straddle the country, we will command water as only God has before, and we will make steel sing as it is bent to our use."
WRT_foundation_of_ubeg:0 "ÜBEG 창설"
WRT_foundation_of_ubeg_desc:0 "This modern era demands we adopt cutting edge technologies at an ever more rapid pace. The functions of the state itself will be tangibly more expedient if we can have mass rollouts of computers. We could even focus on research into complex systems for encryption and deciphering of intercepted coded orders, and even machines which detect objects faraway by bouncing radio waves off of them. Thus we will gain an unexpected edge against our enemies."
WRT_militarization_of_economy:0 "경제군사화"
WRT_militarization_of_economy_desc:0 "Our country is still in a quite primitive phase with many living lifestyles from centuries ago, in a state of crude, rural idiocy. But no more must we be so! The present situation gives us burgeoning powers battling for ultimate supremacy, so we can give nothing less than the whole soul of the Baltic people to upcoming conflicts. New workshops will be thrown up in a matter of weeks, and our gorgeous forests will have to be trimmed back to make room for them. Better for them to be pruned than torched by invaders."
WRT_build_power_plant_on_daugava:0 "다우가바 수력발전소 건설"
WRT_build_power_plant_on_daugava_desc:0 "With modern technology we can harness rivers to give us power equal to tons of coal. Find the dimensions. Design a transformer, generator, and turbine. Then lay the concrete."
WRT_wealth_redistribution:0 "노동자들의 이익을 위한 부 재분배"
WRT_wealth_redistribution_desc:0 "Will we let our people languish as we have them build our future? Will we let the common man have little economic power and starve him of money, the blood of the modern economy? No, we will not subject our people to modern austerity. A healthy, funded public sector with vibrant dance halls and taverns will lighten the load on the state’s circus-providing functions."
WRT_continue_five_year_plan:0 "5개년 계획 지속"
WRT_continue_five_year_plan_desc:0 "Let us stay the course, so we may emerge from our struggle for self improvement as an efficient, dynamic country. A system in which the complex functions of industrial management are taken care of by an invisible infrastructure of the peoples’ bureaucracy, in which no worker is left out in the cold. That system is one we can be proud of. With the input of workers in patriotic national councils they may constantly re-inject their humanity into the otherwise mechanical work of the state."
WRT_workers_paradise:0 "노동자의 낙원"
WRT_workers_paradise_desc:0 "The revolution needs to be felt positively by the people. They cannot simply toil all their lives. Staring down the barrel of 50 years of labor is a dark prospect without guarantees of pensions and healthcare. We need to grow various state institutions to become a warm quilt and assure our common health. The people will be able to begin their own collectives with money from state banks to form small enterprises as part of our grand industrial commonwealth."
WRT_baltic_red_army:0 "발트 홍군"
WRT_baltic_red_army_desc:0 "We are a people surrounded by great nations, we must send our young men to fight at the borders to ensure the survival of our vulnerable people in the cities. Our warriors must understand their significance in securing not just abstract ideas about our sovereignty as a socialist state, but also securing their homelands and families."
WRT_baltic_german_doctrine_cooperation:0 "발트-독일 교리 협력"
WRT_baltic_german_doctrine_cooperation_desc:0 "Our army is a small, poor one, and we cannot afford to lose men and supplies in rough terrain or areas of mass combat. German military logistics will drill our auxiliary battalions to ensure minimal losses in the face of great obstacles. We will have a training camp where our German comrades shall teach our recruits techniques and tactics for conserving supply and share state of the art technology. They will be drilled in extreme cold conditions, marshes, and mountains culminating in a day when they are left alone far from camp to navigate back like true Spartan warriors."
WRT_equipment_modernization:0 "장비 근대화"
WRT_equipment_modernization_desc:0 "The ones who threaten us have great armies, they have research institutes with more funding and staff than they know what to do with. As such we must sprint ahead of them in weapons technology, supplementing both brains and brawn. We must hold dear these fearsome machines which seem to tear open reality itself in the eyes of any country boy."
WRT_patriotic_lessons:0 "애국적 교훈들"
WRT_patriotic_lessons_desc:0 "Our populace’s most severe division, which threatens to confuse our national project, is the linguistic problem. Through education, the Baltic people will be made to understand each other. This will make mobilization more efficient and improve cooperation between institutions of research and development. The materials for this education will be freshly printed books on our great nation and the red star of socialism that watches over it."
WRT_patriotic_warfare:0 "애국전쟁"
WRT_patriotic_warfare_desc:0 "Training a nation’s soldiers means ensuring the soldiers can comprehend each other. This most basic principle must be enforced through school teachers being employed at training camps and military academies for lessons on conversational and operationally relevant Estonian and Latvian. Permitting us to more easily organize and communicate with units, this initiative will make our coordination stronger and lay the groundwork for future integration of foreign red riflemen who come to our side."
WRT_our_plane_in_the_world:0 "세계 속 우리의 자리"
WRT_our_plane_in_the_world_desc:0 "Let us praise all revolutionary states for their struggle for the new world against the old! We recognize that we are a small part of a greater global, nay cosmic fight for the soul of humanity. We will serve our people by serving the common aims of our red brethren and vice versa, for no state can be truly insulated from the world. We will defend them verbally to our doubting comrades, and if need be, physically defend their flame from those who would plunge us into the dark, back into history where nations were crude and ignorant territorial dynasties."
WRT_delegation_to_third_international:0 "제3인터내셔널행 사절단"
WRT_delegation_to_third_international_desc:0 "The world seems so much larger now that we hold power. Our struggle with Avalov now seems a tad myopic. Thankfully, the people of the world have their champion in Germany, and our revolution has proven their formula to be potent and vital! Our alliance will be a moral axis against whatever atrocity grows in Russia’s womb and what aggression springs from the Intermarium."
WRT_shelter_political_refugees:0 "정치난민을 위한 쉼터"
WRT_shelter_political_refugees_desc:0 "Runaways from Russian purges, outcasts of the current political order in Germany, socialists of all types in diaspora may all seek refuge in our lands. The government will support the construction of new homes and we will truly welcome these people as no other country would. "
WRT_message_to_lithuania:0 "리투아니아를 향한 전언"
WRT_message_to_lithuania_desc:0 " While we recognize the national question should be answered through self-determination by the people in question, the time has come for us to test our strength by integrating the final Baltic state. We have resolved the contradictions of our country, ensuring domination by no single group and prosperity for all. The Lithuanian rump state ought to be a pushover and submit to its destiny as a component of a united Baltic socialist federation."
WRT_freeing_baltic_workers:0 "발트 노동자 해방"
WRT_freeing_baltic_workers_desc:0 "Let us empower the people of our newly conquered lands to rise up against the petty order that rules their lives. At every municipal level from the great cities to the rural backwaters revolutionary councils will be constituted to dole out public property and organize labor to rebuild stability and even abundance. With our country made whole and our bonds repaired we must galvanize the lands so that invaders will perish in indignant fury as they try and die in vain to capture our impenetrable line of fortresses."
