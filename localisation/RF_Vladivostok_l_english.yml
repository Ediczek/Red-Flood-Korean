TSY_city:0 "The City of Kitsch"
TSY_city_desc:0 "Some can only despair at the loss of their beloved homeland; others dry their eyes, roll up their sleeves, and get to work. While the romantics and revolutionaries sit in the forests eating pine cones and drinking rainwater, the real movers and shakers of the world are busy making sure life goes on.\n\nVladivostok was born in pain after the death of Russia, but revolutionary sentiment and Tsarist loyalism never were conducive to business; a good businessman has loyalty to only those who can line his pockets. Therefore, when the opportunity arose, the influential people of Vladivostok rose to power and announced their support for the Promethean Crusade. Soon after, they elected a wealthy industrialist, Boris Bryner, as their president.\n\nIt did not take long to see the lights turn on, as with capital unfettered, Vladivostok became a city of plastic, neon, and vice. The great equalizer, prostitution, runs rampant, as many wives — and daughters — of aristocrats had to find new work after the fall of Russia. However, they cannot complain about a lack of clients, as people from all parts of the world have flocked to Vladivostok: Chinese, Japanese, Americans, Poles, Germans, Jews, British, Russians, and God knows what else. Whiskey, rum, blow, smack, dice, cards, old, young: all that and more that can be found in the new gem of the Intermarium. The cosmopolitan citadel has quickly become a city full of criminals and self-appointed vigilantes, as Bryner's new government refuses to intervene in the private business of its guests. Yet this hands off approach is what draws the globe in, gutter trash and silver spoons alike. Old taboos and ostracisms are drowned off the coast, as the City of the World has become the home to all misunderstood eccentrics and those who drink of wine as lesser men drink life."
