#Brief history
YUG_DESC_MENU:0 "유고슬라비아는 그 존재가 기적입니다. 오스트리아-헝가리 제국의 폐허에서 서로 다른 종족들을 흡수해낸 유고슬라비아국의 충격스러운 역량은 신생국을 향한 가장 낙천적인 전망조차 뛰어넘을 정도였습니다. 범슬라브 정체성 아래 단결해 대전쟁의 불 속에서 벼려진 유고슬라비아는 여전히 그만의 운명을 선택했습니다. 비술가, 기술관료주의자, 지나간 세월들을 그리워하는 이들 중 남슬라브인들의 미래가 어디에 있을지 뉘 감히 말할 수 있겠습니까?"

ORJUNA와 제니트파가 드보르니코비치를 자신들의 보자로 추대했지만, 모두가 그의 논란의 여지가 있는 결정에 만족하는 것은 아닙니다. 최근 드보르니코비치가 자신의 권한을 강화하려는 조처를 하고 이에 따라 폭군이라는 비난을 받으면서 상황은 더욱 악화되었습니다. 그 이후로 여러 차례 숙청이 이루어졌으며 드보르니코비치가 살아남아 통치를 계속할 수 있을지는 반대파의 태도에 달려 있습니다."

Had fate been cruller to him, he may have died unknown - but perhaps God smiled upon him, with his theories finding fertile ground and his speeches soon attracting thousands of people.\n\n1931년 9월 3일, 나라의 안정을 책임지던 총리 스토야디노비치가 한 마케도니아 암살자의 손에 쓰러졌습니다. 혁명전선은 감화력 넘치는 지도자인 드보르니코비치에게 지도를 요청했고, 이를 기꺼이 받아들인 사내는 한 달이 채 지나기도 전에 잽싸게 정변을 주도했습니다. Part of the newly formed SJNK wishes he would step down after dealing with the situation, but through grit and tenacity he holds on, in spite of his controversial reforms. Focussed around "Blood and Soil”, totalitarianization and ruthless westernization, they met with concern of many - but for now his rule among the people is known by one slogan:\n\n\"하나의 보자! 하나의 인종! 하나의 유고슬라비아!\""

He was one of the leaders of the ORJUNA - Yugoslav nationalists who gained popularity through their love-hate relationship with the Carnaro Regency.\n\nThe organization's popularity allowed it to become an important member of the 1931 coup d'état, establishing itself as the armed wing of the revolution. Ironically, despite its techniques, Leontić does not postulate totalitarianism, but even liberalization of the system by weaving democratic elements and creating a Yugoslav version of the Carnaro system. There is no question of federalization, however, as it is seen as weakening the national unity that has been so heavily paid with blood. 레온티치가 신경 쓰는 것은 단 한 가지입니다.\n\n\"단결이 아니면 죽음을!\""

At the invitation of the artistic group \"Zenit\", he returned to Yugoslavia, where he began to work tirelessly within, he quickly found his place and became the political leader of the artists.\n\nAfter the 1931 coup, he quickly rose through the ranks of government. It was he who in 1933 suggested sending a legation to Sofia to propose creating a union between two countries, becoming a peacetime hero in the process.

From the beginning, Dmitrije was deeply pious, identifying with the great writer Tolstoy, and joined the Serbian army upon the breakout of the First Balkan War. After the conflict ended he left for France, meeting the works of Charles Maurras, who completely dispelled any remnants of the pacifist Tolstoyan spirit. Upon the conclusion of the Great War, he became Minister of Justice, but swiftly found himself at odds with the King, who roundly rejected his proposal for a constitution.\n\nAfter the coup Ljotić found himself in a difficult situation, forcing him to join the royalist underground and slowly creep his way back into politics. After the overthrow of Dvorniković, Leontić took a gamble - allowing Ljotić to come to power, then attempting to depose him.

His sky-blue eyes scolded all demagogues as blond hair with a few strands of white hair was covered with a dictatorial cap and the symbol of Kolovrat. His perfect Dinaric jaw kept opening and closing, criticizing the entire congregation.\n\n\"...I expect nothing from you but discipline, zeal and more discipline! It is inconceivable that you wish to stop at our revolutionary task. We should continue our work not only for our benefit, but for all Slavic brothers! When did the ruin of Yugoslavia begin? It happened when the Italians and Austrians poisoned our souls and broke us. Therefore, it is unacceptable that this situation should repeat itself. I am not saying these words because I want to punish you, but they are words of caution to you, because among you there are false prophets who want to destroy us and our nation by resurrecting reactionary beliefs of magic and peasantness and tribalism nationalism by destroying the dinaric race. Don't be fooled by them because otherwise our national revolution will wipe you off the face of the earth!\"\n\nThe hall was filled with outstretched hands in the Roman salute and with shouts of \"드보르니코비치 만세!\" when Vođz Vladimir Dvorniković was slowly coming down from the podium. Despite the words of praise and gestures of respect, not everyone was satisfied with Vođz's bold speech. Miloš Crnjanski straightened his tie and was also slowly getting up from the table when a man dressed in a uniform approached him. Dobroslav Jevdević recognized him as the head of the paramilitary wing of SJNK - The Action Section. He got up from the table and shook the officer's hand. Jevdevic motioned for him to sit down with a quick movement of his hand, because he had to talk with him.\n\n\"Good day Mr. Crnjanski. What do you think about the speech of our pious, generous, brilliant Vođz?\" \n\nCrnjanski laughed, sensing the sarcasm and irony in his interlocutor's voice, and added. \n\n\"I can say that I was knocked off my feet. I just don't know if it was because I couldn't stop laughing or if it was so shocking.\"\n\nJevdević laughed as well, but his expression was instantly more serious. He leaned slightly over the table and continued. \n\n\"No matter if this man had enough charisma to unite the whole brothel under him or not, he is a madman out of touch with reality. I hope Zenit, like the Orjunaši, is aware of this because it can lead to many unpleasant consequences for our factions. Therefore, I would like to ask-\"\n\nCrnjanski cut him off with a slight scowl. He didn't trust ORJUNA, just like Dvorniković, so he spoke sharply.\n\n\"About an alliance between our organizations. Yeah, yeah. I will say that Mitrinović wanted such an alliance but I assure you that it will be temporary and when the power vacuum after Dvorniković appears, we will throw ourselves at each other's throats\"\n\nJevdevic nodded, then sat back down in his chair, not wanting the meeting to look too suspicious.\n\n\"So, I understand we have a deal? Yes?\"\n\n\"Yes, but we'll talk about the details another time because it's too loud here and I am a quiet man, but apart from that, the walls here have ears, so be cautious and don't chatter left and right about our secret deal.\" \n\nJevdevic winced a little at these words, but he understood the point. He looked at his watch and without a word walked away from the table on the way to the exit. He only looked back to see that Crnjanski had disappeared into thin air."

Leontic woke up today surprised as he was the one who had been summoned to Belgrade for the sudden deliberations of corporate members. He did not expect such a situation, as he announced a state of emergency until the situation in the country stabilized. He had a bad feeling about this sudden meeting, but immediately showed up with his bodyguards to protect him in case of emergency. His confusion was only deepened when he saw that it was not a trap, but that the meeting was in fact going on when he entered the room. He saw many familiar faces like Bulat, Jevđević, Ujević and others, but also new ones like Aćimović, Jonić and Muścicki. However, another figure stood out the most, taking the second most convenient and visible place - Dimitrije Ljotić. There was a second seat next to him and he motioned Leontić to sit next to him. Leontic immediately rushed to him and then asked him.\n\n\"What is going on here?\"\n\n\"We are discussing some matters. They may hurt you, but the sooner we get over it, the better for all of us. So sit back and don't be afraid. Nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\"What? What do you mean by this? Answer me!\"\n\nLeontić jumped up, but Ljotić indicated with his hand that it was unnecessary. This symbol convinced Leontić that the dice had been cast. He sat back down in the chair and Ljotić got up and started a short speech.\n\n\"We are gathered here to discuss one of the major changes. Our friend, Ljubo Leontić, served the Slavic brothers faithfully and defended the oppressed against ultramodern madness. He will be rewarded for this effort, but we will certainly agree that we cannot stop merely from changing one person to another. We must touch the hearts of our people and return to our glory days. We need a radical transformation of our nation, which I am going to guarantee. We are gathered here because I want to raise the subject of the next change of power, because I believe that we should save our country from godless communism, liberalism and futurism. Let me ask you a question. Will you support me in this holy task?\"\n\nAfter a short murmur, to Leontić's horror, who was watching everything with the greatest attention, all the people in the crowd slowly shouted, \"I'll help!\" Not only the Chetniks whom he invited to join the government, but also his friends. Ujevic stood up immediately and shouted enthusiastically as he often changed sides in a political conflict. Seeing this, Bulat stood up as well. Only Jevđevic thought for a moment, but also stood up at last. Seeing the lack of opposition, Ljotić added one more word which struck Leontić like a nail stuck in a coffin.\n\n\"If no one is against, I will replace our friend Leontić, who will be dismissed, and I, not as Vođz, but as Holy Regent, promise you to restore the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and bring back the king that we need.\"\n\nAfter these words, everyone cheered, and even Leontić, who was only sitting from the whole meeting, finally got up, remaining silent, knowing that this was the best scenario in this situation for him."

Please tell me what you've been doing lately.\"\n\nDvorniković started by speaking in a sweet voice. Leontić dared to answer the words in a calm voice. He put his hands folded on the table and began to speak.\n\n\"The Action Section successively dealt with the last remnants of the reactionary activity in Serbia and we are preparing several dozen operations on separatist nests in Croatia and Bosnia\"\n\nDvorniković listened patiently to Leontić's speech, but the constant tapping of his fingers on the table did not do any good. When Leontić was done, Vođz Dvorniković got up and slammed his fist on the table, then pointed his finger accusingly at the head of Orjunaši.\n\n\"BULLSHIT!

We wanted to open an exhibition at the National Museum.\"\n\n\"And I assume that this new avant-garde exhibition required a chest full of weapons given to you by the Bulgarian commies?

Your petty interests and conflicts?\"\n\nHe sighed heavily, then the door banged open and a squad of soldiers entered the room and stood at the table.

In some parts of the country they did not yet know that Dvorniković was rotting in prison, and many loyalists were still in hiding. Leontić sat in his office wondering about the government's further tactics. His ultimate goal was to create an integral democracy that would be stable to keep all nations in check while avoiding a tyranny similar to that planned by the would-be totalitarian Vođz. He met with many representatives of opposition parties - both communists and democrats, but today he had a really interesting meeting planned. Velibor Jonić, a member of the former king's court, a teacher at a military academy and also a member of the Chetniks, more specifically the ZBOR party. Leontić collaborated with Chetniks and was afraid that now that Dvornikovic was overthrown you would want something from him. The soldier opened the door and Jonić entered the room. Leontić showed him a seat opposite his desk. Before Jonić took his place, he took off his hat and hung it with his coat on the hanger.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Jonić. How are you?\"\n\n\"In great mood, sir. I am really glad that ORJUNA freed our country from this psychopath. And also that we can finally come out of hiding, because we don't have to fear reprisals. I might criticize this familiarity with communists and liberals, but not the time and place for that.\"\n\n\"Yes I’m also glad that we succeeded, but could we proceed to the topic? I don't want to be rude, but I really have a lot on my mind lately and I have to restore order because other countries are slowly noticing the lack of Dvorniković's speeches.\"\n\n\"I just came in on this topic. Our mutual friend, Dimitrije Ljotić, suggested to me that you might need our help once again. You know, many citizens miss the monarchy, so returning familiar faces could help stabilize your government. The soldiers would be confident and the people would be calmer that you did not want to continue Dvorniković's madness.\"\n\n"I see what you are proposing... It is a dangerous offer, I must say and I do not know if I will not have to consult and discuss it. We have cooperated with you before, and I know your environment, and you would be a good solution, but I do not know if I can trust you. I'll think about a proposition, but for now I think we'll have to end the meeting.\"\n\nSaid Leontić, and Jonić got up from his chair, nodding his head. He spat a laconic \"I understand\", then headed for the door and said goodbye to Leontić. Leontić pondered the proposal made to him, and finally, after some reflection..."

Some witnesses said the explosion could even be seen from across the other side of the city. Bulgarians had tried to infiltrate our structures beforehand in order to weaken the potential threat that we might allegedly pose to them but these attempts were not that bold. The perpetrator was Arthur D. Howden Smith, a Bulgarian citizen of American descent. It is obvious that Stamboliyski denied funding IMRO on the grounds that the organization had reactionist and anti-socialist roots, so it would be foolish to assume that Smith was collaborating with Sofia.  \n\nBut even if Stamboliyski is right we should use this attack and put pressure on Sofia that we would be able to pass more radical bills and centralize power, thanks to which we will gain more control over Bulgaria's domestic policy and we will be able to integrate it.

Truth has it that independence would mean nothing but weakening our great Homeland, opening the Dalmatian wound even further, potentially allowing the damned Italians to take the entire Slavic coastline. As for uniting all Croats under one banner - that has already happened. It’s obvious their platform is a platform of chaos, disorder, disunity, and conflict.

Located right next to Karlovac, near the Austrian border.

The entire arms plant was essentially defunct, slowing down the much-awaited modernization of the Yugoslav army.

Right off the bat, he told the workers they cannot count on all of their demands being fulfilled - something they already knew, yet held a spark of hope for success nonetheless. He asked for a written copy of the demands, and when he received it, he and his negotiator team went to work, analyzing every single point, thinking of methods of satisfying both sides with a compromise. The one point that caught his attention was related to democracy. ORJUNA wasn’t exactly opposed to it, but claimed that there are more important matters right now. However, he didn’t know how to tackle it - that is, until Jokić spoke.\n\n\"You know, Mr. Ujević, we are not opposed to that entire ‘corporations’ system you have got going. In fact, we quite like it - it binds us with solidarity, but we believe that for true solidarity, we need to have a say in it too.\" - he said. And that’s when Ujević had a revelation. Democracy within the corporations was the solution. Although not directly listed as a demand, it was no doubt a compromise both sides were willing to accept - the government could adapt to its citizens, making our system organic, a true system of the Nation, and the people would choose the guides of their labor.\n\nHe talked this through with his team, all supportive of the idea, and presented it - this, alongside other, similar compromises, swiftly ended the negotiations, with the government itself deciding that the result is satisfactory, aiming to implement these reforms."

yugoslavia.27.desc:0 "It was early morning and a mist had begun creeping through the field as peasants were swarming the makeshift torturer’s table in a scene that could easily bring to mind the archaic public executions. The small village had been the site of a late night skirmish between the paramilitary organization of the Zenitofori, and organized Croatian rebels which had planned to come and ransack the village for rations and take their revenge on the Serbs who lived there, for their supposed treachery in supporting Zenit’s regime, though their plans were eventually spoiled due to an information leak which led the Zenitofori to intercept them before they had done any damage. The rebel force was entirely decimated, save for a single soldier who was taken for questioning by the Zenitofori’s hierophant. The soldier had bitten off his tongue during the night to avoid questioning, which led the Zenitofori to reconsider their plans for him. He was to be made an example of.\n\n\"You are brought before the ones you intended to slaughter just hours prior to our meeting.\" The hierophant’s clear, zealous voice sounded through the field. \"Take a proper look at them.\" The hierophant had caught him by the hair on the crown of his head and lifted it up, so that he could see the crowd. His eyes were lucid, and his expression – unapologetic. A smirk passed through his left cheek as he spat out a gross, slimy spittle on the ground.\n\n\"So be it. I am offering you one last look. Savor it. For your dishonesty, we had thought up a punishment, but I see that you have already inflicted it upon yourself, though I doubt that it was out of remorse for your actions. You are not without other flaws, however. As everyone here can see, you do not feel any remorse for your actions. This rotten heart that you have is just filling up space in your chest, you have no need for it. We shall offer it as a sacrifice, so that you could at least atone for your brothers’ sins.\"\n\nThe Croat offered no reaction to the fact that he had just heard. He just stared blankly at some point in the distance. The executioner lifted his polished knife and directly plunged it into the man’s chest, and a stream of blood came rushing through the hole. The hierophant took the executioner’s place and immediately reached for the bleeding man. A hallowing shout pierced the fresh morning air as the hierophant severed the bandit’s heart and presented it to the public, still beating. His face contorted into a grimace of utter, unshakeable solemnity as he roared at the crowd:"

yugoslavia.28.desc:0 "The ram thrusted into the church’s doors with unrepentant savagery. The fiery siege of the abbey was coming to an end. The siege was led by a man called Hristofor, who desired to live up to his name, and bring the true word of Christ to the heathens. This is what it has come to. Even the word of Christ has managed to be twisted, mocked, dragged into the mud, alongside politics and mercantilism. This is not the faith that he was taught as a child, this is not our Balkan faith, but foreign incursion, an unnatural tumor that has poisoned the civilized Balkan man’s heart and mind with its \"doctrines\". Pah! Hypocrites, the whole lot of them, subversive thieves, poisoners, deceivers. Annihilators of truth. Of course, there was some good to be found in their ramblings, since they were professing the faith of Christ after all, but it was so twisted and mocked at this point. We have suffered from them for too long, and we desire to suffer them not a second longer. They have been given ultimatums to convert to the true, Balkan, natural faith of Bogomilism - the true continuation of Orphism, and the true doctrine of Christ, unsullied by civilization, politics, and merchandry. Yet most of them have spat in our faces, completely unrepentant of their continuous crimes against our peoples. This one had barricaded himself in his shrine and left his loyal dogs of followers to come at us with their firearms, blast us into oblivion in defense of their priest’s riches and deception - truly the \"essence\" of Christ’s teachings. They were quickly subdued and taken care of. All that was left of the siege was the heavy door, laced with gold and steel, which was soon to be breached by the battering ram.\n\nWith one final, vigorous thrust, the gates were torn open, slamming into the walls of the church with a thunderous roar, which Hristofor picked up on as the crowd swarmed into the building. The terrifying howl of the muscular, roaring, bearded barbarian soon echoed across the until now, serene chapel. A ragged looking man from the crowd had picked up the trembling figure of the priest, holding him against the wall.\n\n\"I will tear you apart, filthy scum, look at what you’ve done with the Balkans! All of this devastation is the consequence of your \"Christian\" doctrines! Are you not at least ashamed?\" Frantically, he pulled out a knife from his belt and held it up to the priest’s neck. Hristofor quickly intervened, and pushed the knife away.\n\n\"This would be enough, have we not what we came for? I trust this man will, despite his crimes, one day repent, for I trust that he is a good man in his heart.\" He turned towards the priest \"Go, and sin no more.\" \n\nThe ragged man let the priest go, and he, knowing that he was spared, regained composure, turned towards the crowd, said a quick prayer for them, and left with tears in his eyes. \n\nHristofor climbed up on the pedestal and began his speech\n\n\"Brothers, we are triumphant once again, for truth will always prevail, since it always exists, even under the veil of deceit. These men have corrupted and sullied the Balkan spirit for long enough, but they are not all wicked, and we must forgive them, for many of them have thought that what they did was best for us, and their institution has ultimately preserved our culture. This, however, becomes impossible in our current age of ideas, widespread literacy, ideology and change. The further they tighten the grip on our ideas, the more apparent their corruption, malice and sedation become. We’re currently standing in a temple. Not a marketplace and not a marketplace, and we shall keep it so. Let us become like children again, unsullied by the baggage of civilization, unsullied by the baggage of polticised doctrine, usullied by the pretense of appearing cultivated. We are hot and cold, not lukewarm and we shall enter Christ’s mouth. We have persisted, and we will persist. In the face of \"cultivation\" we bring forth barbarism. In the face of decadence and luxury, we bring our earnest hearts and honesty. In the face of politicised doctrine, we bring forth theologicized politics. In the face of water, we give our blood.\""

yugoslavia.29.desc:0 "The dark cover of the night was steadily, although not so surely descending upon the palace, its endless march mercilessly interrupted by the vanguard of flames that fought against it. Peter Schulte, the owner of the manor looked down at the bonfire from his honorary seat in his own ballroom, with his hands tied steadily to the chair’s frame.\n\n\"Well, this is certainly not your everyday bonfire\" Schulte thought, as he tried to recall the events that led to this scenario. A group of a few dozen armed men and a woman entered his palace late at night, as he was having his monthly ball. Everyone had thought that this is a robbery, but the bandits had introduced themselves as a \"liberation army\" and proceeded to relieve every man of his upper clothes, and every woman of every cloth she had on herself. They had proceeded to explain that all was well, and they were liberating them from their own, perceived hypocrisy. The marauders had then piled up the stolen clothes, along with their own, and light them up on fire, subsequently instructed every woman to start dancing around the fire, explaining that it is \"the wrath of Mithras\" that had led us to \"our unfortunate circumstances\" and that we would have to appease him. The women had begun reluctantly dancing around the fire, but this wasn’t enough for the rogues, and they had gone to fetch multiple casks of wine and forced the women to drink. Inebriated, some of them eventually gave in to the dance, and started spinning in circles and laughing, to the dismay of their husbands. This was supposed to be a proper gathering of the highest quality, worthy of people of taste, not some debauched, \"avantgarde\" mockery belonging in a whorehouse. What kind of art is this? European art has always been dependent on the classics, which are the epitome of culture. High art is for cultured people, surely everyone can think with their cock…his line of thought was interrupted as a drunken hunk of a peasant challenged him to a \"duel\" by shouting from the first floor and throwing his dirty glove at him. The bandits found this quite hilarious, and he could even hear some of his guests trying to stifle their laughter. Now this is beyond scandalous. As was accepting, he noticed that the bandits immediately cleared off the women from the dancefloor to ensure room for the duel. So, it was going to be in front of everyone. Whatever let’s get on with it. Peter climbed down into the makeshift arena and prepared for the worst. He could smell the drunken giant’s foul sweat emanating from his body as he looked into his delirious eyes. Schulte immediately entered the offensive and went flying at the man. The titan tried to fight back against him, though he was so inebriated, he could barely move. He dashes for the chair next to him, and Schulte knocked him off before he was able to reach for it. He could feel a rush of power immediately coursing through his veins, he felt as if he could take on every man in this room and expel them from his palace."

yugoslavia.30.desc:0 "A great celebration took place in Belgrade. The lands of the Slavs were not deprived of the king they needed. But who could it be? The Orjunaši did not even want to hear the memories of 알렉산다르 카라조르제비치. 조르제 카라조르제비치 was not very interested and was more interested in fishing. So the only right and best choice was - Paul Karađorđević, not only a staunch Pan-Slavist, but also not as badly disposed towards Ljotić's ideas as 알렉산다르. Paul with his family came to the Cathedral of Saint Michael the Archangel in Belgrade around 6 PM, after dusk. Princess Olga wore the most sacred gown and Prince Paul wore the finest uniform. They headed towards the temple, and the entire guard saluted them solemnly. When they entered the Church, the solemn mass began and afterwards Regent Dimitrije Ljotić, Archbishop Josip Ujčić and Patriarch Gavrilo V approached the royal couple, who knelt in front of the altar. The royal crown was introduced into the Church. It collected dust under the rule of the SJNK iconoclasts and now it shines again with the glow of gold and precious stones. Ljotić handed over the crown to the Patriarch who asked the couple while holding it.\n\n\"I here present unto you Paul, your undoubted King and God’s pious servant and his wife, your Queen Olga. Wherefore all you who come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?\"\n\nThe first and loudest shout of "Yes" was that of Dimitrije Ljotić and all those gathered in the temple followed, swearing their allegiance to the new king. The Archbishop continued.\n\n\"Will you protect your subjects in Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro as well as your fellow believers and Slavic brothers and sisters? Will you guard their laws and customs?\"\n\n\"I solemnly promise to do so.\"\n\nThe royal couple replied, and the Patriarch continued to speak.\n\n\"Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?\"\n\n\"I will\" \n\nSaid the couple and both priests began to speak together\n\n\"Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the Laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel? Will you to the utmost of your power maintain in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia the Christian Church? And will you preserve unto the Bishops and Clergy of Slavdom, and to the Churches there committed to their charge, all such rights and privileges, as by law do or shall appertain to them or any of them?\"\n\n\"All this I promise to do. The things which I have here before promised, I will perform, and keep. So help me God\"\n\nPaul and Olga said and Patriarch placed the crown on Paul's head and then on Olga's head.\n\nAfter these words, there was cheering in the Church, and shortly thereafter one could hear cheers outside mixed with the sound of fireworks. Paul and Olga smiled at each other and stood up to go out to the people gathered in front of the Church. When they opened the door together, one could hear one shout screamed almost with one heart."

yugoslavia.31.desc:0 "The Church of Saint Sava was supposed to be a great building, the view of which would dominate Belgrade and would be the pride of the whole of Yugoslavia, however, despite the official building permit, the government of Dvorniković often used the building to blackmail the Church. Once the construction did not meet the requirements. Once, suddenly, the government found contraband in the builders' chests. He once accused the Church of alleged meetings of monarchists around the construction site. And only if the whims of the government were fulfilled, the building could be painstakingly advanced. But now as the ungodly government of SJNK was overthrown, the building progressed at a fantastic pace. The building required some finishing touches, but the interior of the church was filled with beautiful paintings made by the best artists. Milan Aćimović, as the minister of foreign affairs, came to the construction site to admire the beauty of the ten-meter-high building. Aleksandar Deroko, one of the church designers, welcomed the minister and began to lead him around the construction site, then making sure that nothing would happen to the honorable guest. He showed the prepared icons that will be blessed and hung on the walls, as well as a plan of frescoes that will be painted on the church ceiling. Aćimović was delighted with the plans, but was still not sure if such ambitious plans would actually be realized. He gave the green light to continue the work long ago when the continuation project was presented to him, but foresaw that he had been invited due to some complication.\n\n\"So Mr. Deroko. Why am I invited here? I thought the church would be ready in a few years.\"\n\nHe said turning to his companion whom he asked.\n\n\"You see. I followed the example of Haghia Sophia, which is now a mosque, and I would like to make this church almost as great as Hagia Sophia. However, we do not have the resources to do so. Additionally, our builders discovered that some foundations are damaged and we suspect sabotage. We do not know if someone did it recently or if this devil Dvorniković planned to blackmail us once again, although repairing the foundations will take some time and we can fear that they have been contaminated with sugar.\"\n\n\"With sugar?\"\n\n\"It’s a french anarchist technique. It was mostly used to destroy prisons but concrete can be prone to cracks.\"\n\nAltimovic thought about it and scratched his chin, then said.\n\n\"The villages are too much financed by Ljotić and the towns are neglected. The factories are in fairly average condition. Don't get me wrong, I am glad that the villagers have enough to eat and the mortality in the countryside has drastically decreased along with illiteracy, but we must not neglect our national pearls that are our cities!

yugoslavia.32.desc:0 "Bosnia was the seat of Islam among the Slavs in the Balkans since the fifteenth century. Nothing seemed to change for a long time. The brothers held firm in faith in Allah despite the wars or the reluctant stance on the part of Austrians, Serbs or modernists from SJNK. Only now has that changed. When SJNK was overthrown and Ljotić's gang moved in, things started to change. Imam Munir Bajric prayed with the faithful for an end to the persecution of Muslims by his fellow Slavs. It was not a bloody persecution, as it mainly concerned buildings, but it also struck the soul of the faithful. Imams were arrested en masse and beautiful mosques were closed or turned into Churches. Then something unexpected happened. It was Salah time, and all the faithful and the Imam himself turned to Qibla, bowing when suddenly the screams of a man outside were heard. Some gathered at once stood, others finished their prayers and turned to leave. The men advised Imam Bajric to stay in the temple, as it is unknown what was going on. Despite this, he frowned and straightened his mustache, then curiosity won in him and leaned out the window to see and hear the voices of the Orthodox villagers of the village.\n\n\"Hide, hide! They are already here!\"\n\nFather Alexander shouted as he ran towards the mosque and waved his arm. The cassock was blowing in the wind as he approached the church. Imam Munir turned pale immediately and ran out of the temple to meet Alexander. He did not expect that when the Zborists came, the Imam would come out of hiding. Immediately a frown appeared on his face and he shouted at the Imam.\n\n\"What are you doing for god's sake!\"\n\n\"Alexander, I can’t just hide for eternity. They won’t kill me and I must stand in the name of my faith and my community\"\n\n\"So go to church then and hide under the rug. You will wait, you will leave, and you will be able to return to your damn rites!\n\n\"And what then? Someone will hand me over sooner or later, and not only me and my community will have problems, but the whole village! They'll arrest me for a few months or years, and the rest of the community will-\"\n\nThe imam could not finish because a truck arrived in the village and an officer of the ZBOR came out of it. Both priests turned to face them and hid their emotions. The officer left the truck with the rest of the soldiers and approached Munir. He covered him with his eyes, then said.\n\n\"By order of regent Dimitrije Ljotić, we have come to close one of the last mosques in Bosnia. I suppose I am dealing with Imam Munir Bajric now. Nice to meet you.\" The officer said, holding out his hand and Munir shook it in silence. The officer continued.\n\n\"I’m also here to arrest you Mr. Bajric. So I hope that you will not resist and you understand the seriousness of this difficult situation\"\n\n\"Yes I know my fate and I’m not going to resist it. Christ will come and show you your mistake of persecuting Muslims.\"\n\n\"Maybe, maybe no-\"\n\nThe officer smiled slightly at the imam's second sentence and wanted to answer it dismissively when a stone flew towards him. First one, then a second, and then a third. He managed to avoid a blow to the head, but the rock landed on his chest anyway, knocking him out of breath and knocking him off his feet. Muslims and neighbors began throwing stones at soldiers who wanted to close the mosque. The privates who entered the mosque were thrown down the drain, and quickly this small unit had to save itself, knowing that the use of weapons would amount to death. They only left an unconscious officer lying in the mud. The imam, furious seeing this, turned towards the crowd and shouted:"

yugoslavia.33.desc:0 "It was a sunny day in Zagreb when Đuro Vilović arrived at the nationalized Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Orthodox, Protestant, Catholic, he changed religion before he became a priest and did not guess that he would go that far. Thanks to the generous Vođz Dvorniković he will become Patriarch, Pope and Caliph, or rather Poglavar of the new Yugoslavist faith. He despised the old priests and imams for their restrictiveness, but Dvornikovic allowed him more freedom in matters of theology as long as he remained faithful to Yugoslavia. He knew that after becoming Pontifex he would allow some love in the Church. He loved women, they had such wonderful bodies and the Vicar of Christ and successor of Mohammed deserves a little earthly pleasure. He thought so as he got out of his car. He wasn't wearing some very rich clothes so as not to anger the Muslims who agreed to the whole undertaking. Vilović only wore a simple white garment modeled on the Patriarch's robes with a white crown. He had a black long beard reaching to his chest. The only thing that stood out was the symbol of the combined half moon and cross slung around his neck. He slowly entered the Cathedral, the stained glass windows of which were stripped of saints and filled with beautiful stained glass full of symbols representing these saints that served one true God. The Church organ resounded throughout the temple and the newly converted believers looked at the altar or Poglovar. A Massive Book was placed on the altar - Knijga. It contained the Quran and the Bible, but also Yugoslav mythology and the history of "saints''. The future Poglovar approached the altar and opened the Knijga on one of the sides. Vilović started reading it.\n\n\"Seven days of sunshine. Seven nights of blindness. Seven days and nights of planning, for there should be seven hundred and seventy-seven years of revenge for the Germanic captivity. There will be a tragedy. There will be a tyrancide. There will be blood. All in the name of Bog, said Saint Žerajić after he tried to put an end to the cruelty of the traitor Marijan Varešanin. The murder of the beast failed and Žerajić himself committed suicide, as he lived in freedom and wanted to die in freedom.\"\n\nEvery faithful, including Dvornikovic, Tesla and the rest of the SJNK government bowed their heads and fell silent at the words about the death of the Holy terrorist. Vilović closed the book and began a short sermon.\n\n\"Despite the sacrifice of Saint Žerajić and the hosts of other saints throughout the ages, the Slavs are still not united and their divisions are still exploited by nasty invaders. Today, however, we have taken a huge step for the sake of the unity of all Slavs. Brothers professing the same one god were united under one banner of faith. It will take a long time to convert all the lost to the righteous faith, but with our stubbornness, perseverance and unwavering faith we will achieve our goal. I need the same if we want to free these lost sheep from wicked Italians who still oppress our brothers and sisters, but as Poglovar I am going to support Vođz Dvorniković in this difficult task with all my strength and I hope you will help as well. As the Father in heaven wants only one thing from you! UNITY OR DEATH!\"\n\n\"UNITY OR DEATH!\"\n\nEveryone in the church shouted, and the ceremony continued. At one point, Poglovar went to the altar and fell on his face, and all the faithful with him. The Imam and two priests approached Đuro and together they drew the sign of the cross and the crescent moon on his forehead.. After that, the anthem was sung and officially Poglovar of the Yugoslav Church made another announcement."
