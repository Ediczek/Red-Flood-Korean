Apparently, some onion vendor in the city was plying his wares when he got into a fight with an Englishman over the prices. While both blamed each other, the incident was used to spark a major protest that grew into a riot. Unfortunately, some socialist elements in the mob directed them to attack a prison and to free the onion salesman, claiming him to “A hero opposing the tyranny of Britain and the Shah”. This shouldn’t be a major cause for concern if not for the fact that the socialists not only blame the British for the arrest of the innocent onion salesman but have risen to attack their offices and anyone who so much as speaks English, pelting them with rocks and symbolically onions.\nBelieving him to be the ringleader, we secretly had the idiot onion salesman sneaked back to Tehran for interrogation, and we’re going to discover the full extent of his plans. 나라의 여러 곳에서 폭동이 진행 중이고 그 중 대다수가 사회주의자들의 사주로 이루어졌다는 것을 말입니다. 영국 대사 역시 셔흐를 개인 알현하여 셔흐의 조카가 몇몇 “채소 상인들”에게 “크게 모욕당했으”며 정의를 바라고 있음을 알렸습니다. Still, we believe that we can salvage this by interrogating who people on the streets cheer as the “Onion Revolutionary” and working out the full extent of his little plot to overthrow the Shah. 불안한 건 교신이 지연되고 있는 데다, 동시에 벌어진 연대 시위로 여러 도시 행정부가 제 기능을 다하지 못하고 있다는 점입니다."

Attempts have been made to stymie the state Bank-e Melli-ye, as it affords Tehran the freedom to fund the Shah's modernisation projects such as the Trans-Iranian railway. Not yet completed, this railway represents the problem with British control of our economy - progress is too slow and far too uneven. Persia has a choice to make - shall it continue the course and work closer with London to build the nation in the Commonwealth's image - or shall it strike out alone and attempt to break the British yoke? The choice is yet before the Shah as negotiations over Persia's debts and investments have yielded a new proposal. Under this new economic deal APOC will increase oil production at a marginally higher royalty rate, in turn Persia's interest will be reduced and the Imperial Bank will hand over power as the monetary authority in Persia to Bank-e Melli-ye upon payment. The catch of course is that if payments are missed, the terms of the deal need not be upheld, creating an opportunity which apears to be double-edged. Refusal will maintain the unsatisfying status quo, and allow the Shah freedom to manoeveur at the cost of British security guarantees. But the deal is a tempting offer with the promise of further investment from the British in future on the line.

Demands as outrageous like these ought to cost people their heads. But APOC is no ordinary entity. It’s deep connections to the British Empire mean that action against them could throw us into conflict with the Anglo menace. A fate that none are eager to see come about. The reasons APOC cites for these demands are based mainly on the rising threat of war in Europe and how Britain needs easier access to Persian oil fields in order to fuel their vast navy and rapidly expanding air force.\nBritain and the APOC have also been quick to remind us about our debts to the United Kingdom from various loans that we have taken throughout the years, and that Britain would not hesitate to force out payment from us should the need arise, no matter how harsh the actions may be.\nThese debt obligations give us little choice in the matter. It would be foolish to risk embargoes, or worse, war with the Anglo menace. Even if it shall disgrace the Persian nation."

The Shah cited the fact that refusal could result in a government default, possibly provoking a dramatic response from London, a course of events which - he emphasized - the Persian nation cannot afford. \nThe public has been rather less understanding of the government's situation, violently expressing discontent in a number of cities; the APOC is rumored to be expanding their deployment of mercenary troops in response."

These parties and jubilations were inspired more by the end of conflict after months of brutal fighting and the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians alike.\n\nBut these celebrations were marred by concern and melancholy. Only the most naive of the nobility could have ignored the undertones of severe crisis within the court of the Shah. Workers and nationalists across the Persian nation were still furious at foreign domination over the Shahdom. Alongside this, the civil war had left the nation battered and bruised, countless cities had been raised to the ground by the constant barrages of shrieking artillery, famine had broken out in many parts of the country leaving as much as 200,000 dead. And perhaps most importantly, the White armies loyal to the Shah are left exhausted, short of supply and under-equipped. The Shah was all too aware that the root of absolutist power throughout history came from the authority of a standing army. With that gone however, the integrity of the Persian nation seemed vulnerable to say the least.\n\nThese fears were quickly confirmed when a few delegates from the United Kingdom and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company arrived in the court of the Shah along with an entourage of a few hundred soldiers guarding them. The delegation approached the Shah with demands to cede considerable amounts of power to the APOC in Iran as a form of guaranteed payment due to the massive debts that the Persian nation had undertaken during the Civil War. The APOC has reasoned that the conditions of Persia are so poor that the state has become functionally insolvent. In order to ensure that the APOC receives its dues, they have outlined demands which amount to Company rule over the entirety of Persia. There will be no facade of independence this time around, no slight checks and balances on the APOC’s influence.\n\nThe delegation had expected that the audience chamber would burst into outrage and fury against them as had happened so many times before, but surprisingly were met with sorrowful silence. The court knew all too well that rebellion against the APOC and Britain would be impossible. The nation had suffered too much from the civil war to offer resistance, the once proud armies of Persia were now disorganized, battered and exhausted messes. It had become all too obvious that resistance would only inflict far more suffering onto Persia.\n\nIt is because of this that the Shah and the rest of the court by only a slim margin and with a heavy heart had agreed to cede to the demands of the APOC. Persia has now been forced into the annals of history and in its place arises the relic of company rule. An idea that was thought to have been dead since the rebellions of 1858 in India. Already industrialists and Capitalists are flooding into the new corporate state in what has been termed as “The Capitalists playground”, sights of extravagant casinos, hotels, and new Civil Lines are already appearing in newspapers across the world, overshadowing the carefully discredited claims of brutal crackdowns.

But other than those necessary restrictions on anti-worker groups there were no restrictions on who could vote.\nThe elections had been filled with a myriad of different parties and independents. But the election was dominated by two main factions. The Jangal Party, led by Mirza Kochak Khan and a broad coalition calling itself the Tudeh led by Reza Radmanesh. The Jangal Party was originally a sepratist organisation, waging a low-level insurgency in the Northern parts of Persia, now they espouse a more nationalist rhetoric, being strong supporters of both the liberation of the people and the ideal of an Iranian Republic. The Jangal party’s aims are for the immediate development of the productive forces via industrialisation of Iran, so it may rise up from being a feudal desert, into the Tiger of the Orient. Additionally (and more controversially), the decentralisation of the nation into a socialist federation of all Iranian peoples. This platform is further made popular among more conservative minded voters by the party refusing to take a secularist stance. Rather than hold a specific religious doctrine, the Jangal insist that Islam can and will work alongside socialism. The Tudeh meanwhile is a far newer organisation, being formed from various Socialist and Marxist councils, many of whom were the ones that fired the first shots of the Revolution and war of independence against the Shah and the British. The Tudeh wish to re-take the lands that the Shahdom lost while also seeking to create a new type of Socialism, a form of “Syndicalist-Agrarianism”. Unique to the material conditions of Iran. Controversially, the Tudeh also wishes to standardise the Persian language as lingua franca across minority populated regions in order to ensure that such acts of subversion cannot happen again.\n\nAnd so, after weeks of campaigning from both sides, the nation holds its breath as representatives of the worker councils walk into the First Session of the Workers Council."

per.62.desc:0 "When the second meeting of the Worker’s Council entered into session following the victory of Eskandari and the Tudeh party earlier this year, one of the more prevalent issues and divisions within the Tudeh had become apparent. Namely, the question of moderation.\nThe approach that the Tudeh had been taking to the question of the management of Persia had been one of moderation. The Tudeh since its inception had been a party that was divided into two camps. The moderates, who argue that because Persia is an agrarian and pre-industrial nation and therefore lacks a dominant industrial and urban proletariat. As a result it is imperative to push for an agrarian based platform and for agrarian reform throughout Persia. And the radical Socialists who believe that if Socialism is to be successfully developed in the nation of Persia, modernisation and industrialisation is a necessary step that must be taken in order to develop the productive forces of Persia as a whole and in doing so, secure the revolution from outside threats and advance the power of the proletariat and the standard of living in the nation as a whole.\nThe Tudeh was therefore forced to toe the line between these two groups, pursuing a more moderate platform in an attempt to reach a settlement between the two factions. In the days before the civil war, this division had not been as dominant. But now, with no immediate foe to unify against, the question of moderation has come up once again, with the current path that Eskandari and the Tudeh had been taking failing to satisfy neither party. The discontent is at this stage so great that the moderates have threatened to split the party if their demands for the addressing of agrarian concerns are not addressed in the next set of economic plans.\n\nEskandari has therefore mandated the total recall of all ministers back to their respective councils, to ensure that there is accurate representation of the will of the councils as a whole. After this process is complete, for now it remains to be seen which of these factions shall end up dominating the Worker’s Councils, but whoever the victor may be, it is certain that the destiny of Tudeh shall be radically altered."

per.7.t:0 "제헌논의"
per.7.desc:0 "Following the dominance of the Jangal after the 1st Session of the Worker's Council, one of the major debates has been over the path that the Jangal, and consequently, Persia will take. While there has been much agreement over the importance of nationalism, whilst rejecting racial and cultural chauvinism, as a means of serving the revolution and resisting imperialism. There has been much disagreement over the extent that nationalism must be considered and elevated within Persia in relation to Socialism.\n\nMore nationalist factions within the Jangal have argued that as Persia has only ever really developed Feudalism and has not yet even come close to the adoption of Capitalism as the primary mode of production. The countryside is dominated by outdated forces of production such as hand held tools and draft animals, few cities have access to modern industrial production and the situation is generally speaking, totally backwards. Therefore, the current path that the Jangal is taking, of purging and dissolving the Bourgeoisie classes within the nation, is deeply flawed and problematic. These factions preach for working with the National Bourgeoisie to develop the productive forces of Persia and from there establish a Socialist nation.\nMore Orthodox groups within the Jangal however have denounced the nationalist factions of the Jangal as revisionists and even counter-revolutionaries. Citing the fact that the entrusting of the development of the nation to working with the bourgeoisie risks the relapsing of the revolution towards Capitalism as opposed to building a secure road towards Socialism. Orthodox Socialist factions have also argued that a great leap forward from feudalism to Socialism has been proven to be possible, as was observed from the nation of Hungary under the leadership of Leninists such as Bela Kun or the Socialist movements within Bulgaria, who had come from a largely feudal and proto-capitalist condition into a Socialist one within just one or two decades.\nThere are still however many elected representatives that have yet to side with one faction. This lack of a clear majority has led to a small crisis, leading to Mirza Kochak Khan calling for an election within parliament  within the month, with no option to abstain. The decision has been controversial as it was decisive, with protests and complaints being quickly raised in parliament. Nevertheless, the government has made up its mind and all eyes rest on the Jangal to see the road that it will take."

In Persia the Azeri people populate most of the North-Western regions around Ardabil and Tabriz, regions from which the Safavid Dynasty - that gave birth to the modern Persian nation - emerged. It is a historically important region to Persia, one that shares many ties the Nationalists there seek to sever in their misguided pursuit of Nationhood. To the North are two regimes which are no friend to the Azeri nation. The Transcaucasian Revolutionaries seek to add Azerbaijan to their burgeoning Russian Republic, the Armenians seek to displace their people from the highlands.

PER_open_the_private_army_market_desc:0 "전쟁은 전역에서 벌어지지만 병사들에게 필요한 봉급을 줄 수 있는 이들은 얼마 없습니다. 가격을 제시하고 이들에게 우리의 용역을 제공합시다."

PER_free_market_shiite_practises:0 "Free Market Shiite Practises"
PER_free_market_shiite_practises_desc:0 "Classical Islamic Jurisprudence presents a number of barriers to the efficient operation of the market economy, such as harsh limitations on the function of a credit market. However, the subject is deep and complex, and many other interpretations of the Prophet's words exist. By ensuring that those scholars and clergymen who promote obscurantist and unprofitable doctrines are socialists, we can ensure our domain can quickly and smoothly advance into profitable modernity."

PER_knockknock_mr_pahlavi:0 "팔래비 씨 계십니까"
PER_knockknock_mr_pahlavi_desc:0 "With the recent unpleasantness behind us, the time has come to address the deplorable state of governance in Persia. The Shah has now proven himself incapable not only of protecting our assets, but also of maintaining even the most basic rule of law in the country. With the Pahlavi monarchy now… indisposed the opportunity is open for us to move in an assume direct control of the country. Administering the state directly will present us with a number of challenges, but learning from the victories (and defeats) of the great men who built the British Empire, we shall not fail."

PER_expand_oil_industry_in_southern_persia:0 "남이란에서의 석유산업 확대"
PER_expand_oil_industry_in_southern_persia_desc:0 "Southern lands of Persia and persian gulf are extremely rich in oil. We need to expand as much as we can to maximise the possible profit."

PER_start_exploration_in_the_north:0 "북에서의 탐사 시작"
PER_start_exploration_in_the_north_desc:0 "With existence of oil fields near Baku, it is entirely possible that parts of Persia bordering the caspian sea are also incredibly rich in the black gold. Expeditions must be started immediately."

PER_social_lubrication:0 "Social Lubrication"
PER_social_lubrication_desc:0 "It is imperative that we avoid any unprofitable sources of friction with the population... or make sure such issues are filed away in short order. A careful review of the existing laws and a relaxation of the demands on the population, will serve this end, as will offering some long-term contracts to certain professionals among our rapidly growing mercenary community."

PER_liberalise_labour_policies:0 "노동정책 자유화"
PER_liberalise_labour_policies_desc:0 "Liquidating certain obsolescent pseudo-feudal laws related to land tenure and labor levies will allow us to earn some goodwilla among the rural masses, and also create a much more flexible labor pool far better suited to a modern industrial economy."

PER_disband_the_persian_army:0 "이란군 해산"
PER_disband_the_persian_army_desc:0 "The Iranian army proved itself to be highly unreliable during the Civil War, with many soldiers and officers deserting their posts, or even defecting to the Reds. Our own combat specialists preformed far better – in comparison, the Iranian Army is practically a liability, and a political risk besides. Now that we’re directly responsible for their wages, keeping them on the payroll is more trouble than it’s worth."

PER_integrate_britishtrained_soldiers:0 "영국 제식 병력 흡수"
PER_integrate_britishtrained_soldiers_desc:0 "While the Iranian units did poorly, many Persian troops fought valiantly under our command, especially those who had been previously trained by British military missions. We shall sieve the old army for these men as we demobilize it, offering those soldiers and officers who stood the test of battle the opportunity to join on with our forces – for the sort of salary proven men are worth, naturally."

PER_found_oil:0 ""O.I.L." 수립"
PER_found_oil_desc:0 "We have both external enemies in the form of rival companies and internal ones in the form of persian opposition. Organisation of immediate liquidation shall be created to deal with both in the most extreme methods possible."

PER_begin_diversification:0 "Begin Diversification"
PER_begin_diversification_desc:0 "While the oil business seems solid now, it would only take the discovery of a single massive oil-bearing rock formation in some far-flung corner of the world to crash prices and throw our finances into disarray. While operating a state is expensive, it also provides ample opportunities for business expansion – and there is no reason a well-administered state should not turn a tidy profit."

PER_liberate_baku_oil_fields:0 "바쿠 유전지대 "해방""
PER_liberate_baku_oil_fields_desc:0 "Azerbaijan is oppressed by the cruelty of its leaders. We need to save its people from tyranny and in the end they may repay us by allowing us to extract oil from their lands."

PER_ask_london_for_complete_gulf_monopoly_desc:0 "Sadly we do not have monopoly on the territory of the persian gulf. Some of it is ruled by the government back in London. Telegram must be sent concerning the obviously superior option of transferring it to us."

PER_sell_to_whoever_can_pay_desc:0 "No matter your ideology, no matter your views, no matter your race, no matter your faith. You need oil and have money, we will sell. The higher the price the higher the quality of this perfect black gold."

PER_in_europe:0 "유럽에서"
PER_in_europe_desc:0 "Europe is a troubled land, plagued by strange ideas, civil conflict in Russia, the rapacious red huns, and worst of all, the French. In such times, it comes as no surprise that fuel is in high demand, and more than a few men with very specific skills are seeking new frontiers to make a new beginning."

PER_in_the_americas:0 "아메리카에서"
PER_in_the_americas_desc:0 "While the Americas have no great shortage of oil deposits, we have a number of more specialized products and services, which might be greater demand in the troubled lands of the New World."

PER_in_asia:0 "아시아에서"
PER_in_asia_desc:0 "The global east, as much as it has sought to maintain independence with the rest of the World, has nonetheless fallen to tensions and divisions amongst ideological and cultural grounds. We can exploit this, helping them out with tank experiments or perhaps even sending a few soldiers to help capture a city, who knows!"

PER_excelsior:0 "Excelsior!"
PER_excelsior_desc:0 "The peak of our little experiment in Persia, one that seeks to bring a beacon of wealth in a land of backwardsness - has succeeded. We are nothing short of perfection in our modus operandi, and our clients are extremely pleased. Carry on, good folks of the World! You will never run out of oil!"

PER_feed_the_furnaces:0 "Feed the Furnaces"
PER_feed_the_furnaces_desc:0 "Some Yank once said war is a racket – and he was right. With the sorry state of the world, the arms trade is growing more profitable by the day. With our global business reach and ubiquitous shipping presence, we have an opportunity to rapidly develop a state-of the art military-industrial complex without cutting into our bottom line."

PER_bread_and_circuses:0 "빵과 서커스"
PER_bread_and_circuses_desc:0 "The Romans understood a great many things, and their methods of managing the mob have proven sound all down the ages. A starving man is desperate, willing to try anything – and a bored man with idle minds will do the devil’s work. Ensuring the people are well fed will provide us a stable workforce and defang any surviving Marxist demagogues."

PER_the_praxeology_of_empire:0 "The Praxeology of Empire"
PER_the_praxeology_of_empire_desc:0 "The civil war has reveled a number of weakness in our previous management strategy; most cripplingly a near-fatal myopia regarding the scope of our business. Some interesting new theories hold that economics encompass the whole scope of human action; accordingly, we must consider this same scope when formulating our new and expanded company - and state - policy."

PER_neohessians:0 "신 헤센군"
PER_neohessians_desc:0 "The Germans were respectable enemies once, but they’ve since fallen to the red devil, who’s poor understanding of martial matters is matched only by their incompetence at basic economics. Thankfully, at least two or three of the Jerries seem to have realized this and sought other employment. While some went to Austria or the Imperial remnant, others went farther afield, seeking wealth and adventure./nWe can provide both."

PER_russian_mercenaries:0 "러시아인 용병들"
PER_russian_mercenaries_desc:0 "Britain once hired an entire Russian Army to fight a war, which was a capital idea – and one we find ourself with the opportunity to imitate.\n하계 정변을 겪기 전부터 러시아는 불안한 경제와 무능한 정부로 고통받아왔습니다. 수많은 러시아인들이 어떤 이유로든 자국을 떠나 자신들을 부양하기 위해 무기를 들었고, 중국과 그 너머의 전장들에서 자신들의 수완을 입증해보였습니다. 이들을 우리 용병으로 끌어들인다면 인력과 재능의 유입을 우리에게 안겨줄 것이지만, 페르시아인들의 계속될 선의에만 너무 기대진 말도록 합시다."

PER_keeping_war_off_our_shore:0 "우리 해안에서 전쟁을 걷어내며"
PER_keeping_war_off_our_shore_desc:0 "While we’ve already proven to the shareholders that we can use war as a business, the actual fighting is rather untidy, and tends to regrettably destructive. As such – it’s something best done on other people’s property. With the continued expansion of our mercenary forces, we now have the capacity to ensure threats are neutralized before our sovereignty is threatened."

PER_market_dominance:0 "시장우세"
PER_market_dominance_desc:0 "We already hold an influential position in the petroleum market within the British Empire, but with the emerging economic miracle in our Persian lands we stand posed to do so much more.

PER_repay_the_revolution_desc:0 "공산주의자들은 임금노동을 폐지하고자 했습니다. 그들이 원하는 대로 해줍시다. 규모가 큰 무급 노동력은 내전으로 황폐화된 나라의 재건을 촉진하는 데 도움이 될 것이며, and no one on the winning city will have any qualms with seeing the traitors punished as they deserve."

PER_open_up_local_governments:0 "현지 정부 개관"
PER_open_up_local_governments_desc:0 "Most issues which actually affect people on a daily basis are intensely local matters. There is no need for us to maintain an expensive bureaucratic apparatus to centralize matters which can be most efficiently resolves at a community level – and people content with local government will have less reason to worry about far-away matters, such as who exactly controls the state as a whole."

PER_stable_authority_desc:0 "우리가 해냈습니다! 어려움들에도 우리는 마침내 우리의 권위를 공고히 했습니다. The common people accept us as an acceptable - even preferable - alternative, to irresponsible decadence of the old Shah or the destructive incompetence of the communists. Moreover, we have established a strong base of support among the Persians, and our programs of modernization and consumer investment have begun the process of easing the resentment caused by the low-quality government services provided by the prior regime. Relations between the great races of Europe and the Orient have never been better."

PER_sell_shares_to_local_elites:0 "이란 정예층에게의 지분 매각"
PER_sell_shares_to_local_elites_desc:0 "While we had common cause with many of the Persia royal establishment in fighting the Reds and ensuring stability, we cannot guarantee this will be true forever. However, we aim to pay a healthy dividend at least until Judgment Day. By issuing new shares to sell to the notables of Persia, we can raise funds for further investment, and also align their interests with our own."

PER_engineering_civl_service:0 "공공용역 설계"
PER_engineering_civl_service_desc:0 "It is no longer sufficient for us conduct ourselves as a resource extraction agency, hiring a tiny percentage of the Persian population to extract resources for sale abroad.

PER_lessons_from_ford:0 "포드에게서의 교훈들"
PER_lessons_from_ford_desc:0 "Ford has his eccentricities, but even more impressive than his survival of the American depression is his successful management of labor opposition. We have taken detailed notes on these (and other) strategies for scientific work planning, protecting the well-being (and purchasing-power) of workers, and controlling potentially dangerous labor movements; the time has come to implement them."

PER_education_according_to_plan:0 "우리 계획에 따른 교육"
PER_education_according_to_plan_desc:0 "우리의 통치에 진정으로 도전하기에 당장의 페르시아인들은 전쟁으로 크게 지쳤습니다. 하지만 그게 영원하리라 기대해선 안 됩니다. 따라서 우리는 집단교육을 위한 새 교과과정을 주의를 기울여 설계했습니다. 문맹퇴치는 분명 우리 경제에 이득이 될 테지만, 더 중요한 건 다음 세대에 우리가 미쳐버린 이 세계의 질서와 번영의 보루임을 각인시키리란 점입니다."

PER_native_offices:0 "현지인 관료들"
PER_native_offices_desc:0 "페르시아인들 가운데 야망 넘치는 젊은이들이 좌절하게 두어선 안 됩니다. 우리의 목표를 진전시켜 이들이 자기네 동포들보다 높은 자리에 오를 수 있도록 허락함으로써 우리의 권력구조로 들어올 수 있도록 하고, 민족주의자들이나 공산주의자들에게 물들지 않도록 길들이는 것이 훨씬 낫습니다."

PER_new_propaganda_drives_desc:0 "APOC이 이란의 구원자입니다! 구 정부의 후진스러운 퇴폐에게서 이 땅을 구한 게 우리였으며, 악마스러운 공산주의자들이 들고 일어나 이란과 이슬람을 파괴하려 들었을 때 놈들을 지옥으로 보낸 것도 바로 우리였습니다. This message shall be made clear to all, a first line of defense against any recurrence of Marxist thought."

PER_pay_off_royalists:0 "왕당파 보상"
PER_pay_off_royalists_desc:0 "이제 왕실은 우리 회사의 이익과 무관합니다. 대신, 옛 왕실을 향한 충심과는 거리가 먼 이란 내 장교들, 특히 현지인 장교들에겐 아직 관련이 깊습니다. 복잡한 대화를 통한다면 어려운 일이겠지만, 보십시오, 뇌물을 통하면 훨씬, 훨씬 쉬운 일입니다."

PER_soldiers_of_fortune:0 "용병들"
PER_soldiers_of_fortune_desc:0 "It has become clear that we've fended off against war in our shores. Our surrounding nations have no animosity or claims against us, and our lands find themselves in immense peace. Therefore, to maintain our economy lubricated and going perfectly, we should be using up all these mercenaries coming here to maintain order as soldiers across the World's conflicts, receiving lots of money and glory - of course, with a little share to us."

PER_investigate_strategic_deterrence_desc:0 "상비군은 비쌉니다. 수익성 높은 해외 작업장에 배치할 수 없는 수준이라면 특히 그렇습니다. 역사에서 보았듯 방위군의 필요성은 의문할 여지도 없는 것이지만, 최근 우리는 흥미로운 주장을 접했습니다. 막아내기엔 버거울 잠재된 침략까지 억지해낼 정도로 파괴적인 새 무기 말입니다. 생뚱맞은 소리 같긴 해도, 그냥 넘기기엔 몹시 구미가 당기는 가능성입니다."
