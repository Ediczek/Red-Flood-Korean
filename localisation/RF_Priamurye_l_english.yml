#FOCUSES
PRI_venice_on_amur:0 "The Venice on Amur"
PRI_venice_on_amur_desc:0 "Here in the frontier of Russian settlement, there is still one city worthy of that title, the so-called Europe in the Orient. Now that the liberals, socialists, and radical generals have made a mess of Harbin, the true center of power in Zheltorossiya draws power to it inexorably. The situation all around us is chaos, of course, but the Primorskaya Oblast is a locus of trade and resources, all centered upon our fair Vladivostok. Now that our hand is forced, we have much work ahead to become an actual state."
PRI_lawyers_touch:0 "A Lawyer's Touch"
PRI_lawyers_touch_desc:0 "Salutations, Spiridon Merkulov. Let no one say that Vladivostok is bereft of governing talent. Once a lawyer, then a member of the Imperial Duma, and then a member of our own Soviet as a Kadet, the man’s political career is long and full of occasional forays into the Ministry of Agriculture. If we are to craft a stable state where the rule of law is respected, we will have his expertise. Unlike the warlords to our west, we will uphold a government with real legitimacy at home and on the international scene. Shall we get to work on our constitution?"
PRI_a_merchant_hand:0 "A Merchant's Hand"
PRI_a_merchant_hand_desc:0 "Greetings unto you, Nikolai Merkulov. The wealthy merchant of the Russian Far East (and one-time Duma member in the Empire) knows our strengths by heart - our resources, our position at the end of the Trans-Siberian Railway, our beautiful maritime port city linking us to Japan and the Americas. It is he who will bring the businessmen of Primorye in line with our state and restore confidence in business as usual. It is he who will bring the economic common sense gleaned over a lifetime into government in Vladivostok. Let us get down to business."
PRI_the_brothers_merkulov:0 "The Brothers Merkulov"
PRI_the_brothers_merkulov_desc:0 "It is evident that power in Primorye is beginning to gather around the Merkulov brothers. It is also evident that the two have certain political differences that have become impossible to ignore. The failure of Zheltorossiya highlighted the problems inherent in the Republic’s model of democracy, but what solution is prescribed? In smoke-filled rooms behind closed doors in Vladivostok, the Merkulovs and their supporters have many long days ahead of them, making their arguments and calling in support from across the Krai. Will Spiridon be the one atop the pyramid? Or will Nikolai?"
PRI_spiridon_the_wise:0 "Spiridon, the Wise"
PRI_spiridon_the_wise_desc:0 "In the end, considering his record of public service and experience in government, it was judged prudent for Spiridon Merkulov to continue to hold the reins of the republic. Though there were whispers of dissent from Nikolai’s supporters, the brothers and the Kadet coalition in Vladivostok now present a unified front with which to solidify the state in Primorye."
PRI_thinking_man_republic:0 "A Thinking Man's Republic"
PRI_thinking_man_republic_desc:0 "The masses – they can't be trusted. The ancients knew well that a true Republic does not respond to the irrational whims of the mob. Instead, an elite of the most virtuous and wise leads the nation in the spirit of brotherly unity. This high ideal will be the blueprint for our project of the renewal of the Russian Republic – the old government failed exactly because of its populism, Kerensky's nonsensical appeals to the masses. We will not repeat this mistake. Only the educated property-holders will be able to vote and decide on the fate of our common beloved Republic."
PRI_boyar_for_a_new_era:0 "Boyars For A New Era"
PRI_boyar_for_a_new_era_desc:0 "In the olden days, the Russian people knew democracy, unshackled by the tyranny of the autocratic system. Yet, the truly Russian form of democracy was nothing like the rule of the rabble Socialists want to bring over our land. The esteemed republics of Novgorod and Pskov limited their full citizenship only to the wealthy class of boyars of noble descent. In our modern day incarnation of this order, we will no longer honor aristocratic birth – but, our free, property-holding citizens have to know their place as a rightful knightley elite of our glorious Republic."
PRI_the_price_liberty:0 "The Price of Liberty"
PRI_the_price_liberty_desc:0 "Freedom isn’t free. It’s a tough lesson we all have to learn. The citizens of our country have to know discipline and bravery to defend their freedom. For true liberty is not the wonder-land the socialists promise - it’s sometimes hard, difficult to bear, but it is always truly just and beautiful. The so-called “injustices” of capitalism are just the consequences one has to take accepting liberty - and we do not fear this responsibility."
PRI_justice_weighted_wings:0 "Justice's Weighted Scales"
PRI_justice_weighted_wings_desc:0 "The classical ideal of the State is the embodiment of Justice - justice that can be sometimes ruthless, but always right. We will not listen to the rebels and rabble-rousers demanding the sanctity of Justice to be defiled for some kind of  “social good”, for we know that this is the quickest path to tyranny. The new Republic will remain a nation of law above all, the Russian peasant has to be taught to obey the rules like a German."
PRI_judge_of_amur:0 "The Judge of Amur"
PRI_judge_of_amur_desc:0 "The settling of Primorye’s new institutions is at long last complete. Spiridon Merkulov’s measured hand has led the crafting of a state apparatus that shines in comparison to the morass of violence and chaos all around us. The Russian Republic, yes, but shorn of its excesses. With the levers of power open to those who have the most vested interest in the continuity of the state, we will not fall again!"
PRI_shatter_Green_wedge:0 "Shatter the Green Wedge"
PRI_shatter_Green_wedge_desc:0 "Bone-chilling tales are coming from the northeastern rogue republic of the Ukrainians. Refugees tell us of the unspeakable cruelties of the UPA, an animal savagery unleashed on all Russian men and women in the boundaries of that despicable state. In the wake of these horrifying atrocities we know that there is no place for compromise or peaceful unification with Green Ukraine. We won't sit silently while our brethren are slaughtered. Our army has to march in and teach these khokhols a lesson!"
PRI_silence_the_red_leeches:0 "Silence the Red Leeches"
PRI_silence_the_red_leeches_desc:0 "Harbin was taken over by an abomination! The formerly respected politician, Alisa Rosenbaum, struck a Faustian bargain with the worst tyrant of Communism - Alexei Gastev. Together, they spread poisonous ideology, preaching chaos and revolt of the unwashed masses against their enlightened masters. To save Russia and her humanity we have to put an end to this pitiful peasant revolt!"
PRI_subjugate_yellow_menace:0 "Subjugate the Yellow Menace"
PRI_subjugate_yellow_menace_desc:0 "To our eternal chagrin, the Chinese disease of warlordism and division has spread north into what was once the republic! Bandits of every stripe plague our border with the Beijing regime, threatening the stability of the republic and the lives of Russian settlers everywhere. It goes without saying that this is intolerable if we want to be a reputable state on the global scene - are we the Goumindang, or the fallen Empire? Or are we Russians?"
PRI_land_of_money_and_milk:0 "Land of Milk and Money"
PRI_land_of_money_and_milk_desc:0 "The dust settles on Zheltorossiya, and with the separatists, bandits, and radicals put underground, a new stability reigns over the Russian Far East. Just as in the Russian Civil War, disaster struck the fledgling Russian Republic, and yet again, through great national effort, it has been saved. As toasts are held through Vladivostok, it is now time to think of the future. The Merkulovs have led Primorye into a profitable and stable state of affairs - now what are they to do with it? First and foremost, it is time to recognize that this state is more than just the Maritime Province of old. Then we must grapple with uncertainty to our north and west. At least now we can be assured our leadership is equipped to meet it."
PRI_nikolai_the_shrewd:0 "Nikolai, the Shrewd"
PRI_nikolai_the_shrewd_desc:0 "In the end, having successfully swayed enough of the Primorye bourgeoisie to his side, Nikolai Merkulov leveraged his credentials as an outsider with a proven business record to become the head honcho in Vladivostok. Intent on taking a harder line against identified threats to the republic and enterprise, the ascended merchant won his brother and his faction over to create a new united front of Kadets. Now comes the hard work."
PRI_iron_hand_market:0 "The Iron Hand of the Market"
PRI_iron_hand_market_desc:0 "With our faction in control in Vladivostok, the time has come to unleash the productive forces that were always threatened by Harbin's entrenched idiocy. No longer will the natural functioning of the market be at risk of interference from outsiders. The new state economic code proscribes anything to change that. The agreements of self-interested parties - who have a real stake in the system's stability - will be the sole "regulation" of the economy, and our expenditure on programs that distort its function will be slashed to the bone. Even our army will have financial rewards for dynamism in accomplishing its tasks!"
PRI_supply_demand_violence:0 "Supply and Demand of Violence"
PRI_supply_demand_violence_desc:0 "Look around you, businessman. Is it not evident from Mother Russia that the losers of our great economic game will seek to overturn the whole table? The solution to threats both unionist and insurgent can thankfully be bought on the market. Through organizing our young partisans into a security company and formally legalizing similar corporations in our country, we can turn defending the state and economy into a profitable enterprise. After all, high-minded ideology is well and good, but loyalty to a livelihood is easier to understand."
PRI_enshining_man_rights:0 "Enshrining Man's Rights"
PRI_enshining_man_rights_desc:0 "Across Eurasia, the rights of man are trampled upon by regimes both chaotically populist and stiflingly authoritarian. An enlightened state in Russia must sail between the Scylla of Kolchakocracy's state monopolies and the Charybdis of feeding the economy into the fires of revolution. As we craft the constitution of a Primoryan republic, we must drag our slice of Russia away from both extremes and towards a profitable future. The rights of man to their property will be the foundation."
PRI_amurian_dream:0 "The Amurian Dream"
PRI_amurian_dream_desc:0 "On the eastern reaches of the continent, a new kind of dream arises – one of opportunity and glory. With the rights of property secured and protected from the socialist vultures, the people of Amur can cast off their chains and create for the sake of their nation! No longer shall the businessman be crushed under the demands of the parasitic unions, nor will the Russian man have to bow to foreigners in his own country. Every one of us will have the potential to enrich himself, and spread the fame of our people far and wide. We have a dream of a free and powerful Russia and we will not back down from anything to achieve it!"
PRI_doge_of_vladivostok:0 "The Doge of Vladivostok"
PRI_doge_of_vladivostok_desc:0 "The die is cast. Here on the Pacific, in Russia’s greatest eastern city, the unique geographical and political position of Primorye will be the seed of a freedom the likes of which never properly took root in Russia. The hands of Nikolai and Spiridon Merkulov have forged a new Venice, designed to guarantee the proper functioning of the economy necessary for the liberty that follows naturally from it. With all obstacles at home cast aside, the road - or sea - is clear for us to profit. And profit we shall."

PRI.1.t:0 "It's a rich man's world"
PRI.1.desc:0 "The Duma gathered in Vladivostok town hall to discuss quite an important issue, which was the leadership of the young republic.  It was no surprise that there were only two serious candidates. Spiridon and Nikolai Merkulov. Few paranoid people commented on the situation as evidence of corruption, but few listened to them. Corrupt or not, they were the heroes who saved democracy from the yellow threat, red beast and Ukrainian terrorists. Nikolai Merkulov carefully watched the situation and counted each member of the Duma who entered the room. He was more direct than his brother, knowing that sometimes you have to get around the law and resort to violence. Spiridon waved him in front of him, most likely wishing him good luck. He was calmer than his brother, valuing justice and wisdom as the most important virtues. After a while, both brothers silenced the meeting, seeing that all those who were to appear had already entered the room. Spiridon started. \n\"We are here to take part in the democratic process. Democracy is an important part of the citizen's life. Elections are a celebration of democracy. Showing that democracy is the most perfect system, because it allows not only to praise what is wise and beautiful, but it allows everyone to work together for the benefit of the state.\" Nikolai, who was not a people person, continued after his brother, trying to do his best. He slapped his fist on the open palm and spoke firmly. \n\"However, democracy without security is only chaos and anarchy. So we have to make a quick leadership decision and go back to ensuring our situation. Good leadership in these difficult times is very important.\" Spiridon ended the short dual-speech. \n\"Therefore, my brother and I ask you to think carefully who you will choose and who will be the better candidate for this position. We have many problems to solve and, with my brother, I agree that a good leader is essential. Aristotle distinguished two types of democracy - Timocracy and Politeia. Timocracy was an ochlocracy, degenerated system that allowed cruelty to play a role in the government. Politeia on the other hand, as the righteous system, praised wisdom, it was the democracy of the wise. We intend to renew his words and we hope that all gathered here are above all righteous and wise and will choose according to their conscience.\" The whole hall rose to the two brothers who bowed almost theatrically. The vote began shortly after this speech. The counting of votes also went smoothly and both brothers at that time posed for photos or talked with the audience. After a short time, both brothers entered the center of the room again and..."
