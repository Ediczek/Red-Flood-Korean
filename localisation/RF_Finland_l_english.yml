#TOOLTIPS#
FIN_DESC_MENU:0 "Near the end of the Great War, Russia fell to civil war between those loyal to the monarchy, and Republican factions. Finland, an autonomous duchy within the Empire, was not spared, with red and pro-independence factions rising up from the swamps of Karelia and fighting against the Pro-Russian loyalists. After years of fighting and tens of thousands dead, the Communist movement was defeated and Finland remained a de jure territory of the Russian Empire. However, outside of the Finnish nobility, there are few that wish to remain puppets of the Russians, and only time will tell if the people of Finland will make their voices heard."

#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_ALBERT_SEYN_DESC:0 "Franz Albert Seyn is not a particularly proud man, but nor is he a man who has nothing to be proud of. Governor-General of Finland since 1909, Seyn has done a better job of governing Finland than any Russian authorities expected, or cared for that matter. However, the respect of his superiors has come at the cost of the support of Finland's people. Though some might say that a Russian warlord should care little for his subjects, Seyn knows that, should his clique fall, the Russian army will likely not see Finland as worth saving. Therefore, if he does not consolidate support soon, he will be at the mercy of whatever political force decides to replace him."
POLITICS_KEKKONEN_DESC:0 "While many have heard this man's name and the innumerable tales surrounding it, few can comprehend the truths behind the man. Sometimes, when he sits alone on the balcony of the Supreme Leader's Palace, he feels as though he is the only one who knows everything about himself. And even then, Kekkonen's trust in himself falters. After all, what's left for a man after everyone around him has fallen into madness, and begun worshipping him as a god? Is it more sane to call out, to try and stop all of this? Or is it better to simply embrace the madness?"
POLITICSILMARI_DESC:0 "Despite being entirely German, Ilmari I now finds himself King of Finland. Thrust into power in a strange land, this Ilmari knows that his situation is as strange as it is brimming with opportunity. After all, a strong German monarchy has not existed in Europe since the Vaterland fell to godless councilism. Even Ilmari's noble allies in Prussia have only managed to establish a military junta, lacking a proper heir to the throne. But now, there is a German who stands strong above his Kingdom. And this German just may have the stones to reclaim Berlin."
POLITICS_KARL_WILKAMA_DESC:0 "With Seyn deposed, the position of Finnish leadership has fallen temporarily in Finnish General Karl Fredrik Wilkama. Interestingly, though Finland does not yet have an officially established state, this Mark's the first time in nearly 700 years when Finland was entirely independent. Thusly, Wilkama has been given the unofficial title "Father of Finland" by the press and general populace."
POLITICS_ASPA_DESC:0 "Depending on who you ask, Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa is either a power-mad dictator, a visionary with ambitious plans for Finland, or just plain crazy. Aspa is obsessed with the idea that Finland and its people were descended from Ancient Egyptians, and he seeks to reconnect Finland with its ancient legacy. Meanwhile, the world desperately clings to their disbelief in his theories, all the while his state's legitimacy and continued existence forces humanity to ask whether common sense truly governs the truth at this point. Hell, even if he's wrong, isn't that reality more exciting?"
POLITICS_FURUHJELM_DESC:0 "Ragnar Furuhjelm never imagined he would ever lead Finland, much less having the honor of ushering in its independence. Despite having served Russia, Furuhjelm has always had Finnish sympathies, and a desire to see his people out from under the Russian boot. Now that he has been thrust into power, Furuhjelm looks forward to the day when he can resign and serve a truly free Finland."
POLITICS_PAASIKIVI_DESC:0 "A Conservative Nationalist, Juho Kusti Paasikivi has earned the title of First President of Finland. For much of Finland's recent history, Finland's democrats have merely focused on freedom, resolving to discuss political minutia once peace and liberty reigned over Finland. And now that time has come, a time which Paasikivi has long been preparing for. Paasikivi's national plan includes Finlandization, the opening of protected Finnish markets, establishment and strengthening of the Finnish army, and political liberalization."
POLITICS_VALNO_TANNER_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_KALLIO_DESC:0 "A Liberal Progressive, Kyosti Kallio has earned the title of First President of Finland. Until now, Finnish liberals have happily cooperated with conservatives, content to wait until Finland is ready for democracy. Now, that time has come, and Kyosti Kallio can finally turn his long-held dreams into reality: a liberal democratic Finland, free of all foreign occupation. Kallio's plan for Finland includes fully free markets, De-Russification, military funding, and mass liberalization."

We shall liberate it according to the wishes of our Pharaoh, and secure it from the horror of Arabization.

Never again shall we be lost in the dark, unknowing of who we are as people, stuck in some miserable ideal of "Finno-Ugrianism", some nonsense which has no origin, no truth, and nothing of beauty."

A political feud has erupted into full fledged Civil War with no clear indicator of which path the Russians are heading. This presents us with numerous consequences as our own status remains unclear itself. There is already talks of overthrowing sentiments inside the opposition as the continued Russification and absence of Russian garrisons presents us with a powder keg about to burst into flames any second..."

FIN_dreams_of_old_fatherland_desc:0 "After the death of the King, many became completely disillusioned with the nonsense spouted by the Pro-Monarchists, who are all Prussians and foreigners, likely uninterested in the wellbeing of Finnish people in general. Therefore, Aspa and his forces, such as Edward Juutilainen's soldiers, have marched on Helsinki and declared the Thirty-Fourth Dynasty, as we dream of Aspa's fantastical theories of a lost Egypt in the Black Lands of Finland where he theorizes the Finnish people originated from Java, and subsequently went on a journey from there to Egypt, and lived there until Roman times where a portion of them went to Finland, and settled there after a painful and horrific travel. These theories have taken the appeal of former Kekkonenists, who believe that the national myth of Finno-Ugrianism is far too... un-authentic, and lacks the true feeling that is given by Aspa's ideas, which have many facts described in his linguistical books that have become far too impossible to deny for many. Therefore, Aspa now rules unopposed in Helsinki, which he plans on renaming soon."

We now must re-establish connections with Egyptian scholars that hate Arabism like us, such as Taha Hussein and will be willing to support us in the fight for Egyptian National Rejuvenation.

fin.1.desc:0 "Finland has been part of Russia for more than 130 years, and it shows - we have had an increasing number of Russians come to Finland and colonize places like Viipuri and Helsinki, and subsequently the name of our administrative cities have been officially changed to the Russian names first, and Finnish names second. \n\n This has resulted in many rebellions, and an especially harsh one in 1905 where the Finns rose up against their Russian masters and nearly succeeded in taking all of Finland, but were harshly put down by the gigantic Russian Imperial Army, subsequently resulting in a harsh regency led by Pehr Evind Svinhufvud af Qvalstad, who was then assasinated a few years later resulting in complete anarchy of Finnish society, where no one knew the allegiance of their countrymen. The nation was practically at a permanent state of civil war, and this resulted in the Russians entering with their Army and subsequently place Franz Albert Seyn as regent of Grand Duke of Finland, appointed by Kolchak. Now Finland sits in a situation of near chaos once more, where even the slightest misstep would result in total loss of the Kolchakocracy present and the social order..."

With every single man thrown into the slaughter in the south, the Petrograd is left undefended. If we take the ancient capital of Russia, we will be able to gain much-needed legitimacy, gain the respect of the army and unite the divided nation. And proclaim ourselves as the Regent of Russia!\nAt the same time, this is indeed a gamble, and it is impossible to predict that might happen for this operation to fail. But inaction sometimes is even worse and could be perceived as a sign of weakness of Seyn's rule."

After many hours, when the sun started to settle, he still had a bottle in his one hand and crumpled report in the other. Frustrated he shouted for his Adjutant but received no answer. He shouted more, but only deafening silence replied to him. Seyn, instead of getting angry, instead felt unease. He left his office and called for his guards. No reply. This was the moment then Grand Duke began to panic. He was running around his residence, screaming, begging for his servants. Tired, breathless, he slowly settled in his chair. He tried to deny, the scary thought at the back of his mind but now he understood. The horrifying realization entered his mind when he looked in the window. Two columns of soldiers were marching in his direction. He wanted to reach for the revolver, but was unable to move, all strength left his body. When soldiers entered his office and stated that 'he was accused of treason and was under arrest', he did not resist.

Now, after the peaceful protest entered the government palace in Helsinki and local forces loyal to Seyn have defected more and more, it seems that Seyn's corruption, oligarchial madness and nonsensical choices in the past have finally come up to him.

What once was like a sleeping bear, waiting for its chance to strike and devour us whole, is now more like a quirky uncle who is beloved by the family despite his lack of trustworthiness. Russo-Finnish immigration rates have never been higher, with our people feeling free to roam back and forth between the lands of two new friends. However, there are some vocal critics in both Russia and Finland who believe that this new relationship undermines Russia and Finland’s respective positions in the world. Russians believe that their once-mighty empire is suddenly supplicating itself to a breakaway subject state, and Finns believe that being a Russian lapdog is no better than living under their heels.

Then, slowly he started to realize that what he had in his hands was without doubt one of the greatest things that had happened to the nation during his career as foreign minister. A telegram was sent back to France and Kailas readied to encounter the Pharaoh himself. At eight, he was waiting in the Palace's main hall and ten minutes later a servant showed Kailas the way to the inner chambers of the building. The Pharaoh was enjoying some tea as Kailas entered the room and bowed down before Him. Pharaoh, who didn't like his ministers to show such humbleness cleared his throat and asked what was the reason for this visit, that made Him wake up two hours earlier than usual. Kailas got up and began briefing the telegram to Pharaoh. \nSarkia had found a young Egyptian academic, called Taha Hussein, who was visiting France in an Egyptian futurist delegation. This man had written controversial, yet celebrated works on pre-islamic poetry and critiques of British colonial rule as well as Arab society. Sarkia knew straight away that this man could be of use to us, he could even be sympathetic to our ideas. Sarkia had proposed to Hussein that he should examine the relationship of Coptic languages and Finnish. Hussein, who didn't know anything about Finnish language, was hesitant, but with certain conditions would accept the task. After Kailas was done, there was a moment of silence. At last, Pharaoh spoke and said that Hussein should be provided with everything he wanted, a course in Finnish and funding.\nNot long after twelve, as the answer of Pharaoh was sent, another telegram arrived.

fin.88.desc:0 "With Franz Albert Seyn now gone, Finland is now free to hold its first fair and free national election! Three front runners have emerged from the most popular democratic parties, namely Kyösti Kallio from the liberal Agrarian League, Juho Kusti Paasikivi from the conservative National Coalition Party, and Väinö Tanner from the Social Democratic Party. Tanner is the frontrunner among the general population, and has managed to woo the upper and lower classes alike with his promises of fairness and equality without the tyranny of councilism. Kallio and Paasikivi have denounced Tanner as a pseudo-Communist, and are targeting support from the middle and upper classes respectively while aiming to beat Tanner in Electoral votes, which seems incredibly likely considering the generally conservative views of the electors. This is a historic moment in Finnish history, one which will be remembered by Finns everywhere for decades to come."

fin.15.desc:0 "Following the Finnish Revolution, as well as Finland’s subsequent ascension to the Third International, the nations of Hungary and Finland have seen a massive increase in friendly relations with one another. This newfound friendship has culminated in the adoption of a treaty which takes their relationship to the next level, adding economic and military cooperation to their shared membership in the Third International. In an official statement, the Finnish government stated, “A little-known fact about Hungary and Finland is that our peoples actually have common history as Uralic tribesmen. Although we Socialists are not overly concerned with ethnicities and the pseudoscience known as ‘race’, socialist internationalism has provided us with an opportunity to explore and celebrate our shared history.” The Hungarians have responded similarly, with overtures of admiration for the versatility of Finland against the Russian juggernaut. Some of the more nationalistic party members in both nations have expressed concerns that too much co-dependence will erode both Finnish and Hungarian national identities, which are vital to protect in the face of Russian and Austrian imperialism respectively. However, the two governments have assured their people that they are dedicated to national self-determination, and that cooperation will only strengthen the two peoples."

'What is it?' \n Subsequently he said, 'What do you need?'. Then his liege handed over some papers... \n\n After some time reading, the King realised that his inaction over the past few months regarding his local population has caused immense need for power to be given to him, otherwise Parliamentarians will destroy the country from within!
