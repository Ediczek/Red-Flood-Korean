The recluse mountains of the little statelet have brought many travelers, seeking adventure and spiritual enlightenment in the recluse mountains of this mystical country. Indeed, this land is shrouded in an occult mist – where the ancient legends still walk alive and the shadow of the sacred peak of Belukha always reminds the locals and travelers about the secret world of spirits."

ALT_greataltaicrevolution_desc:0 "As the spirits bless us, and the mountain of Belukha’s white top melts we have craved ourselves a homeland, free of oppressors and invaders! Through our work, the nation of Oirot shall again see a future of wealth and greatness! Vultures may surround us, but we shall stay valiant - in love of our land and our freedom. We call on the heavens to smite the tsarist dogs!"
ALT_the_danger:0 "위험"
ALT_the_danger_desc:0 "Many threats surround our young republic. The claws of the Russian two-headed eagle, the accursed Baron and the Siberian governor, try to reap the living flesh of our nation and turn us into slaves again. But something greater seems to be happening inside our domain. Shamans speak of bad omens befaling upon Gurkin, avengers of the black spirits plotting a conspiracy to cast down the White kingdom. An electric fizzle lingers in the air - and soon there will be thunder."

#Gurkin
ALT_gurkhin_prevails:0 "구르킨이 승기를 쥐다!"
ALT_gurkhin_prevails_desc:0 "It is only natural and in accordance with the general nature of things that it is Grigory Choros-Gurkin who leads us in the coming struggle against the Russian Eagle. He is not only a true Altaian through blood and birth, but has also been the captain of our besieged statelet for the past arduous decade. From the gilded art academies at the heart of the Empire to years of exile in Siberia, Gurkhin won the nectar of the Tsars thanks to his delicate talent, and won hard labor in the cold thanks to his zealous defense of our people’s nationhood. When the civil war broke out, he rose to the task and led the Karakorum government as the storm raged on up north, allying our republic with the revolutionaries in exchange for a promise of freedom. Now, with a stronger government and a weaker Empire, the holy men beat the war drums with ever-increasing intensity, urging us to take what’s ours once and for all. This war is not only against invaders and colonizers, but against demons from within and outside, a sacred exorcism of the whole steppe. A steppe that must belong to us, by blood and incense!"
ALT_milk_white_faith:0 "순백의 신앙"
ALT_milk_white_faith_desc:0 "Over three decades ago, great augurs were presented to our people. A mighty white horse was seen galloping across the starry night sky by a young girl and her father, who went on to proclaim with peasant simplicity but divine piety a new truth: that the coming of Oirot, the Master of the Altay, and the immediate liberation from Russia was inevitable. Their followers, devout of this creed that is pure as milk and snow, spread the good news far and wide across the nation. Persecuted and beaten but never forgotten, the followers of the spirit Burkhan have endured many wicked attacks. It is the mark of the Altaic race and our distinction from all other Asiatic tribes, and so it is the duty of Gurkin’s confederacy to make every man and woman aware of the great message so that we may move on to fulfill the promises of Oirot as soon as possible."
ALT_deal_with_sukhbaatar:0 "수흐바아타르 처리"
ALT_deal_with_sukhbaatar_desc:0 "The rolling wine-red dunes of the Gobi host a legion of armed fighters that no army has yet defeated. These warriors are the Mongolian People’s Army, the men who have tirelessly fought against imperialists from north and south with resolve and bravado all these years. Even if we don’t align with their exceptionally exalted Bolshevik tendencies, they are a most natural friend in the region when one considers our shared goals of national liberation for our respective peoples. Cooperation based in mutual respect and shared responsibilities must be our foremost aim in our diplomacy with the reds. And so we shall say to Commander Sukhbaatar: to the liberators of the Mongol peoples, we salute you!"
ALT_conservative_socialism:0 "보수사회주의"
ALT_conservative_socialism_desc:0 "Our socialism is not the Bolshevik revolutionary craze of our companions to the east nor a lukewarm reformism for accommodative elites. We understand socialism as a vital principle of justice and improvement of the self in a world determined by survival of the fittest. Socialism means to break the shackles of foreign despots and devious oligarchs within, so that the whole of the Altay may live a fulfilling life. The bounds that hold us firmly to the earth so that we may not get lost in the vast darkness of the endless revolutionary night are not oxidized chains, but rather the principle of conservation of our way of life and ancestral laws. These two principles, socialization and conservation, are the backbone of our regime, and it is time we put them into practice, sweeping across the nation like a storm."
ALT_destroy_superstition:0 "미신 분쇄"
ALT_destroy_superstition_desc:0 "Under the shadow of the great mountains and inside damp, dark caves, sinister spirits fester and reproduce in great numbers. Their nests where they are born and mature are none other than the fetid mouths of the so-called black shamans, a caste of devil worshippers that terrify the population with their stories of terrible magic and obscurantist folklore. This open and savage defiance of enlightenment is contrary not only to our faith but to reason, and such practices must be condemned and persecuted if we wish for the Altay to have any future. To get rid of superstition, death to shamans, and war against the spirit world will be our war cries in this elemental siege against darkness."
ALT_fulfill_the_prophecies:0 "예언 실현"
ALT_fulfill_the_prophecies_desc:0 "Many centuries ago there was a Khan Oirot, who ruled in an idyllic domain and protected the poor and innocent. Then, the enemies of the Altaic tribes attacked, and one after another Oirot was unable to defend his own people. With a deep sadness he was forced to depart in frustration and bitterness, but to his subjects he made a promise: that he would one day return, sent by the High God Burkhan, to fulfill his purpose and save the Altay mountains once and for all. Now, the glaciers are moving up high in the mountains. Farmers claim a larch tree has grown big enough to cover a whole regiment with its leaves. The omens do not lie. It is self-evident that he has already returned and that the tribulations will end swiftly, as we are under the loving care of Oirot incarnate, who is none other than our admired Gurkin."
ALT_banish_the_invaders:0 "침략자 격퇴"
ALT_banish_the_invaders_desc:0 "Pathetic statelets have feasted on the rotting corpse of Mongolia for long enough. These maggots came from north and south to devour alive our nation and perpetuate the cycles of tyranny their homelands subjected our people to. The Chinese lord over their own military clique from which they harass their own countrymen in their petty infighting. Along the shores of the Baikal, the decadent cossack-king enjoys the spoils of his bandit realm in degenerate opulence. Far to the west, the worst of them all: a man from a faraway land possessed by a demon, who by dark magic has gathered many hordes under his banner and tricked many aristocrats into joining him. With our People’s Army allies, the beheading of this three-headed monster will be swift and brutal, and the steppe free once more for its one and true sons to live in peace at."
ALT_protect_our_way_of_life:0 "우리의 생활방식 수호"
ALT_protect_our_way_of_life_desc:0 "Throughout millenia, there has been a clear and definite way of doing things. Our national costume, our wedding traditions, our way of giving thanks to our brethren, this is the Altay Jan, the ordering principle of our daily lives. There also exists a higher and ancient ritualism that impregnates the Ak-Jan, the highest and most pure expression of our religious sentiment. The laws that govern the wild and starry sky as well as the most common of our sentiments must be safeguarded against harmful influences, enshrined in our customary laws and politics. If it is said that a nation without law is but a corpse waiting to be picked apart, we then must fight lawlessness wherever we see it."
ALT_general_land_reform:0 "The General Land Reform"
ALT_general_land_reform_desc:0 "Across the titian plains and the blue mountains of our republic there exists a most unfortunate situation. Great clans dominate grand stretches of rich land that they use and abuse to their heart’s desire, while poor families and itinerant shepherds have to pay exorbitant taxes for even standing on their grass. This completely unjust land distribution has also brought to attention an equally dire problem: our agricultural output is abysmal, going even below subsistence levels in rough seasons of the year. The government’s hand must urgently intervene, radically reorganizing land allotment. We will break these enormous feuds by force if necessary, leaving them as common property with universal usufruct for all farmers and hunters of our steppe. The earth has no owner but Burkhan, and no guardian but our Republic."
ALT_reform_the_priesthood:0 "사제단 개혁"
ALT_reform_the_priesthood_desc:0 "Even if a certain number of shamans have accepted enlightening ideas and in good faith spread their religion to the common folk, they are sadly still harmful to the wider Altaic nationhood and are in desperate need of reform. Disgusting and shameful practices such as animal sacrifices are sadly still widespread. We have to go away with the antiquated and oppressive shamanic caste and promote the healthy alternative of our creed: storytellers. One can only answer the question “what am I to do?” if one answers beforehand “of which stories do I find myself a part of?” This epic wisdom of ours is not only a purely religious creed, but rather an affirmation of our nationhood and the right to declaim our own myths, told for us by us, and not by an oppressive estate of secretive spellcasters."
ALT_pan_oirot_state:0 "범오이로트 국가"
ALT_pan_oirot_state_desc:0 "For much of our history we’ve been the fringe of the world, a no man’s land between the Whites and Yellows to carve and divide at their leisure. Our own peoples used to say that they “did not know whether they came to this land to live or to die”. A people without glory who only know misery and toil, how has the just tide of history changed! From a crumbling tribal statelet, we’ve succeeded through the trials and tribulations of war and emerged a true power over the steppes and mountains. The Pan-Oriot state, the nation of the Kalmyks, is now a reality, and we know we will defend our liberty and sovereignty whatever the cost."
ALT_build_national_identity:0 "민족정체성 건설"
ALT_build_national_identity_desc:0 "Every step we’ve taken along this journey, every deep breath we’ve taken before continuing on, every mountain overcome and bullet shot, every law passed and commandment written has been for one purpose and one purpose only: to build a nation. Forging an identity out of tribes is an arduous and seemingly impossible task, but we have hope. We are now united under one faith carefully constructed to birth trueborn Altaians, with common symbols of identity and tradition, under one language, and one leader: the Father of the Fatherland, Grigory Gurkin."
ALT_oirot_national_church:0 "오이로트 국립교회"
ALT_oirot_national_church_desc:0 "We can’t forever depend on itinerant tale-tellers if we are to survive, and so even our most sacred doctrines must revitalize themselves with energy and discipline. The Oirot National Church shall be created for this very purpose, to carefully host our creed and our faithful under one name. This organization won’t be like the decadent and stratified churches of the Russians, but it shall certainly serve to properly disseminate our truth with a certain degree of sophistication, making our conversion of the Altay mountains all the more efficient."
ALT_aid_the_russian_brothers:0 "우리의 러시아인 형제들 구호"
ALT_aid_the_russian_brothers_desc:0 "A promise made is a promise kept, as the word of our people is sacred in nature. Honor demands we rally to the support of the Republic of Yellow Russia, the renegades and downtrodden that hate the White tyranny as much as we do. To them we tied our fate back in the Russian Civil War, and our survival is still shared with their ultimate victory. In exchange for minor land concessions and population exchanges to avoid future chaos and border disputes, the Republicans will guarantee our sovereignty and nationhood and aid us against any foreign threats, and we will provide them with what little military and economic support we may give them in these decisive times."
ALT_democracy_and_tradition:0 "민주정과 전통"
ALT_democracy_and_tradition_desc:0 "The disenfranchised and forgotten among our people have the natural and deserved right to participate in their own government and to make their voice heard across the whole country. The setting up of voting booths, whole legions of bureaucrats, many information campaigns, and proper administrative lines to connect even the most remote villages will be hard, but the liberation of every peasant is worth any and all sacrifices necessary."
ALT_harmony_in_karakorum:0 "카라코룸 안의 조화"
ALT_harmony_in_karakorum_desc:0 "Hark and listen, traveler, here comes the sweet buzzing of bees and the gentle clop of sheep hooves! Hear the whispering wind across craggy mountaintops, the gutural song of peasants, and the neighing of wild horses! Do you not realize? Do you not know? Here comes the Golden Altay, the land of Eternal Summer! Unbound, unbent, unbroken, unbeaten! Glory to the liberators of the nation, honor to Choros-Gurkin, and long live the republic!"

From the shadows, emerges the true vanguard of the greatest revolution the world has ever witnessed - the United Labour Brotherhood. The enlightened ones of our brotherhood have found a new wisdom that shall make the world young again - that there is no contradiction between the fire that burns in the heart of the revolutionary and the adept, that both the alchemist and the proletarian worship one god - and that god is labour. We announce that our Great Work has just begun! The fire of the barrels of our guns is one and the same as the flame of alchemical furnaces, and with it we will achieve the greatest transmutation. From the lead of Altay we will arrive at the sublime gold of Communism."

Under his counsel, we shall work for the spiritual awakening of all humanity – creation of a new, enlightened and prosperous land in harmony with the ancient wisdom of Tradition."

Our just war shall not be limited to the world of men, but we will conquer the world of ghosts and spirits! Let occult powers tremble, for the light of Prometheus comes again to chain them and leash them like animals!"
ALT_universal_rythm:0 "보편된 박자"
ALT_universal_rythm_desc:0 "It is the most profound mystery of the occult art, that is beginning to be understood by scientists, that the world is composed of vibrations of the Great Spirit. These vibrations fill the entire world with a divine presence, animating and bringing life and meaning into the dead dust of matter. These manifest themselves in a secret rhythm, a code of divine music. Understanding of this code will allow us to work wonders by merely a correct rhythm of our actions. The vibrations of the Universe shall be taken into account by engineers, architects, artists, scientists and even workers to remake life, to make us all united in a mystical communion. Everything in our revolution will be in tune with the beating of God's heart!"
ALT_socialist_synarchy:0 "Socialist Synarchy"
ALT_socialist_synarchy_desc:0 "Wrong are those who equate socialism with struggle! Where is the social spirit in the wrath and hatred of class struggle? Is there a true love for our brothers and the sweetness of our labour in the foaming jaws of the lynching mob? The true essence of socialism is Synarchy – an organic union of everyone with everyone. Our workers will be organised into syndicates that will represent their craft in the Congress of Soviets. Above them, a class of red priests, entirely dedicated to upholding harmony in the state will mediate and govern the unions – so we will all be united in one perfect body, a true reflection of the heavenly order on Earth."

ALT_embrace_shamanism_desc:0 "The beating of the shaman's drum opens the doors to a new world, full of wonders and unimaginable powers, the ancient and venerable rite of the Altaic tribes contains a most revolutionary element! We shouldn't stay arrogant in our "civilized" teachings, but watch and study closely the words and rites of the wise men of our citizens. It is known to us that their tradition retains the parts of the Sunny Science of ancient Agartha, fossilized in the mystical aura of the great Belukha. Let the dance of the revolution begin!"

ALT_retrieve_golden_science_desc:0 "In the days before history, a great empire of Shambhala-Agartha ruled the world – they lived in the most perfect form of communism, in harmony of matter and spirit. Their wisdom in all sciences created wonders our age is only beginning to approach. But as the West restores the material part of ancient knowledge, it risks a catastrophe, forgetting to develop the spirit as well. Indeed, the Aghartans knew of another science than the doctors and engineers of today – the Solar Science, Golden Science, that spoke of great mysteries beyond the veil of the material world. This science has survived in parts in occult orders, and the profound traditions of the East. It is our task and responsibility, to gather the parts of the Solar Science and restore it to the heights it saw before aeons!"

Many old sages said that this world will remain dark to us to the end of time, for our minds simply cannot comprehend it. We reject this weak humility! With the sharp pincers of science, we're going to dissect all that was said to be occulted. Every ghost, every monster of the woods, every legend, every god's temple and every sorcerous spell, will be cracked open. Finally, we will reconcile the profound materialist science with the wonder of the spiritual world – by bringing the latter into the chains of technics and measurement. We carry a light that knows no mercy – and nothing will escape it!"

We will place all the notable archaeological sites and secret laboratories under the direction of the service. In its professional clutch, we will learn of new ways to break the enemies of our coming State."

ALT_secret_priesthood_desc:0 "The class of priests has the greatest responsibility in our society - not only they hold the keys to governance, but before all they’re the keepers of the occult knowledge bestowed upon us. It is blasphemous to think we can bestow all the secrets of the Universe and divinity for every peasant - no! Keeping with the unbroken sacred tradition of secret rites, our priesthood will be a mystery cult in the shape of the Masons, with degrees of initiation and a program of ritual study. Only the golden souls will be able to enter it, and raise their spirits to divine perfection that our entire State strives towards."

Combining the wisdom of the West and the East, along with the finest scientific insight, a new school of mysticism was born. One that transcends the individualism usually found in this practice – and instead allows the ego to dissolve in the great life of the all-encompassing collective. This new doctrine was compiled into a book by the name of Red Star Tantra – and we will make sure it's published and distributed everywhere our government reaches."

The metaphysical forces of reaction, in fear of our great spiritual revolution, have manifested into this man and given him a mission to crush the new humanity in its embryo! He will not be defeated until we exorcise his spirit from the land – with the help of shamans our bullets shall bite the accursed tyrant's armies like wasps, and his wrathful ghost will never visit the sacred steppes again!"

Only boring reports from border provinces and long-winded arguments about the pitiful state of the Altaic administration were heard. President Gurkin himself sometimes looked towards the clock on the wall, awaiting the much-desired break. \n\nThen, suddenly - a thunder-like roar broke the silence. A gunshot! The delegates all stood up alarmed. The ragtag militias that composed the parliament guards were already shouting and ringing their alarm bells. Before any of the gathered politicians could make sense of this situation, the battle was already raging.  \n\nA group of men, recognised by their high caps with a red star on it surrounded the building, hidden behind makeshift barricades. Behind them, more soldiers, many footmen and some horsemen were preparing to strike. The government guards took positions on the windows, but the Heavens seemed to favour the bullets of the Bolsheviks, as three men were already laying in puddles of blood. \n\nLooking with the corner of his eye, Gurkin recognised the leader of this criminal putsch - none other than Gleb Bokii, a charlatan, swindler, rebel and to this time a loyal ally of the Confederation. He knew Bokii had no scrupules to deal with his enemies - but he also wasn’t needlessly cruel. If the parliament raised the white flag, he, and his people would surely be spared. The time to make a decision was fleeting. Will Gurkin sacrifice his dream of a free Altai to save his life, or will he play on the risky card and try to repeal the overwhelming attack?"

The hall that was so quiet just a few moments before, was filled with the hubbub of the Bolshevik soldiers, loudly talking and shouting revolutionary slogans. \n\nBut, silence reigned again when Bokii entered the speaker’s podium, beginning his fiery, if chaotic, speech. \n\n\"Comrades! Brothers! Faithful! The mystery of History unravels before us! The gates of this palace opened before us, as we trampled on the remains of the old order - but this is only the beginning of our work. Therefore, I proclaim a new state to be created in the place of the Confederation of Altai - the Altaic People’s Republic!

He grabbed the arm of a guard rushing to a window to return fire, shouting at him to use the chimney of one of the Duma’s backrooms to make a smoke signal. The man returned shortly saying there was no firewood. Gurkin cursed this backwater country, nothing seemed to go right here. He even gave a moment’s more consideration to surrendering before turning to the stenographer and ripping the useless minutes of the meeting off his desk, pushing them into the guard’s hands, shouting, \"This’ll do!\" With that parchment and a broken up chair, a smoke signal was given. Now it was time to hold down the fort. \n\nFat parliamentarians picked up the guns of young fallen soldiers. Tribal leaders whipped out pistols which by Duma laws were not previously permitted. Reinforcements were spotted from the city garrison, and the Bolsheviks began to taste defeat. Bokii considered one last attack before bitterly turning his back and ordering his men to reform rank and turn heel for a retreat. A running battle ensued in which many of the Bolshevik infantrymen were run down and captured. \n\nGurkin smiled as workers came in to repair the Duma, and the detained rebels were escorted to prison, perhaps he’d be merciful and negotiate for their release to end the conflict for good. Perhaps even they deserve to taste the fruits of a free Altai."

alt.16.title:0 "뿔피리의 소리와 함께"
alt.16.desc:0 "One of the battles with Ungern Sternberg's bandits was ongoing. The terror that was unleashed during that battle was indescribable. As cruel as the Mad Baron was, his men rejoiced at tearing their victims to shreds as if they were wild beasts hunting their prey. Sternberg’s name was surrounded with such hate and fear that no one could judge what was the truth and what was false, what was history and what myth. One thing was certain, however. There must be an end to this madness and the self-proclaimed Genghis Khan. The red soldiers fiercely resisted the onslaught of Sternberg's men, but many began to panic as they saw the advance of the savage cavalry heading towards them, setting off clouds of dust that rose into the air. For most of the soldiers, they looked like demons, and those of lesser faith wondered if it was time to start running and counting that the divine punishment inflicted by these half-demons would not reach them. \n\nOn a nearby hill, a slanting shaman with a dark, wrinkled face stared at the whole spectacle. Behind him he heard a cynical and slightly nervous voice. \"Situation doesn’t look the best. Doesn’t it? Your plan sounds strange, great leader! I'm not sure how the horns and your singing are going to help us win the battle. But we prepared the tubes.\" \n\nIt was Captain Ivanovich, who was getting impatient because his people, instead of fighting, were laying big trumpets so that a few monks and shamans could sing their chants. The shaman turned. His hair, black as night, blew in the breeze with his tousled robe. He said as he approached Ivanovich and the trumpets. \n\n\"A great spirit is patient and unhastly  in his actions. Wait patiently and you will see the sweet fruits of victory.\" \n\nIvanovich got out of his way and the shaman went to the trumpets. After a short while, those like him joined him, who also sat down and, meditating, began to sing their holy incantations in a language that the Russians did not understand. They also started to play the drums and rattle the knockers to create as much noise as possible. Ivanovich raised an eyebrow and lit a cigarette waiting for effects of the Shaman’s plans. He didn’t need to wait long, quickly his adjutant ran up to him and shouted. \n\n\"Captain Ivanovich! Chaos reigns among the enemy!\" \n\n\"What?! What the fuck do you mean by that?\" \n\nAnd they started to play the drums and rattle the knockers to create as much noise as possible. As the shamans began to sing Mongolian, much of Sternberg's cavalry consisting of the Mongols began to get lost. The Russians heard only ominous sounds that they did not understand and spread throughout the valley. The Mongols, on the other hand, heard the voices of their fathers cursing them and announcing their doom. Some of Sternberg's men withdrew and others wanted to continue to fight, so they started to run into each other and trample each other. At the same time, the command of the horde on their old poorly coded radios also began receiving strange messages forming themselves into shaman incantations. The chaos in the organization made it impossible to remedy the chaos on the battlefield. Ivanovich dropped his cigarette to the ground in surprise that the Shaman’s plan worked, then he shouted to the adjutant who stood waiting for further guidance. \n\n\"What are you waiting for!? Call in artillery backup and fuck these motherfuckers to pieces so that their mothers won’t be able to recognize their bodies!\" The adjutant ran towards the artillery position without waiting any longer and after a while the remnants of Sternberg's troops on the battlefield were smashed with artillery shells, tearing their bodies into shreds. The battle has been won, but can the same be said of the war?"

There is no more wretched soul than the soul of the bourgeoisie as it’s consumed by the greed that forces it to accumulate gold that will be lost after he dies. A self destructive manner that brings nothing more but cruelty for your neighbor. Let Heaven abhor the bourgeoisie!\"  Said the Red Army man, spreading his hands in front of the crowd of other soldiers and shamans. In one hand he was holding a copy of Marx's Capital. His hair was gray and he was quite old. His eyes began to turn gray - he went blind. However... He was not dismissed from the army, but transferred to the propaganda corps.He began to go blind after the bullet hit him, his eyes turned red and then he fell. His soldiers said that he began to speak in tongues, and he himself that during his sleep and torpor, he had a vision in which he met Karl Marx. He told him to praise his word, and to continue to preach it to the people. Some thought he was just a weirdo and some took him seriously. With the consent of the party, he organized a meeting with the shamans who wanted to meet him on hearing rumors of his extraordinary talent for speaking with spirits. \n\n\"Come closer my children! Come closer!\" \n\nShamans and soldiers approached the old man, waiting for what he would say next. Still holding Capital, he raised a finger and said. \n\n\"Sit in a circle and curse capitalism together!\" \n\nAnd he sat down, crossing his legs and leaning the book against them. The shamans sat down with him, grabbing their hands with him and with each other, and the soldiers were a little more reluctant to do so. Old man said start speaking again, closing his blind eyes. His Red Army uniform and the red star stood faintly in the pale flame of the candles. \n\n\"O spirits of earth and heaven! Forests and seas! How do the demons of greed destroy you and take advantage of you! O great steppes upon which the wild horses of the mad baron and the hideous monarchists curse them! Bring your wrath on them! Let any animal that bites the enemy of the people be infested with disease. May each day be a wandering devastating for them! Let every crossing of the river in the rain when the rivers are at their most rapid ... Oh ghosts! Oh ghosts! Help us in our mission as we are true servants of people and of the earth…\"  \n\nThe shamans began to repeat after him and the soldiers softened - their souls ceased to be full of skepticism, but opened up. They began timidly echoing the shamans until the whole hall was filled with their prayers for victory over capitalism. The words began to form a melody, and they all began to meditate, wanting to curse capitalism and its minions in the name of Marx and the spirits of the world."

alt.18.desc:0 "The Temple of Saint Macarius had been empty for a long time. Prayers were forbidden in it and most Orthodox Christians went to private homes to pray to their God. The onlookers stopped coming to it as well. There was no one who could make sure that the gilded icons stopped collecting dust and the doors were well oiled and did not creak. However ... Something has changed for some time. Every night when the Triple Goddess shone brightest in the sky and shone brightly in the valley of tears and despair, a small crowd would gather in the temple in absolute silence and one by one. It was the same now. A young man dressed in a dark red robe entered the Church causing the wailing door to groan - this was a signal to the rest of the congregation that the time of initiation had come. Likewise, middle-aged or even gray-enriched men stood around a painted red star on the floor and candles that gave a dim light. The wise men were dressed in similar dark red robes, but adorned with golden stars, from which the light reflected in a similar way as from once-dust free icons. The chairman of the assembly raised his head, adorned with five golden stars - on the head, sleeves, torso and back. The sixth was hung around his neck in the form of an amulet. He spoke to the intimidated young man. \n\n\"You are entering a realm of Human brotherhood, a realm of the sublime spirit that will bring humanity to the new age and new levels of soul. Embrace yourself and humble yourself! Are you ready to join our holy mission in spirit and in the physical realm?\"  The young man stood at a distance from the red star and said, gaining self-confidence and breathing in the air. He said confidently. \n\n\"Yes I am, older brother.\" \n\n\"Your heart is full of fervor and your eyes are keen and eager to know the deepest mysteries of the spiritual world. You have fulfilled your task by tracking down the former guardian of this place, who served Jesus Christ but not the socialist spirit. You have shown that you are ready to act in the physical world, but are you ready to attain enlightenment in the spirit world by following the perilous path of the left hand?\" \n\n\"Yes I am, older brother.\" \n\n\"So I am asking you a third time - which means infinity. Are you ready to join our brotherhood?\" \n\n\"Yes I am, Older Brother\" \n\n\"Then rejoice! As you will be reborn as a new man for eternity. Stand in the center of the star and raise your left leg as a symbol of Netzah, a victory of Human beings over the wicked earthly realm, raise your right hand as a symbol of Gevurah, a strength of the human beings will to overcome its adversities. If you will endure our joyful singing you will be accepted, but if you do not manage to hold your position until the end of the sacred cantations you will offend the world of spirit and be banished forever as you swore for forever.\" \n\nDespite the threat heralded by the failure of the final trial, the young man did not chicken out, but entered the circle and immediately assumed a pose. The hooded sages grasped each other's arms together and began the sacred chantings by dancing around the young man. The ceremony lasted quite a long time and the young man felt that he would slowly not be able to stand in such a position as his leg began to suffer. Finally, however, the circle stopped and the Older Brother came out again, drawing threads and a golden star from under his robe, approaching the young man, who was still standing in this position, sewed it on to him and said happily. \n\n\"Brother! You were dead, but you got up and live! After this time, you feel the limitations of your earthly body, but do not be afraid as it is only temporary and the glory of the human spirit is eternal! You are officially a member of Ordo Fratrum Humanae et Stellae Rubrum. Rejoice! Rejoice!\" He embraced the young man and pressed him to his chest, and the young man hugged him back. The rest of the assembly also rejoiced and began to cheer for the new novice."

alt.19.desc:0 "Status: Still in the test phase \n\nResearch method: Experiment 2273 should be conducted in strict confidence, and test objects should be selected from among the recruits with the highest classification note. First of all, we are looking for young men (18-25 years old) without any genetic disease or damage to the body that could change the test result (including visual impairment). The substances needed for research should be tested first on less important objects in order not to lose valuable assets. \n\nDescription: Experiment 2273 is an element of project: \"Bogatyr\" which tries to find a way to create Super Soldiers with the use of narcotic substances and experimental technologies or methods that could improve the combat effectiveness of soldiers as well as their condition. Experiment 2273 primarily focuses on studying people's resistance to extreme conditions, including sleep deprivation, the body's response to technology, organ transplants, or high levels of adrenaline, etc. \n\nLog of tests: \n\nTest number 008: The eighth test was to examine people's endurance against sleep deprivation, six test subjects were given high doses of adrenaline and caffeine (in a non-life-threatening manner). \n\nThe test was unsuccessful. Most of the test subjects are dead and the two survivors are in critical condition. Two days after the start of the experiment, Captain Esmond Afanasievich began to show enormous levels of aggression towards other participants in the experiment, which resulted in the death of one (artery rupture) and concussion of the other. Captain Afnasievich has been terminated and the critical object is hospitalized. The rest of the subjects began to die of exhaustion, showing disturbing signs of psychosis. It was decided to end the test. \n\nTest number 060: The Sixtieth Test was to investigate whether it is possible to transplant organs such as the heart or the brain, which could save the lives of many soldiers on the battlefield and speed up medical research. Animal testing has been partially successful and human experiments have been attempted. \n\nThe test was partially successful. Death of all objects. It has not been possible to transfer the human brain to a body other than the body from which the organ was obtained, nor has it been possible to transfer the brain into any machine that could keep it alive. However, doctors noted that the heart tests were much more successful as they managed to transfer a fresh heart from a recently deceased donor to a soldier who was shot in an organ during a patrol. However, we sadly note that after several hours of operation, the subject died from a blood type conflict. It is believed that a successful heart transplant is possible. More research is required. \n\nTest number 610: The six hundred and tenth test was carried out to focus on the impact of technology on the human body. Comrade Major Alexei Belitrov volunteered for the experiment. His previous hand was separated from him at the battlefield. He was equipped with a prosthesis enriched with greater clamping force thanks to hydraulic pistons. The major is alive and well but regrets that he cannot feel his new hand and sometimes he notices experiences from his "old hand" which is not possible. Several tests were also carried out in which the Major was able to destroy a brick wall, but his maneuverability with a weapon became negligible. Some researchers wanted to try to connect his nerves to a prosthesis, but were refused as it could mean the death of the Major. The major also complained about the weight of the prostheses, so he was given lighter but more functional ones, which were to be adapted to the handling of weapons, the tests turned out to be successful. Detachment from Experiment 2273 is being considered to create a separate project \"Flesh That Hates\". \n\n-Dr.Volkhvov of Special OGPU Department "
