Therefore, we are given greater liberty at the cost of greater responsibility: the supply of the entire far-eastern zone of operations of the Intermarium depends on Siberia's compliance.\n\nThe United States of Siberia has a good chance of becoming a prosperous state amidst this icy wilderness, but for the time being the Pepelyayev administration has to deal with the partisan problem. There is no rest for the wicked, and both the radicalized Esers and the Black Hundreds are hard at work with sabotage. Railway infrastructure is blown up time after time, and convoys heading eastwards are exposed to attacks by guerrilla bands. \n\nOne day, these terrorist movements might finally die down as the exhausted holdouts will lose hope of reclaiming their homeland and will return to their respective families. For the time being, these \"cursed soldiers\" are annoying flies that constantly buzz by Siberia's ear; noble people alone do not find their way into this cursed ice desert. Józef Kuraś and Zygmunt \"Łupaszka\" Szendzielarz, Polish wartime commanders and overseer of massacres in the East, both roam the countryside alongside several lesser cadres. Already, gangs of soldiers have begun to take advantage of the chaotic situation, seeking profit from robbing civilians or even the outposts of their own brothers in arms. Many things do not change, and Siberia remains the same: a place of imprisonment for all scoundrels and social rejects."

Writers and intellectuals look outside to see policemen shooting innocent people, and slowly but surely more discontent appears around every corner. Illusions of autonomy, Illusions of economic prosperity and illusions of appeal to tradition have lost their appeal in the eyes of the many peoples of Siberia. But no, this does not matter. None of this matters. Governor-General came to Novosibirsk after leaving his dacha and went to a podium, placing down a microphone and preparing speakers, waiting for the crowd to show up. As they huddled around in the cold, the Governor-General began to proclaim: \n \"Subjects of Holy Russia! We have now been given, by the pure and guiding, gentle hand of Petrograd, extensive autonomies which I will list now.\" \n It didn't matter, of course. He was immediately interrupted by an angry mob. This mob, distracting him, did not notice the gunman in their midst who subsequently began to shoot at the Governor-General. Of course, the gunman was immediately annihilated and made into mist, but Almazov was grazed in the shoulder by a bullet, and so he was huddled back to his car. Subsequently, several areas across Siberia, hearing that the Governor-General was shot, immediately declared independence as the Siberian People's Republic and subsequently several smaller soviets were integrated into the larger People's Republic. With Novosibirsk under siege, it seems that the truth finally came out."

Moscow and its environs have been stricken with especial severity; the declaration of the garrison for Drozdovsky and the symbolic importance of Moscow have conspired to ensure the city cannot escape conflict. With the autumn harvest now very much in jeopardy, peasants from Smolensk, Ryazan, and other regions which are now at the mercy of marching armies and inquisitive ‘procurement officers' have been forced to abandon their homes and seek succor elsewhere. They are joined by a steadily growing flow of war orphans, widows, and displaced workers as the conflict expands.\nAnd so they arrive, caked with the dust of the road. Many of the displaced have struggled to find proper accommodations on the trip; our physicians warn that disease is a significant risk among those who arrived packed in boxcars, and have identified symptoms of exposure in a great many of those who traveled the Trans-Siberian Railroad on flatcars, open to the sky. They are the lucky ones; the refugees now arriving bear horrible stories of those forced to make some portion - or more - of the trip on foot, vulnerable to the deprivations of nomadic savages, wild beasts, and God alone knows what else.\nThese people - our countrymen - need a great many things, but the two most largest exigences are basic nutrition and land for productive resettlement. Thankfully, we have a great abundance of both of these things. Land is plentiful in the (mostly) empty lands of Siberia. The onset of the war has seen the near-total collapse of our overseas grain export market, given the sudden recent difficulties in moving products to St. Petersburg - while this has created an economic mess, it means that food, at least, we have no shortage of."

Already, the press, radio, and publishing houses are flourishing with a freedom of expression that would shock much of the Empire, from minority cultures and music to debates in the public sphere that slowly, cautiously take on a lively tone.\nThere are caveats, of course. Awakening the Russian spirit in this much-abused land is to be an active process. A bureau of clerks and censors watches carefully – for exclusive chauvinisms, for the most retrograde of tsarist orthodoxy, for the communist and democratic subversion that would undermine this more-perfected form of solidarity. The order and the freedom that were brought to this land will be fortified against the rot. Then, when a greater consciousness is achieved, the Solidarist program will be as natural to the Russian people as the air they breathe."

After all, he had not been beaten for weeks, and he was given food regularly. He started to see some new faces. The old guards who woke him up with a bucket of icy water in the winter, have disappeared. The new guards gave him a blanket for the nights and seemed to have sympathized with him for some reason. He was thrown in jail for his anti-Kolchak statements, so he expected to live the rest of his life here in Aszino prison, but ever since he turned to God, he felt that getting freed was no longer a delusion.\nHis prayer was cut in half by the noise of the opening cell door. A young guard stepped in, carrying a lamp and some papers.\n“Pyotr Vorobev, right?”\nPyotr nodded.\n“According to an amendment to today’s law in effect, all convicts convicted of crimes related to the expression of opinion will receive amnesty.” the guard read his papers.\n“Get up, you are a free man,” he added.\nPyotr was speechless. His prayers were heard after all!\nAs he walked through the complex, he got his clothes and papers back. He walked out of Aszino prison and stepped into the streets. He wasn’t alone. A small crowd of former prisoners celebrated nearby. He took a deep breath from the cold night air and stretched his numb arms. As his gaze slid into the sky, he noticed that someone swapped the flag at the top of the prison. The old white-green banner was gone, in its place, a tricolor patterned standard was waving with a weird symbol in its middle.\nHe didn't look at it for long. He had a new life to start."

He hoped it wouldn't come to that. However, it was necessary to somehow establish connections. But not the old ways. Walking ahead of his detachment, he caught himself thinking - will it work?\nAlready approaching the village, he noticed how people in a hurry began to disperse to their homes. Fear? Old habit. Nobody is going to bully anyone. But this deaf, mundane, rural Russia can also be understood.\n\n\"Do not be afraid, people! We have come to you in peace. We have an offer, can you call the headman?\"\n\nPeople, looking at the aliens, noticed something in them. Neither faces nor tunics had been seen before.

He had never seen these before. Rather reminiscent of kepi, not guards caps and not cloth helmets. The headman came closer to them and saw the emblem on their headdresses.\n\n“Who are you lot? Why did you come with this Ukrainian symbol on your hats? What are you, Petliurites? Captured Moscow and now come to take away our grain? Oh, woe to us...”\nArtyom exchanged glances with his associates and laughed.\n“- What kind of Petliurites we are, if you please?”\n“- God knows, the time is now such that you can expect anything.

And so to the thread for a year many bandits want to rob us, we have nothing!”\n“- Listen, let me finish. We want to buy grain from you. We will agree on the price.”\nTikhon was a little taken aback. They came to buy? What's going on at all?! Usually armsmen were coming to take away.\n“- Buy, you say...” - said Tikhon, looking for a catch in the proposal.\n“- That's right, half the amount now, half when we will leave” - reassuringly answered Artyom, feeling how pairs of eyes were looking at him with distrust and apprehension.\nTikhon smacked his lips.\n“- Well, if you're not joking, let's have a seat to discuss it.” - said Tikhon, pointing to the city hall."
