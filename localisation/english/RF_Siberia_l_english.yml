 SIB_one_desc:0 "Liberals and moderate Esers have united under the white-green banner of Siberia, and our newly formed federation is one of the most important components of the Warsaw-led hegemony. Therefore, we are given greater liberty at the cost of greater responsibility: the supply of the entire far-eastern zone of operations of the Intermarium depends on Siberia's compliance.\n\nThe United States of Siberia has a good chance of becoming a prosperous state amidst this icy wilderness, but for the time being the Pepelyayev administration has to deal with the partisan problem. There is no rest for the wicked, and both the radicalized Esers and the Black Hundreds are hard at work with sabotage. Railway infrastructure is blown up time after time, and convoys heading eastwards are exposed to attacks by guerrilla bands.\n\nOne day, these terrorist movements might finally die down as the exhausted holdouts will lose hope of reclaiming their homeland and will return to their respective families. For the time being, these \"cursed soldiers\" are annoying flies that constantly buzz by Siberia's ear; noble people alone do not find their way into this cursed ice desert. Józef Kuraś and Zygmunt \"Łupaszka\" Szendzielarz, Polish wartime commanders and overseer of massacres in the East, both roam the countryside alongside several lesser cadres. Already, gangs of soldiers have begun to take advantage of the chaotic situation, seeking profit from robbing civilians or even the outposts of their own brothers in arms. Many things do not change, and Siberia remains the same: a place of imprisonment for all scoundrels and social rejects."

But from the heart of Siberia, we came to make the National Revolution happen! We will build a new type of the state, where solidarity between all the people of Russia and mutual understanding and cooperation is the rule of law, irrespective of wealth or faith. The new man of Russia has overcome decadent Egoism within himself, in favour of their fellow citizen, absolutely voluntarily, giving himself for the glory of the nation. And now its time for our compatriots to decide, what kind of Russia they want to see."

This is Andrey.\" - Baydalakov said to Trushnovich, who was standing against the wall behind the door with a revolver, who, relieved, returned to the chair on which he was sitting and, taking a new cigarette from his case, lit it.\n \"Good evening, colleagues. I'm sorry for being a little late.\" - Andrey said and sat down on a chair, hanging his tunic on it.\n It was rather hot and cramped in the cabinet, the most trusted people of the Union gathered now after all.\n \"Georgiy Konstantinovich, continue please.\" - Baydalakov said, fingers crossed on the table.\n \"So as I told you. Without going into details, we must negotiate with local industrialists. We can offer some of them to buy out their share from the budget, so we will be less dependent on them in case of unpredictability. Oh yes, and do everything possible from us to enlist the support of as many Siberian workers as possible, regardless of occupation. The action report will be ready tomorrow.\" - Gins expressed his thoughts.\n \"Thanks. Arkady Petrovich, you have the word.\" - Baydalakov turned to the son of Stolypin, with whom he was glad to work.\n \"Colleagues, hitherto we were not such a large group of like-minded people and now we need to prepare for the influx of new, initiative \"eagles\". In the shortest possible time, it is necessary to re-open the \"Posev\" publication and launch radio stations to attract people from all over Russia to our banners. Don't worry, the rules for joining the NTS will be the same as before, the qualification remains unchanged.\" - Stolypin assured his partners.\n \"I, like probably most of those gathered here, share your position, thank you. And now... \"- said Baydalakov, running his eyes over the audience, fixing his gaze on Vlasov.\n \"- Andrey, what do you have?\"\n \"Besides my people, there is a high probability that a significant number of Siberian militarymen will join our cause. Besides, the mobilization of industry as soon as possible will only be to our advantage. As long as Petrograd reacts to our actions, we are expected to be ready.\"\n \"- Good news indeed.

Where did they get them and why?\n\n\"- Grigory Danilovich, what is in these boxes?\" - asked the young corporal Sardov, who had only recently been assigned to logistics work by the new military administration.\n\"- Radio stations, Anton, shortwave.\"\n\" - Are these for spare?\"\n\"- No, the supreme leadership is interested in spreading the ideas of our new state to as many people as possible, we need everyone, wherever they are. Of course, not all will respond, but if at least one is interested, then it will already be worth it. In addition, our \"eagles\" throughout Russia need to have conditions for the presence of a permanent communication channel. We have the bigger stations though but they're not here.\"\n\" - What exactly are we going to do with these?\"\n\" - Deliver to villages and small towns to make people understand what we are and offer cooperation. Well, also to provide educational activities.\"\n\nAnton thought.\n\"- But what if people catch the wrong wave or the receiver falls into the hands of a Moscow or Harbin spy?\"\n- Grigory chuckled, looking at his colleague.\n\n\"- If this happens, so be it. Our deeds will be more eloquent than any words. The people in our time are frightened, \"if the state turns to you, expect trouble\", as they say. And we will show people by our own example that it is possible to live differently. As for spies... this is on the conscience of counterintelligence.\"\n\nThe interlocutors noticed a truck approaching them.\n\"- Okay, turn on the light here, now we will load the boxes.\""

He dreamed that he was carrying a pyramid of crystal dishes on a tray, walking along a rope over an abyss. One awkward movement and his entire burden fell into the darkness with a deafening crack. There was no fear or panic. Only exhausting anxiety, coupled with a sense of personal responsibility, eating from the inside. He is no longer young, and his work is not going to get any easier. Looking at the ceiling at the soothing dance of shadows from the flaming tongues of the fireplace, he closed his eyes and sighed."

Artyom had suspicions about the new government, but he no longer felt that he was beating the thumbs, now he is doing business. And he did not want to use a rifle now. He hoped it wouldn't come to that. However, it was necessary to somehow establish connections. But not the old ways. Walking ahead of his detachment, he caught himself thinking - will it work?\nAlready approaching the village, he noticed how people in a hurry began to disperse to their homes. Fear? Old habit. Nobody is going to bully anyone. But this deaf, mundane, rural Russia can also be understood.\n\n\"Do not be afraid, people! We have come to you in peace. We have an offer, can you call the headman?\"\n\nPeople, looking at the aliens, noticed something in them. Neither faces nor tunics had been seen before. From a two-story wooden house, diverging in length in two directions, a graying man came out, about 50 years old, strong-looking, obviously plowed over a field for hundreds of miles.\nFirst of all, he looked at the caps of those who came. He had never seen these before. Rather reminiscent of kepi, not guards caps and not cloth helmets. The headman came closer to them and saw the emblem on their headdresses.\n\n\"Who are you lot? Why did you come with this Ukrainian symbol on your hats? What are you, Petliurites? Captured Moscow and now come to take away our grain? Oh, woe to us...\"\nArtyom exchanged glances with his associates and laughed.\n\"- What kind of Petliurites we are, if you please?\"\n\"- God knows, the time is now such that you can expect anything. Like you have come here, people. What do you want from our village?\"\n\"- Your grains...\"\nKnowing what the matter was leading to, the headman Tikhon interrupted Artyom.\n\"- We have no grain! And so to the thread for a year many bandits want to rob us, we have nothing!\"\n\"- Listen, let me finish. We want to buy grain from you. We will agree on the price.\"\nTikhon was a little taken aback. They came to buy? What's going on at all?! Usually armsmen were coming to take away.\n\"- Buy, you say...\" - said Tikhon, looking for a catch in the proposal.\n\"- That's right, half the amount now, half when we will leave\" - reassuringly answered Artyom, feeling how pairs of eyes were looking at him with distrust and apprehension.\nTikhon smacked his lips.\n\"- Well, if you're not joking, let's have a seat to discuss it.\" - said Tikhon, pointing to the city hall."

Heroes needed medals for their bravery in trying times, men were to be remunerated for their service in confiscated land, and he was thumbing through a catalog of novel foreign weaponry.\n\nA knock sounded at the door, and Kornilov welcomed the Solidarist leadership inside.\n\n\"Good evening, Governor-General.\"\n\nWith a grin and a gesture to take their seats, Kornilov begins,  \"Welcome, my friends. If I'm not mistaken, this is the first time we've been in the same room since the uprising began. Although last time, the room was my command tent surrounded by horse manure and uncertainty.\" The men took their seats and an assistant took their requests for drinks.\n\n\"We've always had faith in you.\" Vlasov replied, \"But it is a relief to be here, and not in the midst of chaos.\"/n/n\"Well, when this place becomes a Solidarist asset I trust it will be used appropriately.\"\n\n\"I respect the apolitical nature of this-\"\n\n\"Let's dispose of all pretense. I have one last lesson in governance.\" Vlasov nodded, and the men proceeded to the elevator. Turning a key in the panel, they descended deeper into the capitol building. When they emerged they were greeted by walls of concrete, with doors and hatches of iron.\n\n\"This place was built during the Republican turmoil.\" Kornilov stated as the men proceeded through the bunker to its inner chamber. Flanked by rows of lockers filled with guns, ammunition, and explosives was a safe on the back wall. Kornilov opened it in silence, and his guests couldn't help but peer over his shoulder as he lifted out an unmarked box. \"In this box there are enough pills for the head of state, his closest allies, and his family to die with minimal pain.\" the small, wiry Kornilov then threw the box on the ground, and set to stomping out all of its powdery contents. \"I never cowered here, and God willing, neither shall you.\" Looking into Vlasov's steely eyes, Lev smiled."

He is tired, it's all some kind of surrealism that he can't truly comprehend. One thought suddenly dawned on him. Maybe better to listen to the voice of the Siberian Duma?

The exercises were part of a necessary routine. He thought about his position in the future. What if they don't succeed? What if their \"revolution of nationally minded Russian people\" fails? No, the stakes are too high to think about it. But if this gamble pays off, will he be thrown into the backyard for a bogus reason? No, he won't allow that. He wants to be remembered, wants not only to preserve, but even to increase personal power. The Union in the future will put spokes in the wheels, it's a matter of time. However, they may already suspect something themselves and want to keep him on a leash. He needs to find ways, the current situation can bring more opportunities.

Upon the arrival of the police task force, a shootout with an armed group of people ensued. During the battle, one policeman was killed, an Okhrana officer was wounded, three shooters died from their wounds, two were taken into custody and interrogated. The clash took place at an abandoned factory in the vicinity of Barnaul, in which a weapons depot, radiograms and letters were found, which only confirmed the investigation's guesses.\n\nThe testimonies of the interrogated agree - a certain anti-government group, calling itself the \"People's Labor Union of Russian Solidarists\", having connections in the military and political circles of the Governor General, was really preparing a conspiracy. Subsequent operational-investigative measures did not yield results. Perhaps, having learned about the raid, the group lay low."
