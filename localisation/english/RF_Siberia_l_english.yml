Therefore, we are given greater liberty at the cost of greater responsibility: the supply of the entire far-eastern zone of operations of the Intermarium depends on Siberia's compliance.\n\nThe United States of Siberia has a good chance of becoming a prosperous state amidst this icy wilderness, but for the time being the Pepelyayev administration has to deal with the partisan problem. There is no rest for the wicked, and both the radicalized Esers and the Black Hundreds are hard at work with sabotage. Railway infrastructure is blown up time after time, and convoys heading eastwards are exposed to attacks by guerrilla bands. \n\nOne day, these terrorist movements might finally die down as the exhausted holdouts will lose hope of reclaiming their homeland and will return to their respective families. For the time being, these \"cursed soldiers\" are annoying flies that constantly buzz by Siberia's ear; noble people alone do not find their way into this cursed ice desert. Józef Kuraś and Zygmunt \"Łupaszka\" Szendzielarz, Polish wartime commanders and overseer of massacres in the East, both roam the countryside alongside several lesser cadres. Already, gangs of soldiers have begun to take advantage of the chaotic situation, seeking profit from robbing civilians or even the outposts of their own brothers in arms. Many things do not change, and Siberia remains the same: a place of imprisonment for all scoundrels and social rejects."

Illusions of autonomy, Illusions of economic prosperity and illusions of appeal to tradition have lost their appeal in the eyes of the many peoples of Siberia. But no, this does not matter.

We have now been given, by the pure and guiding, gentle hand of Petrograd, extensive autonomies which I will list now.\" \n It didn't matter, of course. He was immediately interrupted by an angry mob. This mob, distracting him, did not notice the gunman in their midst who subsequently began to shoot at the Governor general. Of course, the gunman was immediately annihilated and made into mist, but Almazov was grazed in the shoulder by a bullet, and so he was huddled back to his car. Subsequently, several areas across Siberia, hearing that the governor general was shot, immediately declared independence as the Siberian People's Republic and subsequently several smaller soviets were integrated into the larger People's Republic.

Awakening the Russian spirit in this much-abused land is to be an active process. A bureau of clerks and censors watches carefully – for exclusive chauvinisms, for the most retrograde of tsarist orthodoxy, for the communist and democratic subversion that would undermine this more-perfected form of solidarity.

As his gaze slid into the sky, he noticed that someone swapped the flag at the top of the prison.
