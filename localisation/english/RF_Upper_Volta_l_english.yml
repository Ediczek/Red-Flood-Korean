 UPV_DESC_MENU:0 "France's sudden exit from the Great War was not only felt in the Metropole. In its African colonies, disappointed veterans returned home with no rewards to show for their service. Post-war chaos gave way to anti-colonial agitation, which soon found an ally in the revolutionary movements that would later become known as the FNAG. When the FNAG took over and the colonies were soon thrown into disarray, the young activists of colonial Upper Volta would find leaders in Nazi Boni and Sangoulé Lamizana, founding the first democratic republic in Africa. Two years have passed since, and now the Republic is heading towards the future, under the guidance of its fathers. Will its dreams come true?"
 POLITICS_UPV_nazi_boni:0 "His supporters esteem him as Africa's Artaud, while his opponents insult him as a mere puppet of the new French regime. Nazi Boni, at 27, is the young leader at the helm of Africa's youngest republic, in age and in spirit. Born in the early days of French colonial rule over his homeland, the young Boni became a teacher. Following the footsteps of many other men of his age who sought a change in the colonials' ways, Boni became increasingly involved in radical politics.\n\nThe French disaster in the Great War would bring chaos to their young African colonial empire. Wartime revolts across French Africa were only followed by the mess that Metropole politics became. To the Integralist and Radical Republican governments that held the reins in Paris, the accelerationist Front National d'Avant-Garde became the main voice of discontent with what French politics became. In the colonies, young activists such as Nazi Boni saw in their ideals a model for change in Africa and beyond. The Front also took note of this anti-colonial agitation, forging links from Ouagadougou to Dakar to what would become just a few years later Le Soleil.\n\nThe Rassemblement Démocratique Africain was West Africa's answer to the FNAG. From Dakar to Niamey, this party was the network that brought together a whole generation of native intellectuals, politicians and activists that desired reform, modernisation and freedom. In 1934, the Accelerationists seized power in France proper. The colonies' response was chaotic, leading to a general collapse in authority. Nazi Boni, by now the foremost figure of the Upper Voltan RDA, seized power, proclaiming a new Upper Voltan Republic aligned with the ideals of the new French state. But there was nobody next to Volta to celebrate their independence. In Niamey, Conakry and Bamako, hostile forces toppled RDA attempts at control.\n\nNazi Boni and his government marches forwards to the future, unburdened by what has been. Upper Volta, just like France in Europe, is the beacon of African rejuvenation. Despite the initial setbacks, Boni's visions of a strong and powerful Upper Volta that will one day unite the African continent under the banner of liberty have only grown stronger since 1934. It is only a matter of time, he believes, until he and his movement will leave a lasting mark upon world history."
