 POLITICS_NAZI_BONI_DESC:0 "What introduction can be given to the national hero of Upper Volta, its definer and saviour? His restless work to save Upper Volta from the local brutal colonial remnants in Ouagadougou stemmed not from years of political training, or even contacts in the military; They were from his endless charisma, his adoring and passionate belief in the Upper Voltan people and their future. First a school director in Ouagadougou, Nazi had recognized the unrest in Paris and quickly realized that the opportunity to turn his passive thoughts of becoming a politician was violently and quickly approaching. The colonial remnants fighting against native revolts and futurists were weakening and so with the assistance of a minor corporal in Ouagadougou he nearly instantly became the leading revolutionary figure in the country. Rallying local militias to unite under one banner, he faced one of the hardest decisions possible - the one of deciding the future of Upper Volta. Would it be a military dictatorship like Mali? Would it be an Islamic state like Guinea? No - Nazi dreamed of more, he dreamed of a beacon of democracy and freedom in Africa unlike any other. And so, with permission from the chaotic Parliament he had built in a couple weeks, proclaimed the dissolution of the ruling Military Junta, to the reluctance of the local military clique. Soon enough, a provisional government was set up, promising elections in 4 years. Those years are passing, and with time only Nazi will know if his democratic experiment will breathe new life into Africa."
 POLITICS_BLAISE_BASSOLETH_DESC:0 "The youngest politician in Upper Volta is, unsurprisingly, the one with the biggest dreams. Barely the minimum age to run for office, which is already the lowest of any country in Africa, Blaise has made extensive efforts in solidifying his legitimacy as a real politician in the nascent democracy of Upper Volta. Campaigning among the local unions (boatmen, factory workers, miners, and more!) and gathering them in a single united front with the CGT remnants in Ouagadougou, Blaise decided that the best way to solidify his position as a real force in Upper Voltan politics was to create a political party as a front for his unionist activities, the Parti du Regroupement Africain. Despite his gentle demeanor, Blaise is an ardent speaker and a major advocate for the toiling masses of Upper Volta, most of whom can't even read. Considering all this, the fact that he won the first election in Upper Voltan history might not be surprising, but sometimes dreams really do come true, even for a whole country."
 POLITICS_DIONGOLO_TRAORE_DESC:0 "If anything can be said of Diongolo Traoré, it's that he is a dedicated man. Diongolo has lived all his life as an intellectual in the deepest corners of Ouagadougou, going all across West Africa as his veterinary work became increasingly valued and well-known. With his skills in travel, Diongolo has spent the last few years working to establish an image of a man that knows what he is doing, that has a kind heart, and yet knows what needs to be done to protect Upper Volta from tyrants. A close associate of Nazi Boni, Diongolo's friendly rivalry with Nazi has been an important part of the theatrical web of politics, his intellectual airs and ability to stir an audience to believe he knows what he is talking about has been key to his success at reaching Upper Volta's presidency."
 POLITICS_JOSEPH_CONOMBO_DESC:0 "Child of farmers, Joseph Issoufou Conombo has been close to the earth of Upper Volta, knowing the people of his village in central Upper Volta by name - always a great defender of the local needs of the farmers, Joseph has done intense efforts at centering his political beliefs around that: Tradition, Ruralism and Conservatism. A man of charismatic demeanor, his consistent political programme and appeals to the mostly conservative masses secured his position in Upper Volta's presidency, now assuring that his political programme will be as he promised. Of course, Joseph knows that politics aren't only based on social issues - a graduate in Medicine, Joseph knows the needs of the population economically, and isn't afraid to speak out for their wellbeing."
 POLITICS_DANIEL_OUEZZIN_COULIBALY_DESC:0 "Born to the High Priestess of the Bobo tribe, Daniel always knew what it was like to be wealthy. Later baptised as Daniel, he very quickly worked around the intricacies and web of complexities surrounding the Upper Voltan Christian aristocracy, and subsequently developed a worldview on his experiences there. Absolutely appreciative of a good, wealthy life, Daniel wishes for as many as possible in his home country to enjoy what he has - immense wealth and privilege, luxuries imagined impossible by most in West Africa, and freedoms beyond the imagination of any peasant. Seeking to bring his visionary perspective on society to the political scene, he quickly began distributing money on the streets and got to work bribing political officials and others to further his cause, subsequently creating a web of influence around him, with many lower politicians surrounding his wealth, begging for even a moment of his time. Despite this immense importance, Daniel isn't the most popular, as many peasants see him as an elitist and charlatan who bought his way to prominence. These people are now wrong and irrelevant - Daniel sits in the Presidential Palace with a huge grin on his face, counting his bills as he sips a cold champagne. Now President of the Republic, Daniel will bring about his utopian vision of a liberal, market-oriented Upper Volta, climbing above the status of an agrarian petty state filled with peasants to a truly visionary democracy."
 POLITICS_DIEUDONNE_YOUGBARE_DESC:0 "The man has God in his name, what more is there to tell? Born to Christian parents in Koupéla, Dieudonné had already become interested in Catholicism from the age of five, entering a clerical school in his central Upper Voltan town. Profoundly moved by Christ's message and shocked at the lack of tolerance from his Muslim countrymen to the Christian truth, Dieudonné quickly got to work campaigning for the rights of Christians in Upper Volta. Becoming an arch-bishop, Dieudonné believes it was a sign from God that the blessed land of Upper Volta was freed from the potential of an Acceleratonist takeover, and begrudgingly accepted Upper Volta's independence as necessary. Subsequently, he began political campaigning because, in his words, he \"needed to\". Incredibly hostile to most politicians, Dieudonné convinced almost every Christian in the country that he was their most fierce defender, even if they disagreed with his politics. Despite the immense unlikelihood he'd win considering that Upper Volta's population is only 25% Christian, due to severe lack of ability for the Government to reach northern villages and other problems, Dieudonné scored a slim victory as President of the Republic. Believing this to be Christ's message to him to save Upper Volta from Mohammedan tyranny, Dieudonné has begun fierce work in christianizing Upper Volta, regardless of the whining of the Union de Mohammed and other terrorists."
 POLITICS_SANGOULE_LAMIZANA_DESC:0 "Aboubakar Sangoulé Lamizana's background is a mystery. Born in a small, irrelevant village in Upper Volta, he began military studies after he reached the age of 18, becoming a private within Upper Volta's colonial army. Sangoulé, hearing of the news that the French were barely holding onto his homeland, quickly got to work, talking to Nazi Boni and other local politicians, using his military experience to completely drive out the French, and subsequently becoming the unsung hero of Upper Volta. Hidden from the spotlight by Nazi Boni as a secondary leader of the independence war, Sangoulé began to notice his potential power diminishing further and further. Knowing some political strategy, he started to talk with local conservatives and liberals, seeing who would be the most helpful for his plans. Becoming increasingly influential as the only major general of Upper Volta, he realized that part of his political programme would have to include conservatism and appeal to local muslim populations as the only practicing and self-declared Muslim in the Upper Voltan upper political echelons. Sangoulé, knowing that his ally, Ouezzin, would try to wrangle his influence away, organized an \"Incident\" in the capital, charging the Ouezzinites with treason. With this, the political climate of Upper Volta has gotten more authoritarian than anyone could have expected, and with this, Sangoulé's politics are merely practical, cold, calculating moves that seek to give him the most power without destroying Nazi Boni's legacy."

Fourth, he would begin efforts to create schools across Upper Volta and help children begin to read. Finally, that as many people as possible will be allowed to vote in the incoming election.

The thing is that, unfortunately, most Muslims are largely radicals, with little civility in their beliefs. Many no-name rebel leaders in our North have been fighting the Government in a desperate battle for what they call the creation of a Sahel Caliphate, most likely funded out of Guinea, one of our enemies in the World Stage.

Nazi Boni waited for Mariam to leave as he raised his glass, smiling as he spoke softly, as usual;\n\n \"To Upper Volta.\"\n\nAll the guests smiled aswell, respectfully nodding and gently hitting eachother's glasses, a few drops of champagne dropping here and there as the atmosphere of the conversation got evermore calm and cheerful. Nazi raised his hand and began a speech; \n\"Whatever comes out of this discussion will be the future of Upper Volta's constitution and very social fabric. I will, of course, respect the views of all my benefactors and friends, but I hope you all understand that our healthy rivalries are needed - disagreements are what puts humanity forward.\"\n Some of the table nodded, others respectfully listened. And so, like that, the discussion began - Sangoulé immediately got to work talking about the needs of defending the Nation, with many agreeing - Sangoulé continued, stating that only through a mixed system of democracy and stratocracy Upper Volta can be properly defended. Of course, this meant shock and horror to most of the table - and like that, some even accused Sangoulé of treason. Discord began to arise within the table, and in all his calm resolve, Nazi Boni looked at his comrades with disappointment. \n\"Do you have no shame? He loves Democracy just as we all do. We just have different views. Let us all be civil.\"\n Most of the table settled down, and the discussions continued. Nazi Boni began talking again..."

 upv.7.desc: "The morning sun cast its light upon the city of Ouagadougou, bustling with the customers of morning markets that filled the streets every few days. Such life; yet only miles from this sat a quiet and seemingly largely empty old colonial manor house. The light cast itself at an odd angle onto a long table - nearly ten meters long as a matter of fact, within a large dining hall. All seemed surprisingly quiet - and that was just how Mariam liked it. No one to criticise her every movement, no one to tell her where and how to step. It's just her and her work - no one to complain at anything but the results.\n\nMariam made her way around the table, adjusting the decorative drapes for perfect symmetry all the while humming a catchy local tune she heard as she walked to work just before the sun rose. The notes cascaded lightly off the walls as she continued her tasks - dusting down tables, bookshelves, decorative wall-pieces, along with sweeping up the floor. It was almost a calming monotony that she'd followed for nearly two years. Yet even in this inner calm, something external and unseen disturbed that equilibrium.\n\nThe sun had risen enough so that the light did not blind Mariam at her attempts to look outside the window - it's nice to have a piece of gossip to go back to friends with, right? And so, as she looked outside, giving the usual five second panning stare, the gates of the manner abruptly opened, giving way for multiple presidential vehicles to pull into the roundabout entranceway. Some of the faces she saw in them made her eyes widen. Were they hosting the entire political elite today?!\n\nRushing back to the dining hall in as dignified a manner as possible, she came across her supervisor, smirking at an oft not seen mildly dishevelled manner. Giving him a most adult-like death-stare, he raised an eyebrow and turned back around, saying one sentence to Miriam and those few other employees now present in the room."

The capitalists, social democrats and socialists claw at each other's' throats day after day, yet all this delay on deciding a path of economics leaves our nation at risk of complacency and stagnation should it continue any further. We must decide now.The capitalists, riding off the back of enough lobbyist money to make some American senators jealous, decry the notions that the government must begin making regulations to the nations' markets. They point towards the failures of other African nations and blame their economic and social woes upon the control of the market and of the labour force. \"The money that unregulated business provides for the nation more than makes up for any off the paltry downsides!\" they cry - and perhaps, to a certain extent, they are right. Perhaps capitalism is the common sense human nature they label it as. Who knows?The socialists lambast the capitalists for their sheer dehumanisation of the average Upper Voltan worker and exploitation of their labour, citing the social upheaval and social woes of other nations as the result of capitalist exploitation leaving the working class with no food and no option but violence and crime - with the only way to stop this being regulation of the economy and careful managing of resources to benefit all in society. Capitalists may scoff at this, labelling it as 'utopian' as they always do - but perhaps the socialists are right. Perhaps absolute control of the means of production is the only way to ensure the conditions of all citizens within the nation are humanitarian?There are many between these two camps who decry both sides of the economic debate for their lack of practicality or dismissal of the value of the individual and their conditions. These social democrats cry for social programs and reforms within the democracy, but not a complete dismantling of the market system and upheaval of many people's way of life.An ultimatum has been made, a conclusion has been reached.

Three men rose from the crowd, one representative from each side of the debate, speaking in turn to the men of the room - hoping that those who are unsure will be swayed.\"The Upper Voltan nation was, for near three decades, a French protectorate. Despite many who decry them for taking our independence and their actions against the natives in the area, they lifted us from the Iron Age civilisation we once were into a partially industrialised twentieth century state. They fell to the bizarre futurist ideology under their leader Artaud - and yet, they remain France, the nation that spared us the woes of much of the native population of Africa and giving us much in return. Some call the woes they did give us unforgivable, but can we look past that and see the old friend in them? Yes, we can!\" And with the crescendo of the speech and a large amount of cheers, the first man, a UDIHV rep, sat down.\"The British are the last beacon of Old Europe's superpowers where all others have fallen into disarray or collapse. They sit across the channel, staring death in the face - that being Artaud's France, of course - and smile. Normalcy and stability is what many in government, business and citizenry alike all wish for in their nations, and we are no different. If we cannot risk catching madness from being protected by the remnant of what once was our colonial overlords, perhaps someone similar in the power of London would suffice?\" Giving the room something to think about and smiling at the looks of consideration, the liberal sat down, his job done.\"Many look at these powers, look at the considerations in our government to cry out for their protection and scoff. \"It makes us look weak!\" they cry, lambasting others on their potential impact on trade and foreign policy. Perhaps they are correct - did we break free into our own nation only years ago just to be slaved to a superpower once again?\" The social democrat looked upon the room, his eyes conveying the rhetorical nature of the question. \"My friends… freedom or slavery?\""

Nazi Boni was their hope, and against all odds, he succeeded. Upper Volta was freed, ruled by the people.But, are the French truly gone? Their influence still lingers on. The French are still in Europe, the French are still in Africa. There is a force wispering in the soul of Upper Volta, yelling how much better things were under the white hand. How democracy will soon crack and things would be much worse than they were. No matter who they vote, everything will soon return to the command of the Europeans, or worse, no command at all.The whispers are heard by the people, they know how fickle the flames of democracy are, how much weaker they are when compared to the might of France. And yet, they care not. What matters is the now, what matters is the present and how they are blessed to have a free and fair country to live on."
