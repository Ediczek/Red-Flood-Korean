Among his insurgents the orphans of the first Wushe incident, boys whose fathers, brothers, uncles and cousins were beheaded at the hands of Japanese collaborating natives. Now eager to return the favour, these savage warriors are threatening not only the their local clan rivals and the Japanese settlers, but the Chinese as well. 모나의 군대는 막강한 유격군으로서 원하는 어느때든 나타나 공격했다가 수풀 속으로 사라져 버리곤 합니다. 이들은 자치와 조상들의 땅에서 중국인들을 몰아내겠다는 열망으로 단결했습니다. 모나를 어떻게 처리하느냐가 불안한 임시정부의 가장 큰 과제가 된 가운데, 일부에선 원주민들에 대한 한화를 실시해 계획된 일본 문화 말살과 유사한 선상에서 끝을 보자고 제안했습니다. 또 다른 쪽에선 원주민의 자치를 인정하고 법으로 이를 보호하여 저들의 고유 정체성이, 타이완 섬의 서부를 지배하는 Min-Hokkien and Hakka-Chinese identities와는 분리된 타이완 민족 감정의 새 focal point가 되도록 하자고 제시했습니다"

The crisis deepens by the day as parties begin to organise 'People's Militias' to defend their properties and beat up political opponents.

The band marched through Taipei into the morning, attracting a police presence, some officers simply joined the march while others looked on. By the time the march reached the Government district they had swelled into a mob, they were now joined by factory workers and civilians waiving flags and shouting slogans. When the march approached the National Assembly they found it guarded by soldiers and police, for an hour a stand-off ensued, then the first rock was thrown. Then the first fires were lit. Finally the first shot was fired. From then it was a battle, soldiers and police engaged in shoot-outs while the mob rushed into the building. When the dust had settled the people had won, those among them shot dead were now martyrs of the Revolution, including some party leaders. More importantly Taiwan now has leadership."

Despite the name this group of radicals has its own organised street gang, visible by their flamboyant yellow uniforms and blue arm-bands. They have quickly set about plastering the streets of all major urban areas with fliers. The posters are adorned with pastel colours and speak of the cultural soul of Taiwan being in a state of decay, only the PPP can save it. Attached is a treatise, a brief manifesto from the painter 첸청보. The Pen and Pencil Treatise has spread throughout the island and taken the interest of many, plans to make Taiwan truly it's own, not a slave to Japan or China nor even to Asia. The Treatise claims Taiwan is and can make itself the centre of the world, through cultural revival and social cooperation the island can become great as never before! All it will take is the will and vision to do so. The party has been denounced as French boot-lickers and sell-outs to western imperialists by their opponents, but there is no denying their growing popularity."

He declared his true intentions for Taiwan, even as he spoke the Yellow-Jackets stormed the Government buildings. They were armed with painted rifles and pistols with intricate carvings, they quickly swept away any resistance at gun-point and promptly tore down the symbols of old colonial rule and burnt them. 첸청보의 대형 초상화가 was hung in the main parliament chamber, government officials who refused to swear loyalty to the new leader in sight of the painting were shot.

They lionised the bravery of native leader Mona Rudao, they called on their fellow citizens to begin a frenzy of popular expression. The Yellow-Jackets kept relative order as the crowds were whipped into a mob of discontent, then together the Club leaders and the people marched into Government unopposed. The Club announced that the Assembly Hall would become a new exhibition of the works of the people, most forms of expression were permitted to be displayed. Notable exceptions included traditional Chinese or Japanese works. Taiwanese Aboriginal works were subject to ideological scrutiny, those that did not please the Club's sensibilities were burnt. The seat of Government now resides at the Club's headquarters in Chiayi, its first act - replacing the Taiwanese Police with it's own Yellow-Jackets. A spate of brutal reprisals against Communist activists has resulted in the Police Stations being nick-named 'Hornets Nests' by some locals."

It is high time to rid ourselves of such subversive elements. Thus a grand operation to root out the leftists and make examples of their leaders has been put into action, thousands of Yellow-Jackets and Chi-Hsing Volunteer Soldiers have been organised into a 'Counter-Cultural Defence Division' with explicit orders to shoot known Communists and Socialist Leaders on sight, with arrest warrants on anyone found in locations known to be used for leftist gatherings.

The party doesn't see it that way however, and now that the PPP's power has been consolidated, there is little need for such elitist ideas as these any longer. Beginning with impromptu party conferences across Taiwan, the technocratic ranks were quickly singled out and ejected from party grounds - directly into the arms of waiting Yellow-Jackets outside. Some of Taiwan's best and brightest have now been placed under house arrest and had their political powers stripped. A select few ring-leaders have disappeared entirely following the conferences, lending to rumours that many among the 'Clique of Elitist Traitors' have been murdered by the state. Adding to suspicions is the emergence of a new piece in the Chiayi Hall of Arts, a grand canvas adorned in Taiwanese characters written in a suspiciously blood-scented oil, the characters read 'The Future Belongs To Men Of Culture'."
