 POLITICS_CUONG_DE_DESC:0 "A Pan-Asianist and a Republican Revolutionary in his youth, when he still fought for the 인도차이나 people's right of self determination back in 1900s-1910s, he accepted the Japanese proposal regarding setting up a new, \"free\" regime in war-torn Annam after being \"liberated\" and was later officially granted his current position by the Japanese after the Great War. He was a suitable candidate, for one, he was a popular revolutionary prince, who also was a loyalist to the Pan-Asian vision of Emperor Taisho. Cuong De spent 10 years in Japan, studying the benefits of the Meiji Revolution to apply them to his homeland. However, the year is now 1936, and after 18 years of reign, although the now \"emperor\" Nam-Hùng (translated to \"The Great South\") proposed countless reforms and policies that would have benefited the people and perhaps even save the weak and barely functioning regime, the country is still de facto ran by the Japanese businessmen with their military and old French plantation owners. But his voice was unheard, as he holds no real power. And as the days are passing by, the people are starving and the brutal exploitation of the locals has ruined every good images of the Japanese, the majority of the people are slowly being influenced by revolutionaries and their radical ideas, which leads to them forming small groups and clubs in secret, with the sole mission of to get rid of Cuong-De and his Japanese \"friends\" once and for all. Cuong-De, however, is already aware of the ELF's existence and activities and supports them, even going as far as to leak documents and other information about the horrible crimes committed by the Japanese in order to finally regain the well deserved freedom for his homeland and to redeem his name."
 POLITICS_NGO_DINH_DIEM_DESC:0 "Diem Ngo Dinh Diem was born on January 3rd, 1901, to Catholic Pro-French Mandarins. As their father Ngo Dinh Kha was known as a collaborator with the French civilizing mission to modernize the Nation, the family's name became associated with the French's brutal exploitation in Annam. Ngo Dinh Kha and some other family members were later purged in 1920 for refusing to collaborate with the newly arrived Japanese and his son Ngo Dinh Khoi, who admired the Pan-Asianist messages and propaganda of the Japanese, defected to attempt to redeem his family's name in the new Colonial Regime. But the other surviving members like Diem, Nhu and Thuc were forced to scatter all over Vietnam. These three later became manual workers in Saigon. Diem slowly rose and became a foreman of a factory while witnessing the worker's horrible working conditions and later learned and embraced Socialist teachings that were spreading in the factory at the time. He also became influenced by Nhu and the political theories of Personalism and decided to found his own reinterpretation of Mourner's Personalism with Confucian, Marxism and Traditional ideas but his idiosyncratic \"Socialism\" has made him a controversial figure and led to him being attacked by Radical Orthodox Marxists that have accused him of revisionism and his ideas as a confusing mess with conflicting ideas. But according to Diem, the main pillar of Diem's Socialism is: \"Personalism, The Community and the Spiritual aspects of Society\" and \"our society was collaborating and all of the people were working toward perfection with the aid of God, before materialistic exploitation greed has long corrupted the minds of the people with capitalism and violence, extremist ideas rising with their selfish agendas that seek to destroy and enslave all \". Later he and his brother, Nhu, joined the ELF at the invitation of a Catholic Priest in Saigon around 1928-1929. Diem later gained the respect of the \"father of the revolution\" Mai Lao Bang and become respected by his revolutionary peers. He was known to rant about the evils of class divisions, western taboos, and the flawed nature of capitalism and another extremist forms of ideas that only encourage perpetual conflicts and sins. Diem was controversial due to his questionable methods of trying to unify the other cliques and factions inside the ELF, with both Leftists and Rightists elements calling him a utopian dreamer of unrealistic and confusing ideas, but he has since become famous and with his Nationalist and Moderate Socialist allies, he was elected as the General Secretary of the ELF around 1934 after Mai Lao Bang's health had declined. With Diem's latest speeches and policies promoting a final unification of all ideas and all forms of classes out there for utopia and to get rid of the Japanese and their forces."
 NGUYEN_DESC:0 "Born April 8, 1912, Nguyen Loc is a former martial arts trainer turned military officer, an ambitious young man, and above all, a symbol to his people. Bringing valuable combat experience to the army, soldiers commanded by him are experts in close quarters combat as well as traditional and guerrilla warfare. His opponents fear his martial prowess and raw strength."
 DOI_DESC:0 "Born in 1903, Sergeant Doi Cung is a natural choice to fight Japanese rule in 인도차이나, as his experience leading patriots against French colonialists makes him a competent and loyal officer. Cung has risen fast in the ranks of our improvised army, and he has already shown great promise in leading our forces to victory."
 HO_DESC:0 "Born in 1884, Ho Hac Lam may be a revolutionary fighting for Annam, but he is by no means an Annamite. Rather, he is an established officer of the Guomindang who sympathizes heavily with our movement. As he encourages more Chinese nationalists to extend the fight to Annam, Lam has chosen to plant himself here and serve our revolution to the fullest. His experience with both urban and rural insurrection makes him an invaluable asset."
 NGUYEN_THUC_DESC:0 "Born in 1884, Nguyen Thuc Canh is the definition of a grunt, having served long stints as a soldier. However, his performance has recently come to light under the new administration, causing him to be thrust into a leadership position. Although unfamiliar with tactical minutia, Nguyen Thuc Canh knows how a fight feels, looks, and operates."
 ROS_DESC:0 "Born in 1890, Ros-Neth was a former police officer in Cambodia and a soldier in the Great War having earned numerous medals and awards, and is a decorated and celebrated combat veteran. Although he has been retired for some time, the recent events in Annam have brought him back into the fog of war. An old and experienced officer, Ros-Neth remembers his time fighting in Europe and Asia very well, and plans to bring whatever it takes from that time to crush the enemies of Annam."
 DAI_acolonialstate:0 "Cowardly Leadership"
 DAI_acolonialstate_desc:0 "Puppet \"Emperor\" Cuong De took the throne of 인도차이나 in 1918 at the behest of the Japanese. He has since accepted every policy the Japanese have forced on him. Appeasing the Japanese has come at a price, starvation in the countryside and abuses in the Japanese concessions is rife. Cuong De is now known as nothing more than a coward by his people."
 DAI_united:0 "Rising Discontent"
 DAI_united_desc:0 "The Japanese were initially welcomed as \"Liberators\" from the French when they took over 인도차이나 in 1919. However, in 16 years most policies implemented were only to the benefit of the Japanese - the occupation and Nihonisation of Saigon and Haiphong, ceding half of Cao-Miên and Ai-Lao to our rivals - only fueled the hatred and open rebellious acts against the current regime. Such rebellions have gone on to form Revolutionary and Nationalist parties, with the common goal of Freedom and Self determination for the peoples of 인도차이나."
 DAI_nihonisation:0 "Nihonisation"
 DAI_nihonisation_desc:0 "The enlightened suzerainty of the Japanese has brought a great many changes to Annam, not the least of which is a tide of Japanese investment and modern machinery. Moreover, Japanese immigrants arrive every month, bridging new skills and cultural conflict to both the cities and countryside farms of 인도차이나. While some racist detractors have derided this as a blatant attempt to relive population pressures in Japan, any Japanese diplomat can explain at length that this is a pure expression of Asian brotherhood. A brotherhood so valuable that the contribution of arts produced with new Japanese-sponsored industry for the common defense against Imperialism is a small price to pay."
 DAI_Mandarins_Warlordism:0 "Mandarins Warlordism"
 DAI_Mandarins_Warlordism_desc:0 "The Imperial Government in recent years slowly had devolved into a mess with Pro-Japanese factions igniting purges and political drama against other factions. Further, the Emperor's attempted modernisation policies that mimic the successful Meiji reforms have been ignored by most Mandarins who have, since Liberation of 1918, slowly consolidated more and more power for themselves and ruling their provinces as if they were kings, some even raising their own militias or dealing with the Japanese and other foreign powers without regard for Emperor and the Central Phu Xuan's government. Something must change!"

He is the eldest grandson of King Gia Long, and the direct grandson of Prince Canh. Due to the early death of Prince Canh, his ancestor Hoang Ton Dan was still young at that time, and the throne passed to his successor, Prince Dam, ie King Minh Mang. But after assisting in the liberation of Annam with the aid of his comrades in the VNQPH (The League to Restore Vietnam) and the storming of the Phu Xuan Citadel (9 June of 1918) marking the birth of a free Annam, Cuong De was then crowned as the Emperor. This began the new era of Annamite self determination and freedom with protection from Japan. His reign bringing with it the industrialization and modernization of the country with the model being mimicking the Meiji Restoration with a heavy emphasis on a powerful centralized groverment and a parliamentary system to represent the people and advise the King. So far, it has worked well and will be the foundation for a future powerful Vietnamese empire."
