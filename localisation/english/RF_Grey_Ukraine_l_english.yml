 NUK_brotherhood_desc:0 "Kyiv, to its dissatisfaction, could not find anyone to organize a Western Ukrainian-friendly government there. Most Ukrainians, despite remembering their youth in Kharkiv or the Donbas, have long accepted their fate as servants of the Tsar. The socialists there were too weak to form a stable government.\n\nFaced with desperation and the chance of losing valuable territory to the Kazakhs, the Ukrainians reached for an old dusty ace: Nykyfor Hryhoriv. Initially associated with the Russian Republicans, later with the Ukrainians, and for a time with Nestor Makhno, the Otaman, together with old friends from the remnants of Makhno's Black Army in Ukraine and the Caucasus, eventually reached Tomsk. His newly formed government has placed power in the hands of Ukrainian workers and peasant councils; consequently, many of his former friends took power in these councils. The theoretical representation of Jews in these councils ended in pogroms. The bourgeoisie, which had already settled comfortably in the lands they had colonized, were met with bands of anarchists who were eager to plunder their establishments. As incited by Nykyfor, the Ukrainians did not spare their Russian \"brothers\" their revenge after so many years of slavery.\n\nDespite this chaos in the anarchy, a certain order can be seen here. This alliance of SRs, a few members of the Kazakh branch of OUN, and old anarchists united by nationalist fervor bind the Ukrainian communities there together, and surprisingly, Nykyfor is loyal to a calling at last. He provides active aid to the Ukrainians by supplying them with food and supplies, and by strongly reprimanding any soldier who has harmed a Ukrainian orphan; this mercy, of course, does not apply to Ukraine's enemies."
