#LEADER DESCRITIONS#

DAN_amber_baltic_sea:0 "발트해의 호박석"
DAN_amber_baltic_sea_desc:0 "Amidst the burning fire of the Eurasian Civil War, the city of Danzig slipped through German fingers into the hands of the Polish. Yet the coalish fragments that spilt from the forge of Europe proved too hot to handle alone; therefore, as a sign of friendship between kindred revolutionaries - as well as a way to smooth over a particularly nasty border dispute - in 1929, the joint powers of the Warsaw Pact drew up a plan to smith the glowing embers of the trade port into a glistening gem. Thus, with a handshake and a measuring chain, the Free Hanseatic City of Danzig was born, and alongside it a particularly strange model of government: Hanseatic Socialism.\n\nMoreso a set of exceptions than an actual ideology, Hanseatic Socialism is the attempt at reconciling socialist principles with the running of a trade center plugged into the global flow of capital. Despite the rather unorthodox methods, it appears that the Levite brain child has born fruit—Danzig has flourished beneath the Red Hansa, as foreign traders rub shoulders with worker-ran manufactories. Regardless of the contradictions inherent in its birth, it appears that as long as the money flows and the boat is not rocked, the "Amber of the Baltic Sea" will remain as the crown jewel of the Warsaw Pact."
DAN_marshals_gaze:0 "원수의 응시 아래"
DAN_marshals_gaze_desc:0 "Despite the Polish releasing their grip, their hand remains wrapped around Danzig's neck. While the reservation of a certain amount of seats in the Volkstag to the Polish minority is amenable to most, there exists an all-seeing eye above Danzig, the eye of Józef Piłsudski. A part of his army is permanently stationed as watchmen of the Warsaw Pact's bastard child, and lead by General Gustaw Orlicz-Dreszer, the Polish Garrison in the Free Hanseatic City of Danzig has only made politics more complicated.\n\nA man with visible Sanationist persuasions, Orlicz-Dreszer and his merry men have overseen the boom of a radicalized Polish populace as the rejects of the Bruno Jasieński dominated avant-garde flocked to Danzig in droves, viewing it as a safehaven for their radical thought. On paper, the Polish Garrison is loyal solely to the Warsaw Pact and exists only to protect Danzig from Prussian aggression; yet no man can serve two gods, and if push comes to shove, only Providence can tell where Orlicz-Dreszer's loyalties lie."
DAN_ist_deutsch:0 "단치히는 독일이다!"
DAN_ist_deutsch_desc:0 "When the May terrorists let open the gates for the Polish barbarians, there were still some men who stood true to Kaiser, and although the warm mass of bodies may have pushed Ludendorff into Prussia, the Teutonic Knights have taken up arms to defend the homeland yet again. While still forced to play ball with the Warsaw Pact and wear their red star, the scales of fate have tipped in our favor. The crimson rats who surround us, try as they might, know they cannot attempt a second invasion with the combined might of the Birkeneid backing us. Our brothers across the border may remain separated by false treaties and blood-soaked ink, but as the rope begins to tighten around the necks of the vermin, a single cry rises throughout the city: Danzig was Deutsch, Danzig is Deutsch, and Danzig forever will be Deutsch!"
