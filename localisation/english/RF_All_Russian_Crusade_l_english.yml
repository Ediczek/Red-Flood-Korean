Konstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky was born in Blagoveschensk on the Amur River, to a reasonably middle class family with a notary patriarch. Much of his childhood was spent in a country at war, and a Russian Far East that avoided direct invasion by the Germans did not escape the revolutionary turmoil that followed. The deprivations and mobilizations of his homeland may have had an impact on his eventual ideological evolution. In the final year of the civil war, he was drafted to the Siberian frontline despite being a teenager, and for him the story of the war was not one of heroic rear-guard actions, but of retreat after demoralizing retreat.\n\nIt is unclear what the eventual inciting incident was, given the need to operate clandestinely, but Rodzaevsky was involved in propaganda and arson activities for anti-republican organizations by the mid-20s. The young Konstantin would escape arrest and a certain death sentence through flight into the Russian Empire in 1927. While he was received pleasantly as a defector, it was far from a hero's welcome, and so Konstantin followed his father's footsteps in legal studies before finding the knowledge to make sense of his youth. Mother Russia had long been poisoned from within by the internal enemy, and while the liberal, Jew, and communist had been burned out of the core of the country, the cancer still metastasized in the Far East.\n\nAlmost scrawny in appearance, but thrumming with an obvious energy, Rodzaevsky was able to convince local governors near the border to support his project of creating a Black Hundreds organization to carry out activities against Harbin. Investments made in part to satisfy the impulsive radical soon paid dividends - his oratory and drive, especially in smuggling and broadcasting propaganda into the Republic, saw his star rise. Now, with the bastards to the south fighting amongst themselves, a private organization such as his Crusade is perfectly suited to operate independently in the region while the Empire sorts out its own domestic matters. So begins the long-awaited campaign of vengeance - God with us!"

Sergei Bulgakov, Nikolay Berdyaev, Dmitry Merezhkovsky and others have degenerated our faith – not to mention the perversions of yesteryear like Rasputin and the Old Believers! They introduced the voice of Mammon, godless socialism, and sexual perversion into our holy faith. To them and to all others we declare WAR!

People who jump out of windows because they think they can fly! Oh, what horror this is! Looking even from a distance at these anarchists and urbanites sends shivers down your spine, and listening to their sermons only makes the blood boil in your veins. The Creatorium is an excellent example of how all modernity can destroy us, and so we must destroy them before that happens.

They have turned all sanctities into a mere product consumed by mindless masses, who are not even aware that they are being exploited by a secret cabal of communists and capitalists.

What it meant, in the estimation of the nascent general staff, was that the Crusade was no longer operating at the end of a lengthy Imperial supply line – it meant they were operating without one.\n\nThis had not escaped the notice of Konstantin Rodzaevsky. Sheer doggedness had funded and equipped this organization in the first place, but the new absence of well-wishers back home sending surplus shoes and bullets accelerated the questions in the mind of the Crusade's leadership. Triumph would not come through simply chanting Orthodox hymns and walking into Harbin over humbled republicans; the Hundreds needed infrastructure, administration, military production – in a word, government.\n\nBut how to run it? That was the puzzle for the former law student, staring past the campaign maps on the table. On one hand, the traditional ways of the Black Hundreds had an appeal that was easy to explain to a peasant recruit: find the enemies of Holy Russia who put you in this state and break them. Orthodoxy, autocracy, nationality. On the other, perhaps the old foe across the strait had something to teach Russia about leaping into the future while maintaining tradition. Of course, it would fall to the Vozhd to break the deadlock in his staff."
