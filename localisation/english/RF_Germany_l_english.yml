 POLITICS_Reventlow_DESC:0 "Two decades ago, as with many Germans, Ernst Reventlow's life was set on a radically different path. Born in a disparaged \"grey town by the sea\" to Danish nobility, Ernst Christian Einar Ludvig Detlev was an aristocrat who served with some distinction in the Imperial Navy. A forced resignation due to, of all things, taking a French wife seemed a sign of how his strong will could get him into trouble. This would only continue in the Great War, where he turned his freelancer's pen to decrying the wartime government as insufficiently committed to victory – eventually leading to a slander lawsuit that was not resolved by the time of the German Revolution.\n\nThe noble shorn of his title would find himself an uneasy fellow traveller with the new socialist republic. Though he had been sympathetic to the revolting soldiers in North Germany, the prospect of a patriotic socialism that would appeal to him seemed laughable until the Deutsche Sozialrepublikanische Partei's formation in 1923. Through association with the GSRN that had formed from the soldiers' councils, Reventlow was slowly convinced to discard the last vestiges of his nobility and join the DSRP, now a committed convert to the cause. By the 1930s, with the first generation of the party's leadership starting to move on, he was suddenly a grey eminence, introducing his appreciation for the classics and old Germania into the organization's discourse with his \"Widukindisch\" faction. And now, after a strategic alliance with other communists who understood the appeal of nationalism, not to mention his connections with the GSRN-turned-SRNP, the world can speak of Premier Reventlow.\n\nNaturally, a former aristocrat taking the reins of socialism's heartland was enough cause to raise an eyebrow before even considering what a titanic cultural shift he represents. Gone is the staid professionalism of the SPD, and its urban focus has partially shifted with the rise of a party that extols the rural peasantry. Reventlow's hands have forged a connection between the maximal revolutionaries of the SRNP and KPD and the more culturally conservative socialists of the German nation – even some of the CSABP, despite his professed commitment to increased state laïcité. It remains to be seen what his personal politics and his coalition will produce, but the new Premier can promise his supporters one thing — The future belongs to Germany."
 POLITICS_Radek_DESC:0 "Is there a man in Germany who has profited more from association with the exiled Russian Vladimir Lenin? Karl Radek, born Karol Sobelsohn in the hinterland of Austria-Hungary, has been on the outside of many \"mainline\" socialist movements since he arrived in Germany in 1907, fleeing a Russian prison sentence. While he had been a member of Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania alongside future Premier Luxemburg, his political career as an exile got off to a much rockier start. Factional politics within the SPD, along with his strident criticism of Karl Kautsky and alignment with Lenin, cost Radek too many allies at a time when he was being smeared by his old Polish allies. It was probably only the outbreak of the Great War in 1913 and the flight of socialists like him into Switzerland that spared him ejection from the party.\n\nSwiss exile solidified Radek's connections with other foreign communists, a grouping he was frequently on the far left of. However, when the fires of the Great War were replaced with the fires of revolution, Radek was already in Bremen coordinating militias and expropriations. With the SPD ultimately victorious, he would soon fall in with Lenin again after his frequent debate partner returned victorious from Hungary. While the so-called \"Leninist\" grouping of radicals would be satisfied with a number of governmental positions – Lenin's time as Foreign Secretary, for better or worse, had gallons of ink spilled over it – it was only a matter of time before the final rupture of the Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands with the SPD, established in 1929 by all manner of party radicals.\n\nA long and winding road of opposition ended with Karl Radek coming to power in Germany. Fellow socialists being butchered in the streets of Austria, in Radek's view, only further highlighted the price of a \"compromised\" socialist leadership in Germany, but how would the hegemonic SPD be displaced? Lenin's pragmatism on recognizing the national question, combined with a reassessment of why men like Heinrich Laufenberg had broken from the SPD to form the DSRP, brought Radek to his final conclusions — nationalism could be channeled towards left-wing ends, could it not? A strategic alliance with the DSRP has placed Premier Radek at the head of a coalition of revolutionary agrarians, hardline Leninists, and the oft-neglected council-communist wing of the KPD. All of them are united in the cause of an intensified revolution. 1919 was only the beginning. Let the reactionaries within and without tremble!"
 POLITICS_Goebbels_DESC:0 "Tracing the road taken by Premier Joseph Goebbels, the helmsman of the revolution, one would perhaps be shocked to find a sickly young boy who once entertained becoming a priest. Spared from the draft during the Great War by a persistent foot deformation, the anti-Catholic trend of the Ludendorff dictatorship would drive him to take up arms with the SPD in 1918. Though he would eventually complete his PhD despite delays caused by the fighting in the German Revolution and the shakeup of academia that followed, the sorrows of young Joseph were many in the early 1920s. What did his studies of romantic literature mean in a Germany trying to break from its past? What did dreams of becoming a popular writer mean when he could only be published as a small-time journalist? His personal and professional isolation led to him reading voraciously while searching for purpose, and with the initial revolutionary fury of the new republic, this mostly led him to the work of Germany's socialist luminaries.\n\nIt was soon after the 1923 formation of the DSRP that Goebbels, finding something familiar and compelling in the rhetoric he heard, applied for membership and work in the new party. The party of outsiders saw the merits in promoting a man who rose to fight in the revolution despite his condition - Finding his place as a propagandist and writer for party papers, he would develop a carefully-practised style of public speaking that made him invaluable to recruitment efforts. However, his evocation of the German past he'd studied to find revolutionary rhetoric and imagery would form a dialectic with his budding socialist consciousness, and the errant romantic found his mind circling the imagery of 1848 and the revolutionaries who gave their lives for the dream of a liberated Germany. The synthesis was an articulated doctrine of social republicanism that would be embraced by his followers within the party, the \"Heckerisch\" wing.\n\nFinally leveraging his talents to upend the DSRP's political hierarchy, an alliance with other dissident communists has delivered Premier Goebbels to power. Some, the timid and traditional-minded, suspect him a reactionary. Nothing could be further from the truth. Rather, the new programme of government brings the traditions – German traditions – of revolt and revolution together with socialism to create a government suited to this German context. Premier Goebbels has promised a socialism to realize the promise of 1848, of both the Communist Manifesto and the heirs of Hegel and the Enlightenment. All he asks of the people is that they are prepared for the terrible, total struggle it will require."
 POLITICS_Brecht_DESC:0 "The first generation of German revolutionaries exits the stage, and a new one takes its place – but does the same director not hold the script? Eugen Berthold Friedrich Brecht was born into a mixed Catholic and Lutheran family in Augsburg, living a reasonably comfortable middle class life until the Revolution. Even so, once the initial war fever wore off, the teenage Brecht would court trouble until his expulsion from school for, among other things, an essay mocking the sentiment of dying for one's country – a dangerous move under the Ludendorff dictatorship. Luckily, after a time as a teenage socialist militant, the rechristened \"Bert Brecht\" would return to school to complete his studies.\n\nAfter the revolution, however, Brecht got to work producing plays and poetry that made a splash on the German literary scene. The frantic, nervous energy of the man, possibly stemming from side effects of childhood rheumatic fever, was channeled into his feverish work. Taking in a complex stew of influences from the American comic actor Charlie Chaplin to the writings of Marx, his eye for social commentary and theories of a new \"epic\" style of theatre came close to utterly defining this sector of German art through the 20s and early 30s.\n\nFate would have other plans in mind, however, as the SPD chairman Karl Kautsky would exert his titanic influence on the party to de facto name Brecht as the successor to Paul Levi. In an SPD trying to assert its purpose after the doldrums of the previous administration, what then is the use of Premier Brecht? On one hand, a break from Levi's \"normalization\" to reignite the revolutionary fire once more. On the other, the creation of an official socialist cultural programme to stand against the accelerationists claiming the mantle of the artistic avant-garde. And so, the playwright takes the political stage."
 POLITICS_Seghers_DESC:0 "Born Anna Reiling in the city of Mainz, the young \"Netty\" probably never would have expected to come this far. Her entire life up to adulthood was spent in the German Empire, and her life since has been under socialism. As if to add to some dramatic metanarrative about the state itself, her husband since the 1920s is even a Hungarian communist. Coincidences aside, nobody can deny the young writer and poet is a committed socialist, having even formally left her faith behind while working as an SPD operative.\n\nBut who is Anna Seghers, who has come to inhabit an old alias she used as an author and revolutionary? Her work has demonstrated an eye for the plight of those who suffer under dictatorships across the border, or give up their lives for an uncertain future away from tyranny. It has also cast a critical eye towards the radicals of the German opposition, as in her recent novel \"The Fellows,\" which warned of the consequences should the more nationalistically-minded parties take power and replicate the authoritarianism of the Wilhelmine Empire, or the Prussians and Austrians. Even so, Seghers has been willing to extoll the virtues of German poetry as a whole – a citing it as a tradition of liberty worth being proud of.\n\nFate would have other plans in mind for the poet, however, as the SPD chairman Karl Kautsky would exert his titanic influence on the party to de facto name Seghers as the successor to Paul Levi. In an SPD trying to assert its purpose after the doldrums of the previous administration, what then is the use of Premier Seghers? On one hand, a break from Levi's \"normalization\" to reignite the revolutionary fire once more. On the other, a blend of humanism and socialism intent on meeting tyranny on the field of battle. And so, the poet takes the political stage."
 POLITICS_Frahm_DESC:0 "Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm was born into a country under siege, in the first winter of the Great War. For him, the first great political questions of the German Revolution were settled before he was even a teenager. If he was concerned with anything at the time, it was with growing up in Lubeck under a working mother thankfully assisted by her extended family. His growing political consciousness under the SPD nevertheless led him to join the party's youth wing, where he found a support structure he had been lacking and developed a true sense of community with his colleagues.\n\nHowever, the young Frahm gained increasing credibility in the socialist youth organizations as time went on. His charisma and looks led to him occasionally being tapped to go on diplomatic missions to foreign socialist parties, including in the Spanish Republic and United Kingdom. Some wondered about the true nature of these missions as time went on – perhaps it was merely an amusing coincidence that Frahm spoke fluent Norwegian on his visit to the northern country, so soon before the revolt against the government began, but who could say for certain? What is known is that he has done his utmost in the intervening years to maintain the SPD's appeal to young Germans, even as they increasingly resemble the political establishment itself.\n\nFate would have other plans in mind, however, as the SPD chairman Karl Kautsky would exert his titanic influence on the party to de facto name Frahm as the successor to Paul Levi. In an SPD trying to assert its purpose after the doldrums of the previous administration, what then is the use of Premier Frahm? On one hand, a break from Levi's \"normalization\" to reignite the revolutionary fire once more. On the other, a surprisingly canny political operator who represents the freshest face that Germany can put forth on the domestic and international stages. And so, the former youth leader takes the political stage."
 POLITICS_Meyer_DESC:0 "Everything old is new again, it seems, as Ernst Meyer takes the reins of the republic. Like a number of his old colleagues, Meyer hails from Eastern Europe, though he was born in and pursued his PhD in Prussia rather than having Polish origins. Joining the SPD in 1908, he would become a major writer for the party newspaper \"Vorwärts\" even before his graduation. Like the other future revolutionary leadership, he ended up on the far left of the party, and he would also avoid persecution during the Great War by going into hiding – though he would surreptitiously travel between Germany and Switzerland as international socialist conferences and party activities demanded.\n\nThe outbreak of the German Revolution saw Meyer intensify his propaganda activities as a writer. Once the struggle was won, he would alternate between propaganda and doing major work in the economics ministry under Rosa Luxemburg's government. The ascent of Paul Levi and the \"Realists\" in 1928 would place Ernst firmly on the outside of the government's orthodoxy for a time, however, and he found himself focusing more on theory and journalism as his administrative portfolio rapidly declined. One of his major causes at the time was that the SPD would have to form alliances with suitable members of the opposition parties – creating a so-called united front - if it wanted to properly strengthen socialism. Alas, when Levi's star faded, Meyer assumed that it was time for the old guard of the revolution to step aside and cede power the new generation they had nurtured.\n\nFate would have other plans in mind, however, as the SPD chairman Karl Kautsky would exert his titanic influence on the party to de facto name Meyer as the successor to Paul Levi. In an SPD trying to assert its purpose after the doldrums of the previous administration, what then is the use of Premier Meyer? In general, a break from Levi's \"normalization\" to reignite the revolutionary fire once more, recapturing the fervor of 1918 within the party. And so, another of Red Rosa's colleagues takes the political stage once more..."

 GER_democracy_of_proletariat_desc:0 "Like many things in our Republic, the roots of our political system date way back to the revolution. When the workers revolted under the flag of Social Democracy in the West, the frontlines on the East saw their own rebellion - soldiers refusing to be cannon fodder for Ludendorff rose up under the leadership of such men as Otto Braun, Ernst Jünger, Karl Paetel or Ernst Röhm. All of them brave and noble comrades, they sympathised with the proletarian cause - just with one crucial difference, that almost led to a three-way civil war. Unlike the internationalists of the SPD, the soldiers saw the new Germany as a great, modern, national republic. \n\nThe situation was growing tense - and a compromise had to be made quickly. The nationalists couldn't accept the voices of some communists calling for a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", which demanded an one-party state ruled by the SPD. Instead - the workers' and soldiers' councils came in help. From that point, Germany was made a democratic council republic, with a central legislature elected by the members of local councils, where all parties that swore commitment to socialism could run. The first parties registered were the SPD and Paetel's Groups of Social Revolutionary Nationalists, which later reformed into the accelerationist SRNP. Soon, conservative nationalists, moderate revisionists, christian socialists and the Leninist ultra-left all formed their own factions - giving rise to a chaotic Republic of Councils and Parties."

We, the SPD, will take Germany to victory!\"\n\nPaul Levi's normalization campaign has so far been a mild success. The transition from imperial to radical uprooted Germany as whole, and in the years settling down, the rebuilding effort was decentralized among the councils. This localized issue would be the primary target under Levi, with mixed results. Moderating the council system has received harsh pushback, and the attempt at quelling revolutionary isolation in favor of building a friendly-faced socialism hand-in-hand with some moderates members of the Internationale has left a sour taste in the mouths of some. Despite this, we push on, attempting to build our revolution, our socialism, and our Germany, one step at a time."

The masses there cling to the voice of the Catholic church, the solid foundation of the Bavarian social order, listening more to the priests than to social-democratic agitators.\n\nFrom this land, many conservative parties get their support - the CSABPD, who want to give socialism and democracy a Christian and moral tint, or the DSRP of Joseph Goebbels, reviving the spirits of past revolutions and romantic nationalism. While we could ask for more from these factions - they still retain a commitment to socialism and revolution. Worse than that - Bavaria is the home of several reactionary movements, such as the pan-Germanic agitators spreading from Austria or the terrorist Greens. \n\nAction needs to be taken - or the gap between the South and the rest of Germany will grow larger, until the point it may endanger the inviolability of our union."

The history of socialism reaches long back to the past century - and through the entire length of it, Germany has laboured towards the workers' cause, with many small and big victories against capitalism. \n\nIn the beginning of the Great War all seemed lost - the SPD was banned and its leadership jailed, for holding true to its principles and refusing to support a bourgeois war that would spill the blood of the European proletarian. Then - as Germany was losing ground, the worst years came. The military clique that seized the government was swayed over by a madman - Erich Ludendorff - who declared a total war. On the first of May in 1918, the German people could suffer no more - and rose up beneath the red banner. Against the war and tyranny the capitalists brought on Europe. \n\nIn that moment, Germany, from the darkest hell of capitalism turned into a bright torch of the new world. Our republic glows bright with hope to the oppressed masses of all continents. The example of the German people's resistance is told in the furthest corners of the globe. Everywhere where tyranny reigns, we serve to soothe the hearts and kindle a new flame. We say with pride that Germany has born the dream of world Communism, the dream of freedom and equality for all."

 GER_memory_trenches_desc:0 "The soul of our nation is collectively plagued by the memories of the Great War. The horrors of the trenches, the tyranny of Ludendorff that brought the people to revolt - all of this weighs heavy on the spirit of Germany. Those who remember say: never again. Never again should sons bury their fathers, never again should wives weep for their beloveds, never again should anyone be subjected to the foul trench existence. Never again a war.\n\nThose who fell to these feelings watch in horror, as many of the new generations call for another war - to finish off reaction in the East, or to destroy the Western hydra. Roused by skilled orators like Ernst Jünger, who glorifies the trench life, the young guard thirsts for revolutionary violence. To a great worry of the pacifists - soon, it will happen again."

Of course, he sympathised with the Austrians, but how could they expect him to risk a war with the great power for it? Germany was in no state for it, not with its barely functional army, its still recovering economy, and shattered politics.

There is a surprising amount of overlap between the political organizations given the lack of a conventional right-wing nationalist party on the German political scene. At the front of the herd is the Deutsche Sozialrepublikanische Partei (DSRP), which has been the popular standard-bearer of German nationalism since its official founding in 1923, after the leadership of Heinrich Laufenberg and Fritz Wolffheim left the SPD over issues between the Hamburg-based organization and the national program of the party. However, it also draws membership from the Gruppe Sozialrevolutionärer Nationalisten (GSRN) – now the Sozialrevolutionäre Nationalpartei (SRNP) – which was founded during the German Revolution.\n\nNaturally, there is as much to disagree about in this conglomeration as there is to unite them. While a substantial portion of the DSRP's base is rural, agricultural, and amenable to the religious socialism of the CSABPD, the party as a whole is far more leftist than the SRNP, with its roots in the western and southern side of the early revolution. In contrast, the SRNP's maximalist revolutionary nationalist program attracts a more urbane and less traditional membership, as well as being de-facto the \"soldiers' party\" due to the origin being in the soldier councils of the eastern side during the early revolution. With German politics in flux, the DSRP leadership must ask itself some important questions about this relationship. Is it time to break the formal coalition with the SRNP?

While Vladimir Lenin's uncompromising course had never seen the Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands seize the levers of power, the man's revolutionary credentials and dynamism had a magnetic effect on party unity. Without the Russian exile directing things, the KPD heads to Bremen without a course already decided.\n\n  Paul Levi's party may appear strong on the otuside, yes, but the faction under Heinrich Brandler argues that opportunities hide in the seemingly united SPD. It is clear not everyone that is dissatisfied with Levi's revisionism followed us to the KPD, and many within the SPD long for a party reminded of its revolutionary principles. If the SPD grows vulnerable, and the very real threat of a ASPD and CDABPD coalition of the right becomes a reality, the KPD could be the kingmaker of the SPD left... but it is unclear if Levi will allow them to capitalize on his weakness.\n\nUninspiring or \"realist,\" perhaps, but the Brandler faction owes some of its appeal to the brazenness of its opposition. There is another thesis advanced by Karl Radek, that the KPD can ally with other outsider parties such as the DSRP to channel nationalist grievances towards the overall struggle of the working class. Working with the SPD after its clear decay under pseudo-bourgeois bureaucrats and the bad blood of the last seven years is simply too much for many within the party and without to bear.

Without allies to the right in the ASPD, the SPD is going to need to look to more-revolutionary parties to form a government and polish their credentials as socialists. Chairman Brandler has proven amenable to being realistic in his demands. The option is open for the SPD to make a show of cooperation - perhaps in the neutral town of Weimar - and hammer out an agreement to reduce the amount of campaigning against each other, then start making plans for the future in government.\n\nBut of course, some of the party's right wing, who were mostly the architects of Levi's domestic policy, find the prospect of governing with the KPD unpalatable. The hope is that the disorganization of other potential coalitions will allow the SPD to come out of the election with a commanding plurality (or, some optimists contend, a majority) and be able to form a coalition after the fact by badgering the lesser parties into being realistic. \n\nAnd so, we must decide: to humor the KPD or not?"

The streets infront of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft lay barren of dust, the boots of students having whisked it away from constant marches infront of it. Tonight seemed to be home to another, but there was something in the air that felt different. Something electric. A few researchers stood outside the facility, eyes open. Looking. Scanning. Analyzing every detail. They had dealt with enough disruptions to their work, enough violence and street fanfare. Tonight they would push back. Tonight they would take a stand. But tonight was a poor choice of timing.\n\nHundreds of uniformed youth begun to show up, some barely in their teens. At the front, a red banner emblazoned with gold: \"Life, Liberty, Revolution.\" The Flisgesjugend had arrived. The researchers shivered, and beneath the footsteps and howls one could possibly make out a whisper asking how many had shown up this time. They had grown accustomed to the protests, the cries of \"Anti-life!\" and how they were \"subjugating love to labcoat tyranny.\" They knew they would march past this dry street, attempt to scare them into shutting down. But tonight, they would take no more of it.\n\nTonight, the march stopped. The researchers did not expect this. Slowly, as more and more youth piled and packed into the street, the march became a mob. A wolfpack. The voice of the crowd began to increase, shouts growing louder and louder. The researchers told them to leave, began shouting back, until one of them was silenced with a brick. This wasn't supposed to happen. This had never happened before.\n\nAt the sight of blood drawn by their cement comrade, the young wolverines cheered. Soon after him followed his brothers, stones and rocks pelting their enemies into submission. Walls, windows, flesh, all were valid targets, all counterrevolutionary. All were targets. But hurling pebbles was not the purpose of the night. No, tonight was celebratory. Tonight was special. For tonight, Berlin would be blessed by the holy, cleansing flame.\n\nBottles of gasoline, lit and transformed into a modern spectacle, their very own Walpurgisnacht. The Institute's books and research caught alight, offered up in the name of life itself. The heat and smoke blessed the youth, and from their mouths poured joy. Poured victory. The street became a celebration, a defiant rejection of all that the Institute stood for. A rejection of cold science, a celebration of warm life. Dancing, singing, lips pressed against eachother without regard for sex.

The Old Social Democratic party of Germany had recently enacted controversial laws... which did not ban the SRNP and DSRP and other radical and nationalist parties, but rather, forbade the use of uniforms during public gatherings. This has been met with accusations of an attempt to introduce a social-liberal dictatorship in Germany and a disturbance of the democratic order. Popper, however, reassured the Germans with a short radio speech delivered throughout the country.\n\n\"Should a tolerant society tolerate intolerance? Should we allow radicals who believe in persecuting certain groups because of their religion, culture, race or ethnicity because we believe in political pluralism? The answer is no! We do not need to tolerate them to be tolerant. It is a paradox, but unlimited tolerance can lead to the extinction of humanism, liberalism and tolerance. When we extend our tolerance to those who are openly intolerant, we give them a chance to destroy our humanist society and tolerance with it. Any movement that preaches violence and exclusiveness must be outside the law. To show our good intentions, we have only limited the formation of groups that could threaten our democracy, rather than removing certain parties from our system because they have different views. If the parties that have used these now-banned techniques are able to adapt to the new realities, they will be able to exist as democracy should be only for democrats.\"\n\nJoseph Goebbels, despite Popper's assurances of noble intentions, has stated that this is an active and conscious attack on the nationalist opposition, especially publicising his dissatisfaction by using legal forms of propaganda. However, most of the people did not view this as any real evidence of the ASPD's willingness to destroy the nationalist parties, but only extraordinary claims without any basis. Apart from the electorate of these parties, few people cared about these angry shouts. Some even decided that it would be better when no one talked about the need to remove the Jews, the greater Germany, or disturbed the quiet day with their marches in colourful leotards.\n\nBut the nationalists, in their irritation, took to the streets to protest the changes. These protests were swiftly met with police response and arrests, with wagon after wagon of uniformed men being carted away. Among those arrested was the controversial general Ernst Röhm, who is currently awaiting a sentence for organising militias and wearing party dress in a public place. Experts believe this is a method to strip these movements of the aesthetics and propaganda that draws voters to the radicals. Among the restrictions were also other methods of limiting the influence of nationalist parties such as banning the use of sharp language during speeches, prohibition of disturbing work with speeches, and a ban on non-authorised student unions. The voices of the nationalists have slowly begun to fall silent, and as the Germans return to their peaceful Status Quo, these intolerant radicals will risk dying out at some point due to lack of support."

Many members of the KPD have shown worry at the alliance given the existence of the Widukindisch faction within the DSRP led by Ernst Reventlow, who has been denounced by many as a reactionary and a chauvinist who seeks to pervert the course of the revolution. At the same time, some cadres of the DSRP have likewise denounced the KPD in turn, thinking the power sharing scheme is far too generous to their senior party.\n\nHowever, a few days ago we successfully managed to forge an unbreakable bond with the DSRP via a meeting of KPD and DSRP representatives in Bremen. Rousing speeches on both sides were heard, but most importantly there was a direct discussion between even Radek and Goebbels.\n\nAfter hours of discourse a mutual understanding was established. Radek acknowledged the importance of nationality and affirmed that the SPD's ignorance of the German nation was one of its many weaknesses. Goebbels also found common ground with Radek's belief that the executive needed to be made more firm and resolute to preserve the German revolution\n\nAfter the meeting concluded, DSRP and KPD policy makers met and, after a week of negotiation, published a joint manifesto:"

Jonas entered class, his teacher meeting him with a glare for his tardiness. \n\nThe first lesson was a boring maths lesson with old Frau Schnidtke, who had always annoyed him with her laborious tone of voice and aggressive nature. He was somewhat surprised and relieved when the school janitor entered the classroom in the middle of a lesson, interrupting Frau Schnidtke, to her visible annoyance. All the children liked him, and he would often bring sweets to school, so they naturally had no issue directing their attention to him. He twirled his grey moustache and leaned against the desk as he spoke. \n\n\"Hello! Come on, come on. Come to the desk.\" \n\nThe children quickly came closer, interested in this unusual change. The janitor was silent for a moment and then continued. \n\n\"I don't know if your parents told you about the recent changes, but I will be teaching you practical professions. Not metallurgy, although we will go on a trip to the steelworks in the future, but carpentry, at least for now. Don't be afraid of the tools of the working man, everything will be explained to you.\" \n\nThe janitor and class left the room, with Frau Schnidtke's lesson unfinished, and headed to the school shed where the janitor pulled out hammers and nails, as well as chisels and a planer. He handed them out to the children and little Jonas eagerly took the first spot in line. \n\n\"Today you will learn how to build bird feeders - that will be a good start for you.\" \n\nThey went out to the yard where everyone had a prepared place and started putting together the feeders. The janitor helped guide the students, but left the labour to them. Jonas built his feeder the fastest, and the old janitor patted him on the shoulder, saying. \n\n\"Outstanding job, comrade! This is an excellent bird feeder.\" \n\n\"Thank you Mister...\", Jonas began before realising he didn't know his last name and blushed in embarrassment. \n\n\"There is no need for misters and sirs, Jonas.

Which is why it is so worrying that your will flagged at a most crucial period.\" \n\nBrandler's face began to turn red, but he remained silent as he surely realized what was coming. And so Karl continued: \"To think that the KPD almost picked someone so willing to compromise with the social democrats, on the eve of its victory. And then your statements about our fellow strugglers who we are in the process of harnessing to the proletarian cause... Does this not reflect a deliberate unwillingness to learn? To self-critique? To march with the new direction of the party?\" \n\nRadek knit his hands together in front of his face, elbows resting on the desktop, and for a moment his eyes disappeared in the shine of his glasses. \"You can jump now, or we can push you. Maybe your friends in the SPD will pull you out of the water in the end.\" And the silence returned again as the doomed man came to grips the implications.

All this during one of the greatest storms of recent times. During such a storm, God Thor revealed himself most powerfully in all his might. Among those gathered there were both young and old, men and women, young men and children - all dressed in beautiful folk costumes. At the head of the meeting, however, one man came out, his majestic grey beard reaching his chest. His face was veiled under a hood, on which the skull of some animal was placed. As he could not see, he was leaning on a wooden cane so as not to fall. At last, however, he stretched his hand out in front of him as if he had experienced a mystical sensation, and said in a thunderous solemn voice. \n\n\"We have gathered in the sacred swamps to honour our god of vitality and thunder - Thor. Our Lord still looks on us with a furious look for our betrayal when we abandoned the faith of our ancestors in favor of a Jew on a stick and his whore mother. How will we pay off our debts towards our ancestors if not by offering it our earthly possessions?\" \n\nHe gestured with his hand to bring the artifact needed for the ritual. And no on cue, the young men carried the box on their shoulders, carrying it on a specially made litter. They could not touch her directly, as only a priest could do so or it would be an insult to the goddess. It was beautifully decorated because many ancient Germanic runes were carved on it. The priest of Thor  walked over to it, leaned over and said silently a few prayers, then opened her and turned back to the faithful, spreading his arms and taking his cane under his arm. \"Give up the formations of the ungodly capitalism which has brought degeneration and destruction to our country. Let our ancestors and gods be satisfied!\" \n\nAfter that, songs were sung in praise of the fertility mother and people were lined up. Generations of Germans, one by one, threw everyday items and luxury goods into the chest - crucifixes, food, cigarettes, books and other items that could be considered earthly. When the box was full the priest closed it and they all marched to the shore where the box was packed again into a litter. \n\n\"This litter will transport our belongings that we donated to our Lord to his domain where his kingdom is located. But his kingdom and power is not of this world, but is part of a larger and more wonderful world of spirit.\" \n\nSaid the priest as he looked over the young man picking up a litter and taking it on their shoulders and slowly bending under the weight of the chest, they started to head towards the mountain on which Thor's altar was located. It was not an easy task as the mud was all-encompassing and one careless step could mean a broken neck. The men carefully placed the litter on the altar and the priest threaded a long iron bar into the chest, several metres long. This was to draw Thunderer's attention to the gifts the people had given him. The people, the young men, and the priest watched the box as they waited for the coming of God. In the end, one thunder hit the chest and set it on fire to the accompaniment of the joyful laughs and singing of the Germans."

This has been met with accusations of an attempt to introduce a social-liberal dictatorship in Germany and a disturbance of the democratic order. Popper, however, reassured the Germans with a short radio speech delivered throughout the country.\n\n\"Should a tolerant society tolerate intolerance? Should we allow radicals who believe in persecuting certain groups because of their religion, culture, race or ethnicity because we believe in political pluralism? The answer is no! We do not need to tolerate them to be tolerant. It is a paradox, but unlimited tolerance can lead to the extinction of humanism, liberalism and tolerance. When we extend our tolerance to those who are openly intolerant, we give them a chance to destroy our humanist society and tolerance with it. Any movement that preaches violence and exclusiveness must be outside the law. To show our good intentions, we have only limited the formation of groups that could threaten our democracy, rather than removing certain parties from our system because they have different views. If the parties that have used these now-banned techniques are able to adapt to the new realities, they will be able to exist as democracy should be only for democrats.\"\n\nJoseph Goebbels, despite Popper's assurances of noble intentions, has stated that this is an active and conscious attack on the nationalist opposition, especially publicising his dissatisfaction by using legal forms of propaganda. However, most of the people did not view this as any real evidence of the ASPD's willingness to destroy the nationalist parties, but only extraordinary claims without any basis. Apart from the electorate of these parties, few people cared about these angry shouts. Some even decided that it would be better when no one talked about the need to remove the Jews, the greater Germany, or disturbed the quiet day with their marches in colourful leotards.\n\nBut the nationalists, in their irritation, took to the streets to protest the changes. These protests were swiftly met with police response and arrests, with wagon after wagon of uniformed men being carted away. Among those arrested was the controversial general Ernst Röhm, who is currently awaiting a sentence for organising militias and wearing party dress in a public place. Experts believe this is a method to strip these movements of the aesthetics and propaganda that draws voters to the radicals. Among the restrictions were also other methods of limiting the influence of nationalist parties such as banning the use of sharp language during speeches, prohibition of disturbing work with speeches, and a ban on non-authorised student unions. The voices of the nationalists have slowly begun to fall silent, and as the Germans return to their peaceful Status Quo, these intolerant radicals will risk dying out at some point due to lack of support."

A division of politics only deepened one of culture and geography. Furthermore, the multinational state has renewed a debate that resembles one of the 1800s - just how great will a greater socialist Germany be? The Slavic populations of the empire have their own national sentiments that may complicate simply absorbing the entire Empire. Alas, the inevitability of our final conflict has taken the debate over national policy out of the realm of mere theory. A choice will have to be made in the highest echelons of German government."

 germany.24.desc:0 "Arise, Czechia! In light of our decision to support Czech independence, the time has come to set up our revolutionary government in exile. However, Viennese repression of Czech nationalism and socialism has left us with a lack of pre-existing power structures to use for our own ends. Where Czech socialism exists, it has mostly been deep underground or in exile in Germany and Hungary, and increased White German settlement during the interwar is another major challenge they will face. In light of the circumstances, we have narrowed down our list of heads of state to five candidates. \n\nThe first, Václav Bolen, is an old hand of the Czech communist movement. He has always been on the most revolutionary fringe of the movement, and because of this he has been sheltering in Hungary, where he became an early convert to a dissident faction of Leninists. Faced with a diluted and abused Czech national consciousness, Bolen does not necessarily advocate for the expulsion of Germans, but has indicated that a drawing of internal borders and ethnic autonomies will be necessary to revive the revolutionary core of his people. \n\nOn the other side, Bohuslav Vrbenský is a former dentist and student activist who fell in with the anarchist and socialist movements before the Great War, even being a founding member of the Federation of Czech Anarchists. Though he had a major presence in parliamentary socialist parties, persecution in the wake of the March Actions forced him underground. Largely, Vrbenský seeks to blend his two ideological influences into a program that will take production out of the hands of the state and into the hands of workers and unions: syndicalism. \n\nJiří Stříbrný is the third to come to mind, and a long-time socialist and nationalist politician and newspaper editor. Being on the losing side of many socialist factional disputes, he would also advocate for non-Marxist socialism and corporatist economics for a time before publicly retiring from politics to avoid state persecution. While he is certainly opportunistic, Stříbrný is a self-described agrarian socialist with some pre-existing influence he can call upon outside of the socialist community. \n\nFourth, Josef Patejdl is in the odd position of being the preeminent left-wing member of the old Czechoslovak Legion. The former lawyer turned exile soldier had his hopes dashed by the failure of the Czechoslovak independence movement at the end of the Great War, and his increasing alignment with socialism led to him sheltering in Germany rather than a hostile Russia. Though not necessarily a committed Spartakist, his patriotic credentials make him a unifying figure for a transitional state. \n\nOf course, another option exists, if we were so inclined to break from our orthodoxy. Jaroslav Hašek has had a messy journey across the ideological spectrum as well as the continent of Europe itself. The Bohemian-in-both-senses novelist has had a dramatic arc, from founding the parodical \"Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law,\" to becoming a left-wing Czech Legionnaire in Russia who would flee to Germany with Patejdl at the conclusion of the Great War. Ideologically, he is something of a wildcard, having gone from anarchism to socialism and back to anarchism during his time as an exile political organiser. Perhaps he deserves his turn?"

But despite the years of electoral failure and impotent organising, Italian socialism has its chance again to be reborn — to regrow in soil soon to be fertilised by the corpse of d'Annunzio's Endeavour. But after such adversity, who could have the stones to lead?\n\nPerhaps the most obvious candidate, Lelio Basso has led a principled and dedicated career in service of the ideals of Luxemburg, tirelessly promoting them in eloquent speeches across Italy, his soft voice laced with irony ringing out across countless piazzas. None in [Root.Capital.GetName] could say that he does not deserve a spot at the top.\n\nOn the other hand, the ever-popular Carlo Rosselli could serve to bring unity to a land historically wracked with instability. Surrounded by a strong core of talented and principled people, his middle-ground between liberalism and socialism could bring stability to the peninsula where a more divisive socialist might not.\n\nBut perhaps in a nation so clearly in need of a new direction, could a firebrand be the solution? Berto Ricci, the young revolutionary and Fiumean turncoat, may be the answer to Italy's woes. His ardent determination on the overthrow of capital and the foul institutions of the Catholic Church certainly promise to bring Italy into a radically different future. The DSRP in particular seem enamoured with the uncompromising weight of his words.\n\nWhen the time comes to bring a socialist future to Italy, whose hands should that responsibility fall to?"

Enduring a brutal civil war in 1917, eight years of repression under Action Française, and now with the Artaudist coup of 1934, the idea that France's government represents its proletariat is a mere joke, and a bad one at that. For our 20th congress, we must finally address the French Question.\n\nThe current bodies of representation are not in touch with the French Proletariat, nor could they be, due to the repressive nature of French authorities. This has produced an epidemic of careerists without any vision, propelled further solely to continue the status quo. In light of this, the congress has decided to dissolve the walking husk of the SFIO, and voted to replace it with the Comité National de la France Libre, a new body representing France. Since it does not represent the French proletariat directly, but only its interests, it lacks the old SFIO's input in our congress. Furthermore, as it lacks connection to the proletariat in France, it will composed of the second best thing: French exiles in Germany. They have poured into our country over the years and they are our best insight into French nation.\n\nThe first task of the Committee will be to elect a chairperson. This will establish the tone of the body moving forward. Four people have come to the front as choices.\n\nThe first candidate is Marcel Déat: a hangover from the old careerists, he still holds sway in the congress. He proposes that France is fundamentally broken on a national level and requires an outside force to impose revolution from the top down, what he has labelled \"the constructive revolution\".\n\n The second candidate is Abbé Pierre, who fled France in 1934 after being attacked by anti-clericalists. He believes that France requires a moral more than political revival, and that this revival should be achieved through Christian love and charity. Many Catholics who were chased out of France during the Artaud coup are emphatic supporters.\n\nThe final candidate, Louis-Robert Pelletier, fled France during the AF years. He asserts a controversial thesis that the AF government was a direct continuation of Roman rule, derisively calling Maurras another Caesar. He has said that the French proletariat tends to be of Celtic stock while the French bourgeoisie tends to be Roman. Naturally, he is controversial for a seeming sympathy to medievalism and a tendency towards racialism, even if in service to socialism.\n\nThe committee is divided between the three so we must step in to break the dead-lock."

Eventually, however, the march was over, and Joseph Goebbels came out onstage to deliver his long-awaited speech. Behind him stood a towering mass, hidden beneath canvas. The suspense of what awaited under the cloth sent electric shivers throughout the crowd. \n\n\"Dear brothers and sisters of the proletariat! I stand before you, not as one who dictates, but as your humble servant. There are far greater men than me who have led the German people, and today, I wish to speak on one of them. A man of great heart and great will who fought not only for a free Germany, but a free Europe as well, and for the freedom of American slaves. Freedom was the supreme value in his life, not a selfish freedom for himself, but an unbound freedom for the whole world.\" \n\n\"It is terrible that this man has been forgotten for so long. No orders, no praise, no remembrance. This is terrible! A terrible mistake that was the fault of both Bismark's Reich, and of the SPD's Reich, two regimes not too different from one another. I stand here before you today in order to correct this mistake, so that both our ancestors and future generations can forgive us!

To show that Hecker has not been forgotten, and that the efforts of the hideous Prussian tyranny have been completely ineffective! Today, we will show the world that Hecker is alive forever!\"\n\nThe soldiers standing behind Goebbels released the canvas, unveiling a giant brass statue of Friedrich Hecker. He stared proudly into the distance, admiring the majesty of Frankfurt. To this, the crowd began clapping and cheering. Fireworks soared into the sky, forming a beautiful black-red-gold colour that stood over the monument for long after the speech was finished.

While restoring national symbols and reinvigorating the youth may be flashy, he knew it would be the changing of the structure of the republic which would be his great legacy. The arcane and chaotic way Germany had been run up until this point would destroy it given enough time. And Goebbels would go down in history for correcting all the errors of the young republic, he just knew it. With a heave, Goebbels lifted himself from his seat, and took his place at the centre podium. \n\n\"Friends, Comrades, Germans. Our beautiful fatherland faces a choice today. A choice between Bakuninist chaos and socialist order. A choice between strength and weakness. A choice between capriciousness and justice. Our current system was built on necessary and beautiful revolt, but the contingency and chance of revolt has no place in governing a republic forever. The systems set up to coordinate revolting citizens have no right to govern a stable republic. I am talking about the taboo of the republic, the Councils.\" \n\nThe Rätekongress tore itself apart in furor at the very mention of the word, with half of the assembled calling for the Premier's head, and the other half beating them back. It had been known that Goebbels had promised sweeping changes, but to touch the foundation of the republican system seemed absurd. Goebbels patiently awaited for the chamber to quiet, but as the cacophony only grew louder, he cut short the shrieks with a series of quick raps from his cane to the hardwood floor. \n\n\"While it may have seemed natural for those coming out of the Wilhelmine state to limit voting in the opposite direction as it stood before, giving only the worker in his workplace a voice, this was, and is, a monumental mistake. It is understandable why this mistake was made, as the SPD's combination of dogmatic and misunderstood Marxism confused the Dictatorship of the Proletariat as an administrative rather than as a political entity, as it is properly understood. And of course, there was the mistaken concept that the highest phase of social development would be stateless, meaning that any injustice in the current system would naturally fade with time.  But this is nothing but anarchism, antithetical to Marx! The state is a critical entity, it binds the nation, its institutions create positive freedom, and it enforces justice and law. The state shouldn't be destroyed, but perfected! And the first step is to introduce the principle of one citizen one vote! As such I am calling for a convention to write a new constitution for a stable republican future. One that is worthy of a grand German republic\" \n\nTo the SPD representatives's horror, due to careful coalitional work Goebbels was able to get enough representatives to agree to a new convention to reorder the republic."

Analyzing every detail. They had dealt with enough disruptions to their work, enough violence and street fanfare. Tonight they would push back. Tonight they would take a stand. But tonight was a poor choice of timing. \n\nHundreds of uniformed youth begun to show up, some barely in their teens. At the front, a red banner emblazoned with gold: \"Life, Liberty, Revolution.\" The Flisgesjugend had arrived. The researchers shivered, and beneath the footsteps and howls one could possibly make out a whisper asking how many had shown up this time. They had grown accustomed to the protests, the cries of \"Anti-life!\" and how they were \"subjugating love to labcoat tyranny.\" They knew they would march past this dry street, attempt to scare them into shutting down. But tonight, they would take no more of it. \n\nTonight, the march stopped. The researchers did not expect this. Slowly, as more and more youth piled and packed into the street, the march became a mob. A wolfpack. The voice of the crowd began to increase, shouts growing louder and louder. The researchers told them to leave, began shouting back, until one of them was silenced with a brick. This wasn't supposed to happen. This had never happened before. \n\nAt the sight of blood drawn by their cement comrade, the young wolverines cheered. Soon after him followed his brothers, stones and rocks pelting their enemies into submission. Walls, windows, flesh, all were valid targets, all counterrevolutionary. All were targets. But hurling pebbles was not the purpose of the night. No, tonight was celebratory. Tonight was special. For tonight, Berlin would be blessed by the holy, cleansing flame. \n\nBottles of gasoline, lit and transformed into a modern spectacle, their very own Walpurgisnacht. The Institute's books and research caught alight, offered up in the name of life itself. The heat and smoke blessed the youth, and from their mouths poured joy. Poured victory. The street became a celebration, a defiant rejection of all that the Institute stood for. A rejection of cold science, a celebration of warm life. Dancing, singing, lips pressed against eachother without regard for sex.

Furthermore, the so-called Senghorist clique is too tarred with a willingness to collaborate with Paris. The prospect of directly administering this former colony until it is ready for independence is likewise unappealing, whether due to the material cost or the smell of colonialism.\n\nHowever, considering the fate of the French Caribbean has drawn our attention to the Martiniquais exile Raphaël Etifier. A credible socialist, and an engineer with an eye for public works projects, he may be best suited to manage the region as it rebuilds."

The Artaud clique losing more with each day, this colonial periphery might soon become all that is left of the French empire.\n\nOr would become, if not the way the French concealed their imperialism – the government of the Caribbean was composed mostly of natives, particularly those belonging to the Négritude movement, closely associated with French Surrealism. Many of them have genuine socialist sympathies and a concern for the liberation of the peoples of the world, having been forced to work with the Artaud regime due to the nature of the circumstance.\n\nAs we win in Europe, we can assume a peaceful transition of power from the Caribbean Futuriste. Seeing the retreat of the French, the natives themselves have chosen Gratien Candace as the head of the new government. Comrade Candace's first decision was settling a separate peace with Germany, and assuring the Caribbean people's support in our revolutionary struggle.\n\nThe Caribbean Union eagerly joins the brotherly family of the socialists nations of the world. Arm in arm united in the struggle against all forms of imperialism!"

While the Swiss are Germans, their culture has developed rather differently, which may make integration difficult. Instead, a man came to us to propose a solution, and his name is Hans Sonderegger. \n\n A witness to dictatorship, Sonderegger argued that Switzerland needs to be federation again, after this forced experience of tyranny and centralisation. Hans also added that he could be pragmatic, and adjust his plans according to our own. The debate is on: while the Swiss will join the revolution, do we follow a gentle course of slow socialist federalization, or return to the cherished decentralisation of the Swiss, influenced with anarchist rhetoric?"

Levi's ignominy has presented the revolutionary nationalists with a golden opportunity, and the worst part is they all know it and want to be the one to lead the charge into glory! Nevertheless, despite the passionate arguments by many contenders, the leadership question has begun to revolve around two men who represent vastly different ideals and generations of the party.\n\nErnst Reventlow is the flagbearer of the old guard, so it seems, as well as the \"Widukindisch\" faction. Frustrated by the inability of the old Empire to win the last war, the former noble's views soon aligned with the councils of revolting soldiers, and by the mid 20s he had abandoned his titles and political identity. Politically heterodox, the former Count is somehow the revolutionary SRNP's most favoured candidate for the DSRP leadership due to his rhetoric of a national renewal, but also a favoured candidate of many culturally conservative socialists. His public commitment to intensified laïcité may prove alienating to some of the voters they seek, however.\n\nThe new generation, ostensibly, is represented by Joseph Goebbels. A proponent of the \"social republic\" idea, the charismatic propagandist leads the so-called \"Heckerisch\" faction of the DSRP. A romantic nationalist, the young Goebbels also calls for a renewal – a liberating revolution that evokes the dreams of 1848. His affinity for the German peasantry also gives him an improved capacity build bridges with the religious CSABPD, but his youth and lack of connections to the old GSRN guard may defer his dreams.\n\nRegardless, the party has conviened, and ballots handed and mailed out to all members of the organization. After careful tallying and consideration, the DSRP has found their new Chairman and candidate, and that person is..."

Of course, these dissidents also see a golden opportunity to take control themselves...\n\nIn a twist, the revisionist ASPD and Christian-socialist CSABPD have immediately announced a willingness to support each other should they have a chance to form government. The uproar from most other parties (save for the largely-irrelevant DDP) hints at a surprising truth - this could be the first non-SPD government in Germany in 18 years. If no other potential coalition is found, and the other parties squabble over the same voters, it will be.\n\nThis looks to be Germany's most competitive election in some time. Can the ailing SPD regain its sense of purpose? Can the radicals such as the KPD and DSRP see a way to victory for the first time? Or will inertia lead to Berlin tacking back to the center?"

Such a move is indicative of the opportunist and class collaborationist nature of the Kautskyites in the SPD.\nWe must at once reverse this decision and end any vestiges of the rule of capital and monopolists by restoring the control of the workers!

Marx did after all, highlight the proletarian character of much of the revolutions of 1848 and the concept of Social Republicanism are rooted firmly within the Socialist struggle.\nWhile we should, once again, remain wary of any reactionary tendencies in this movement, it is worth sitting down with Goebbels and from there, coordinate a possible future strategy for the government.

However, although much of our motherland stands united, there are places where this new great news will have to reach. Alsace-Lorraine, Austria and Prussia are still ruled by the foreign and anti-German forces of capitalism and oppression. Our revolution, as well as the spirit of 1848, must be eternally alive so that the essence of the German people can be eternally young and free - therefore we must not rest on our laurels, but must continue the legacy of our ancestors until all Germany and all the peoples of Europe are free."

They fail to notice that they are creating a new red empire in which the Red Kaiser represses Catholics and the Red Bismarck introduces its iconoclastic Kulturkampf. We are demanding the end of this Prussian reaction in red guise! The Church must be treated like any other institution in our country and must be tolerated.

While this \"transitional\" programme might be useful in a country where a maximum programme isn't possible, it is confusing why a socialist republic ruled by the working class would not directly pursue socialism.
