It was he who enlightened the Finnish people to their true origins, long obscured by the perversions of certain priestly characters and jealous monarchs. Aspa has promised that his reign will rival those of the greatest Pharaohs, and will bring Finland into the modern age and beyond.

Reactionaries and communists swarm around us in droves of arms, seeking to destroy everything that we have built. Finland cannot stay alone; even the most puritan of Bible-thumping whites acknowledges that. The question is, where to go?\n\nThe Intermarium is an obvious pragmatic choice, being an alliance of independent states that, similar to Finland, had fought and bled to earn their right to freedom and a better life. Their close vicinity will allow for close coordination of our armies and fast development, albeit Poland is obviously much poorer than France. On the other hand, the opponents of Finnish membership in the Intermarium concur with the notion that its member states have any real capacity to oppose a reunified Russia, should it pose an active threat to Finnish independence.\n\nThe League Solar is the obvious ideological choice, yet also a cold and distant mother. Even if we share the founding principles of the charter of Carnaro, few are looking forward to the prospect of getting dragged into a distant war where Finnish survival is not an important stake, immediately after recovering from one waged against their own sons and brothers. Sodergran's government obviously repudiates this form of pacifist defeatism as moral poison, but the reality is that more often than not, realpolitik is a force not to be trifled with.\n\nAfter much deliberation, we had chosen to make preparations with…"

Then, the day was unusually sunny and pleasant, so the streets thronged with people. The local garrison was ordered out, but the commanding officer initially refused, fearing that the mass presence of soldiers would trigger a riot. It was only after threats of hanging that he released his soldiers, who rapidly dispersed throughout the city in pursuit of small bands of Nationalist and Socialist hooligans, who were rumored to have staged various calls to arms throughout the day.\n\nThe coup did not trigger the riots, neither did the presence of soldiers. The first mass demonstration began after various hotspots of radical activity were occupied. A spur-of-the-moment decision by a trade union leader made the city go up in flames.\nDemanding immediate recension of the ban on strikes, the Union demonstration appeared as a mob, and one rapidly converging on the Governor’s mansion. Government soldiers closed the streets and ordered the demonstration be dispersed, refusing, the workers began hurling ice and rocks at the soldiers. One officer, either after being hit in the eye or tripping, ordered his men to open fire.\nAs the soldiers feared, the demonstrators overwhelmed the soldiers. The city garrison, already disintegrating due to low discipline, saw mass defections. The Governor had already fled the city a few hours earlier, but his palace was stormed and a new government was proclaimed by Socialist leaders, who had only entered the country in the preceding days.\nOutside the city, the Governor was met by a battalion of Finnish nationalists and was swiftly apprehended. newly proclaimed General Talvela declared that all Finnish patriots rally behind the remnant forces of the Duchy, to prevent a red takeover. Rural areas surrounding the city were abuzz with militia activity; already, rumors of Church desecrations and attacks on traditional Finnish sites turned them against the emerging Socialist Government.\n\nFinland burns, and the country has rapidly descended into anarchy. Whether the country be red or White in the coming years, their clash shall leave scars that will take decades more to heal."

Now, with their consolidation of power fully realised, yet one more conflict has emerged, now between Tigerstedt and Aspa.\n\nThe last of many, many gatherings concerning the future of the was about to begin. As generals, landowners, and thinkers sat down, the party leaders prepared to give their speeches.\n\nUp first was Tigerstedt. as he cleared his throat, the room fell silent. He introduced his candidate for kingship, the young Friedrich Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe, a German noble. As some scoffed at the idea, others listened intently, as Tigerstedt justified his choice of a foreign king.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity of rambling, Aspa interjected:\n\n“Oh you don’t believe any of this, do you? The king of Finland, not a Finn? Absurd!”\n\nHe took a deep breath, and continued:\n\n“The king should obviously be of Finnish stock, it’s against everything we stand for to suggest anything to the contrary.”\n\nAs the room fell deadly quiet, none dared speak.

Facing him were at least two dozen officers, who had carefully deposited their Tsarist accouterments at the door and faced their self-proclaimed leader with only the Finnish lion pinned on their breasts. They slowly began to clap, Talvela nodded curtly and stepped off.\n\nAll the assembled stood. Upon the table lay the banner of the Finnish nation; a worn flag, red, with a chipped lion at its center, its regal majesty undefiled by age.\n\n“Under this standard, my generation fought. The Russians burned these flags but did not destroy their spirit; it lives on in you, me, and all freedom-loving Finns. Lay your hands upon the flag.”\n\nTalvela’s raspy command was obeyed unanimously, each man rushing to place his around the lion. They stared into the lion’s eyes, imagining the heroes who died beneath its folds, and how they would yet see it fly.\n\n“So say we all; that this nation shall not perish into history as a mere satrapy, that its noble people shall be both free and moral, that a free Finland shall be just, faithful, and virtuous; that we may die for this freedom that we may never see!”\n\n“So say we all!”\n\nThe officers’ cry echoed throughout the hall. They were silent and still for a moment, as though paralyzed. The flag glowed, the fire seemingly animating it; they thought of death, and balked, their eyes darting to Talvela. He was calm, his visage one of cool resolve. He had faced it once, now the duty passed to them. The officers straightened."

He was a vessel emptied, there was nothing left for him to say or do; they had beaten out of him his last tear and cry.\n\nHe could tell that day that his captors knew it too. He was led not to the basement to have his fingers bored into with screws or one of his last remaining teeth knocked out, He was led outside. The sun was a welcome sight, even if it heralded death.\n\n“Today, you are to run. If you stop, cold water shall be poured onto you until you run again. This will not stop until you,”\n\nThe Okhrana agent, a new one, Janne noticed, looked down at a paper.\n\n“Ah, until you reveal where German agents are located.”\n\nIt was mid-afternoon when Janne’s legs gave out. He had scarcely stood up in prison, and now his bruised and infected legs, blood frozen upon them, had had enough. He lay on the snowy ground.

Sequestered, as he had been for – years in this little apartment hemmed in by Wybreze Kosciuszkowskie on one end and the opal lens of the Vistula on the other, he found doubts hanging off the limbs of his imagination like dead men from gallows.  Drilling his eyes into the crack beneath his door, he found this little slit between wood and wood to be slowly killing him, the continued absence of the expected letter devouring at the rims of his own future plans.\n\nHis first impulse had been to blame the landlady, a spindly child of Congress Poland who viewed everything to the east of the Marshal’s frontier as unambiguously Muscovite.  Hearing that her new tenant hailed from Helsingfors, she had begun using him as a pincushion for all the aggression she had built up prior to her homeland’s independence: undercooking his meals, sloppily making his bed, and, yes, sitting on his mail for an agonizingly long amount of time.  He had tried many times to correct this hostility between them, looking up from his cold dinner he would tell her, martialing the very limits of his command of the Polish language, “Jestem Finem, a nie Rosjamen.  Musisz zrozumiec, ze nienwidze ich tak samo jak ty.  Widzisz, to nie jest rosyjskie nazwisko: R-u-u-t-o.” But this would break otiosely against the grimacing face of his patriotic landlady and she would leave him to eat in silence.\n\nHe had eventually been able to discipline his imagination beyond these memories of domestic betrayal only to have a new permutation of his paranoia intervene.  Here it was on his own letter, the one he had sent months ago and the reply to which was hopefully heading towards the crack beneath his door.  Now he saw his letter being taken to Danzig, carried by a sympathetic crewman of this or that cargo liner across the cracked ice flows of the Baltic, only to be intercepted by a Tsarist policeman on the docks of Helsinki who would read through it and trace the location of its recipients, silently thanking poor old Yrjo Ruuto for imbecilically condemning his comrades to slaughter and crushing any hope for the Revolution and Finl-\n\nWith a grumble he hears the landlady passing by, the sound of her shoes halting at his door for just enough time for a pale white envelope to slide beneath it."

It is evening, the thin horizontal remainders of sunlight are molding the pass men into a cold geometry of shadow, faces hidden beneath the peaks of foresting caps and diagonal slant of rifles resting on shoulders.  You regard them, all of them, with a sort of sacred awe.  The atmosphere here is ritualistic, there’s the residue of transfiguration leaking into the air as each soldier steps towards his possible death, opening himself to the raw currents of danger and rising above it all through sheer will and dedication to his fatherland.  They’re marching through the terrestrial hell of War.  You will be there with them.  In the moments of dread, as the Earth turns pale and fractured beneath the sting of artillery fire and lead, you will watch your men draw fire from your eyes- The men with black banners, the soldiers of Ornulf Tigerstedt.\n\nEurope’s great epics detail a hero’s apotheosis through war.  Odysseus on the beaches of Troy, Dante - who held in his breast the soul of the hero - ablaze in Hell, Roland at Roncevaux.  This is the world you live in, the world only you and a few others of your caliber possess the strength to see, one whose mysteries lie beneath pools of onyx blood.  But now, no such men are around, you must summon them into this land.  Next you is General Talvela, a pale monolith of epaulets and campaign medals, whose rigidly authoritative demeanor has been ever so slightly defused by the evening chill coloring his nose and jowls a pearly red.  Beyond him, you can see Aspa rocking back and forth.  He catches sight of you staring at him and halts himself, leaning behind Talvela’s back to meet your gaze.  “Ornulf!  Ornulf!  It is beautiful, such power!  Like the march of the maryannu through Luxor!”  You turn away and leave him to his impotent ramblings, once more turning to face the procession of troops.  Closing  your eyes, you allow the world to dissolve into the aural paintwork of boot against pavement – the sound of a new world snapping into place.

This was an opportunity that had floated around his mind in the previous weeks with revelrous anticipation.  He, in his woolen commissarial coat burning away at the false consciousness with his words imagining, with perhaps the slightest hint of guilt, himself as prometheus delivering revolutionary fire to the darkened masses, opening their eyes just as his own had been opened during those nights at university in Helsinki when he communed with Marx, Sorel, Lenin through ink and pages.  Instead there was silence, the peasants would stare at him bored and confused; his long diatribe against the landowning class, about the nuances of surplus and proletarianization, colliding with their dull eyes without making the slightest of indentations on their brains.\n\nThe approach was wrong.  He knew there was still a vital bolt in the heads of each of these peasants preventing them from realizing the truth of his words, from seeing the light he was desperately attempting to shine on them.  Pausing for a moment, diving into the archives of his theoretical literacy, rolling his head in slight discomfort as the afternoon Sun continues to singe his neck, rifling through the thoughts of other people for an explanation of his problems.  Then he finds it, almost tripping over it in his mind, in one of Marx’s critiques of Hegel, early 1840s; “Religion is the opium of the people.”  As soon as this quote rises to the forefront of his mind it immediately elucidates all his frustrations.  Christianity is the stitching holding together the sedate compliance of these peasants, and he has been called to dethrone it.  With renewed energy he resumes his sermon:  “You may notice that whenever you begin to find your discontents rumbling to the surface your landlords, your rulers and oppressors, invoke the ‘spirit of Christian charity.’  They hide beneath the warm covers of an invented God, claiming that the words and favor of this superstitious spirit allows them to forev-”\n\nBefore he can finish he feels something, a cold lightning strike, tearing against his forehead and knocking off his budenovka.  He reels, thrashing backwards and falling from the stool; something has begun to wet the dry ground beneath his head.  And then they’re on him, knuckles and boots cracking against his skin, raising little mountains of abused flesh and writhing blood on his face.  He could feel the blood, blood flowing up and down his body, pouring into its empty cavities like a bathtub.  Even as he screams and pleads he thinks they won’t kill him, he continues to think it for a while, it’s his last thought even.  As rocks and fists split the bone and flesh from his skull, his consciousness deforms into a cold mass of blackened sludge only dimly aware of its own imminent extinction, and soon the very notion of pleading for help vanishes within its nocturnal depths.\n\nHis final moments were spent as a wriggling, vomiting, bleeding body, the last guerrilla effort of a disorganized and abandoned life attempting to assert itself in the decaying halls of its host.  This too faded in time; the villagers retreated down to the lake to wash from their hands and clothes the blood of the putrescent balloon of flesh which now ornamented the center of their beloved village."

Here, among our own, we can tap into the energies of our ancestors!”, explained Pharaoh Aspa to King Farouk of Egypt. \"I am now speaking from Pharaoh to Pharaoh..You know what I am talking about!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed! I appreciate your passion for my realm. Our land, like our pyramids, has always prevailed against its enemies. Here, in the valley of the Nile, we resisted against both the surrounding desert and the desolation that invaders brought to our country. What you have in front of yourself here is a testament to our glory.\"\n\n\"And so much more! These are the tombs of our predecessors. We are the Sons of Ra! You must know all of this!\"\n\n\"Indeed, I am aware of my position and my duties. Under my reign, I will see that Egypt will return to its place of preeminence among the realms of this world. You must have seen the murals erected to celebrate my wedding.\"\n\n\"When I did, I felt as if the times of Ramses came back. It must be a sign of the times.. We are great men destined to take charge of the times and steer them to a new golden age. You told me about Egypt, let me tell you about Finland.\"\n\nAspa paused to assume a proud stature, then saw a struggling peasant with the corner of his eye. Instantly forgetting about his speech, he rushed to the ill-fated peasant. \"You, befallen son of the Nile, let me help you! I am Pharaoh Aspa of Finland, your brothers from the North! I am a global genius and I will make sure your carriage will never break down like this ever again!\"\n\nThe Finnish monarch began analysing the broken cart, while the speechless local couldn't even understand what was going on. King Farouk finally reached the two men. \"Your Majesty, this man's cart is broken! A proud Egyptian can't live like this! He deserves the most modern technology at his disposal! But we're in luck, I brought a spare motor and wheels to experiment in my little free time here. I will send a man right away!\"\n\nTrue to his word, one of Aspa's attendants returned with the engine and the wheels, and the genius monarch began tinkering. The final product turned out to be beyond the comprehension of the bystanders. The car wheels and the motor were attached to the wooden cart, a contraption of which Aspa was particularly proud. He presented it to the confused peasant, who did not know what to make of it. He approached his cart, trying to find a way to make it move. But he barely touched it, when the whole structure collapsed under the weight of the attached engine. The bystanders turned their eyes to Aspa, who quickly replied:"

 fin.10.desc:0 "Clad in Kemetic garb, Aspa sat on a stool, staring at himself in the mirror. Still as one of the many statues of himself adorning the centre of Helsinki as the man acting as the archpriest put the final hieroglyphs across his face. Spells from the Book of the Dead, exactly as was written on the linen wrapped around the mummies of the great ancient Pharaohs. As the ad-hoc archpriest finished up, on his forehead Aspa wrote one last hieroglyph himself: an eagle, the symbol of Horus.\n\nAspa rose from the backroom and with powerful gait emerged onto the podium, on it a throne of sandstone adorned with paintings of scenes from ancient myth, both Finnish and Egyptian. A headdress sat upon the throne. A sea of spectators stretched out into the horizon, eagerly awaiting the coronation. Though cloudy, the day was comfortably mild.\n\nThe archpriest slinked out from behind Aspa and motioned for the crowd's attention, though he knew the endless horde was already waiting with bated breath.\n\n\"Brothers! Loyal subjects of our splendid kingdom! We are gathered here today as the world enters into a new era, as Finland and Egypt are again united, as our Pharaoh is anointed.\" Aspa gently picked up the headdress from the throne, handing it to the archpriest.\n\nAfter receiving it, he continued: \"I do proclaim you, Georg Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa, Pharaoh of Finland, Conduit Between the Gods and Earth and Their Loyal Servant, Living Incarnation of Horus on the Mortal Plane, Keeper of the Black and Red Lands, Guarantor of Truth and Harmony, Fighter of Disorder and Troublesomeness, Commander-in-Chief of All Armed Forces, He Who Commands the Flooding of the Nile, Captain of the Boat of Millions of Years and the Highest Spiritual and Intellectual Authority on Earth.\" With the speech over, the archpriest crowned Finland's new Pharaoh as he sat upon his throne.\n\nA squad of armed men marched out onto the podium, their uniforms adorned with gold. The first soldier came bearing the Case-Meke, a decree from Thoth proclaiming the Pharaoh the heir of the God of the Earth. The next held the Sceptre-Heqa, a shepherd's rod to represent the pastoral aspect of the Pharaoh. The third man offered the Flail-Nekhekh, a flyswat. The soldiers continued to give holy regalia until the final man arrived with the Sceptre-Was, representing power and dominion over the land.\n\nAspa banged it on the floor of the podium before raising it up to the sky, diverting the eyes of the crowd up to it."

The doctor, a so-called “fennologist” or a similar convoluted academic term he could not quite afford to remember, quickly put it away, jumping around in a display of theatrics equivalent to an elk put in front of a hunter's ironsight. It was amusing, the man could not be much younger than him, yet he moved with the erratic vigour expected of someone a third of either of their ages.\n\n“Aha! Perfect, perfect! Simply wonderful, yes. You can move again, Jari!”\n\nJari, his assistant and boy no older than twenty, moved much slower in contrast. The youth's hands circled around the peasant's face with rhythmic motion, slavishly and somewhat robotically, constantly shoving tweezers and measuring tools and calipers and only God knows what else around his scalp and chin. The peasant, of course, had absolutely no idea what was going on. The older doctor simply sometimes rhetorically assaulted the young man with incomprehensible scientific jargon and, after receiving a satisfactory response, wrote something down on a typewriter. He could not say that he had hated these “checkups”, however. Quite on the contrary. When was the last time people like him received more than an ounce of something from the government?\n\nNow, a civil war had gone down with the cityfolk, one he was naught but an observer to, and things were different. Not only could he actually understand government officials, they were also eager to bury him with gifts for practically nothing in particular. How could he, the simple son of a farmer, hate this?\n\n“... And how many children did you say you have?” The scientist interjected, one of the many questions periodically interrupting the procedure.“Alex, Luukas, Toimi, Panu, Arvi, Ilmo…little Tarja, how could I ever forget her! They are all waiting in the hall, alongside my wonderful wife. You already met them when we arrived, aren't they wonderful?” The peasant replied, his gaze almost starry-eyed at the recollection of his flesh and blood.\n\n“All those children are yours?” The old scientist retorted back, with an equal if not far bigger enthusiasm and, upon a nod of confirmation, clasped his hands in amazement. He rose from his chair, hurling commands at his assistant.\n\n“Jari, hand this champion of Kalevala the monetary compensation he rightly deserves! This titan! Hero of ancient myth!” Turning to the peasant, he continued in a much quieter tone. “Just for bureaucracy's sake…what was the village you said you were from?”"

Kullervo's tale is one of a more tragic kind than what Finnish myth usually offers, and yet…”\n\nThe guide continued to blabber on, in a particularly high and mighty, scholarly tone. Thomas could register every second word of what she had said, not even bothering to feign interest, unlike the rest of his entourage. “All of it is gonna be total propagandist nonsense”, Rick said, and he had no reason to disagree. Nor did he hear anything that would prove this assertion wrong. The guide, for her part, made a much more stimulating display of her figure than anything the hotel had to offer…at least on the inside. The outside was weird, for the lack of a better word.\n\nNothing like what he saw in the states. Thank fuck. Even if those CNAC weirdos were nothing but pseudo-Futurians and egotistical Shlomos, they did have, at the very least, a sense of style appropriate to American tastes. What he saw was almost satanic in its conception. A huge sprawling toward, ziggurat-like, with spikes and ornate layering adorning its walls. Horror flicks evoking bronze gargoyles spread along the gates. A fountain with a marble statue of a caveman raising his club high in the centre. In contrast, the interior was almost…kitschy? For the lack of a better word. Baroque paintings, medieval armour, animal heads on display…if he saw this in the Big Apple, he'd assume the owner to be either one of the really artsy sodomites, or at least just very passé. Maybe this is what's considered “modern” for an Asiatic country…fair enough. Hard to make it into an engaging exposition, though. Thomas reached down into his pocket, thinking he could wash the time down with some smoke.\n\nThe guide stopped abruptly, turning to fix him with a glare so intense it felt like a dagger to the heart."

 fin.13.desc:0 "Finland is a nation that takes its celebrations seriously. From festivals dedicated to the harvest to the innumerable Saints days, Finns have taken every turning of the year and day of remembrance and turned them into an opportunity for cavorting, merriment, and feasting. The Christmas season is no different, and, in many ways, it encapsulates the merrymaking spirit of the Finns.\n\nThus, the strange impositions and bizarre neologisms thrust upon and inserted into this year’s celebrations have engendered a great deal of confusion, as well as tepid experimentation. Staunch in his belief in Perennialism, the Pharaoh has “revived” many “lost” traditions, including the lighting of a torch signifying the eternal cycle of death and rebirth, as the fire slowly dies until the heralding of the New Year. There have likewise been introduced numerous old pagan traditions; public appearances of traditional Saints and spirits have assumed a strange atavistic quality, with many assuming Egyptian-inspired garb.\n\nPerhaps the oddest feature of the new celebrations has been the riverside ceremonies heavily imbued with Osirian imagery, with the Ancient God’s journey also commemorated in new stage plays and even a film funded by Aspa’s Government. Most strangely, the new buildings constructed in Aspa’s bizarre styles have various displays of Osiris illuminated by the sun, with various special construction purposes now revealed as directing sunlight like in the manner of the God’s Temple at Thebes."

 fin.14.desc:0 "The area around the formerly Imperial and now Royal Palace in Helsinki had been littered with thousands, uncountable masses of people swarming at the gates, no matter the age or class. At the front was the clergy in black robes adorned by purple sashes joined with national colours solely for the occasion, each of them assisted by a brigade of guards wearing anachronistic gilded armour reminiscent of the Thirty Years War—the so-called cavaliers. After them stood the actual soldiers, perfectly orderly and adorned in metal of their own. Then the photographers and politicians and afterwards, those who had simply taken part in the crowd.\n\nIn spite of this commotion, it had been almost eerily quiet. Not a peep was heard, no fighting or arguing over anything, no yells accosting pickpockets or hysteric women demanding that someone please help their poor son. Nothing at all. Only the chill and the cruelty of the cold, open air. If someone had accidentally dropped a purse or their glasses or anything similar, all eyes were momentarily on them. It was as if instead of human biomass, an elaborate machinery was set in motion, one capable of consistently correcting and shaming itself should it ever falter.\n\nThousands of eyes stood in silence, awaiting elaborate directions from someone deemed more important than them. And all of them fell on a particular man. Friedrich Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe stood perfectly still in front of a carpet, dressed in an outfit befitting a 17th-century gentleman, before a short ceremonial tune gestured him forward. He had come before the archbishop, the two men only exchanging narrow, motionless glances before the elderly man of faith gestured for the king to kneel, placing a newly forged crown of sheet metal upon his head.\n\nWhat followed were not joyful jeers of jubilation and celebration. The crowd had lowered its heads and closed its eyes, each and every one of them joining in reciting a solemn prayer of mercy. After all, mercy was to be reserved exclusively for God now.

Returning, he found all his childhood memories rendered useless by the scene before him.  The old Helsinki had been pulverized and replaced with something darker, more self consciously monumental.  Vast tracts of open land spread outwards in a strict and regimented pattern, buttressed on each side by some sort of architectural hybrid between fortress and palace.  Looking at it all from the outside he couldn’t possibly imagine anyone inhabiting these buildings, they seemed to him like some revenant fragment of the Middle Ages trying to disguise itself for the Twentieth Century, or perhaps the other way around.  Either way, it cultivated an awe that was entirely external.\n\nHis whole village, and much of the population of the villages surrounding Helsinki, had been summoned here today for what was promised to be a set of festivities.  So far, however, the only thing that had been brought forward to entertain them was a continual stream of black clad troops marching mechanically down the oceanic boulevards as a great tide, disrupted and split occasionally by formations of motorcycles, armored cars, formations of planes flying overhead.  It was interesting initially to Vaino, but the novelty had worn off.  It wasn’t as if he hadn’t seen any of these things before; during the Civil War his village had become intimately acquainted with all of them - although, admittedly, seeing them lead docilely across the city had a certain catharsis.  No, for the past hour or so, Vaino had been casting his eyes up to a balcony affixed to one of the supreme buildings, on which stood a figure clad in an ornate black robe, a human raven almost, who spent the entire parade in a trance-like stillness.  Watching him, Vaino almost felt this hypnotic effect contagious, so much so that he hardly noticed that the parade grounds had cleared.\n\nThe emptiness of the grounds persisted for five or so minutes before being punctuated by a distant grow.  From both ends Vaino saw two tanks, heavily built and armored, creeping towards each other before halting at an equidistant point.  Raising their barrels, two respective shots are fired into the air in unison before the two metal behemoths begin racing towards each other, colliding in a cacophonous groan of steel and fluttering of sparks.  They wrestle with each other for a bit, moving within a spiral before one, and Vaino has trouble telling which exactly, unleashes a shell at point blank, ensconcing the two in a corolla of smoke and leaving both slouched and inoperative.  Looking up at the black figure on the balcony, Vaino for a moment thinks he can detect the slight glint of teeth on the inky canvas of its human form."

We have supposedly “progressed” past that time, but that delusion must be left behind. Science is what the Pharaohs and the cults truly practiced. The works of the Gods were made manifest in the natural processes, made knowable by study, but imbued with their power nonetheless.\n\nEmerging out of the universities, the voice of the Old Gods ushers forth, offering many rewards for the visionary. Machines can transform how we move, see time, think feel, and perceive. Knowledge of good breeding can create the superhuman, birth a generation of great philosophers and engineer warriors. It can shift rivers, drain lakes, flatten mountains, and raise valleys. The old Gods have returned, offering their creative and destructive power to the modern man, if only he wishes to take it."

It is impossible to replicate American capitalism in a nation so limited as Finland, but with new lands soon to be conquered and a burgeoning economy, it should not be too difficult.\n\nCreating an environment conducive to the creation of men like Thomas Edison or Henry Ford requires a certain fatality, which only the potentiality of failure endemic to challeng Capitalism can create.

Armed with the arsenal of modernity, with the power of the tractor, with the new techniques of fertilisation of the soil, with modern electric hydro-power, the Finnish peasant will be able to fully realise his potential.

Extensive extraction operations could yield a great bounty, one that could fill the demand not just for Finland, but for the world. It has been said that gold is useful for far more than mere currencies, and if that is true, Finland would be the first nation to capitalize on the inevitable rush for the substance.\n\nAs such, we shall send experts north, and give them all they need to find any evidence of the precious metal."

It is no less savage, certainly. The very architecture harasses the soul, contaminating it with greed and wrath. It is not of the Finnish people, but contrary, oppressive of them.\n\nIf we are to ever rise again as a nation we must cast off the shackles that moor us to capitalist cosmopolitanism; we must have a Finnish architecture that is of the land, that bespeaks of the people’s sorrows and victories, we must build so that the great men of tomorrow may build."

Yet, it is in this hour of dreadful need that a hero has arrived.  Ornulf Tigerstedt, mounted upon his black steed and carrying a black banner, has descended upon Helsinki to reignite the flame which once burned so mightily within the soul of our people.\n\nThe promise of greatness he offers is not a gift but a challenge, the painful writhing of Finland to rise above its languishing state and walk in the sun.  It is a challenge, Tigerstedt has made clear, which only the most noble and strong of our nation are fit to achieve.  Yet is it not that noble and strong who are the axles of history’s wheels?

Stepping inside, one entered an impossible geography of glass and stone that served as a goblet to a swirling and abyssal cosmos of awe.\n\nNow a new cathedral is taking shape, one which shall loom over the black firs and white snow of Finland, blotting out even the sun itself as the supreme source of wonder for our people.  But this cathedral, unlike its ruined predecessors which dot the Continent, is not built from stone, but is, you see, a fairy tale, or a miracle.

We shall strip away the oh-so-courteous sentimentalism which hitherto has been the lodestar for Finnish man, be it the puerile and saccharine agrarian pining of Conservatives, or the egalitarian sorrow mongering which bursts from the tear ducts of Socialists, and in its place assemble steaming souls of hyenas to realise the beauty of the taut muscle and glimmering tooth.

That these things are even considered to be separate is itself a rusted artefact of liberal frivolity that paints man as a gyrating speck of dust afloat in the empty universe which spat him out.  The result of this corrosive vision is that we have less of a nation and more of a territory filled with myopic simpletons unable to see beyond the steeple of their local church.  Indeed, one wonders how such people are even able to tell day from night when the Sun and Moon lie so far away.\n\nWe may now finally play a funeral dirge for such idiocy.  In the cathedral of the new Finland there is only one god who commands the attention of its congregants: the state.

This thraldom to nature, its filthiness, weakness, conduciveness to matriarchal metaphor, remains a manacle tightly squeezing the Finnish brain until it cannot think at all, and one which must be shattered.  Under our new regime of pure power, the lakes of Finland shall be as barrels of wine, its forest steaks to the gnashing teeth of chainsaws.

The idiotic dichotomy between modernism and reaction is easily one of the most poisonous forces on the Finnish right and Tigerstedt has taken upon himself the task of administering the antidote.\n\nA new aesthetic will be ushered into Finnish life, one which synthesises the technical power of modernity with the spiritual force of reaction, cathedrals illuminated by electric lights, trolleys coursing through the winding streets of our ancient cities, tank battalions animated by the sacred ethos of the Hakkapeliitta, and much more.

It is to these superhuman heroes, with their beautiful voices unsullied by the nonsensical rambling of “the people,” that we must turn to for tutelage in statesmanship.  Their words and actions, swept across the canvas of history like paintbrush mounted on a sword, hovers above us and appears in our deepest dreams as the siren song of greatness.  Finland now has a leader who can answer such a call, who can climb above the morass of wasting humanity and carry cleansing fire in his bare hands.

Holding no tolerance for sin or deviance, fearless in battle, yet filled with holy fear before the Lord, the Caroleans embodied the great inner discipline which serves as the mark of all great men.\n\nIn this regard, the Caroleans bear the great insignia of nobility which we wish to advance, one not of petty titles of blossoming cockades, but instead a reflection of deep inner power that rises from the depths of men who seek to prove their own greatness before God and Sovereign. Thus, Tigerstedt has arranged for our own military to begin discarding its previous doctrines and structures in favour of those employed by the Caroleans: a strict adherence to meritocracy, the flourishing of a esprit de corp, and a pivot towards highly aggressive shock tactics, shall be implemented as we look to the past to overhaul our military might for whatever the future holds."

To be “authoritarian” is simply to hold a reverence for authority; this, ostensibly horrid, proposition has often been interpreted to simply mean the deployment of boots and batons across the face of all mankind, an idiotic and simplistic notion.\n\nTo be “authoritarian” means not only an endorsement of political or religious authority, but also a belief that the individual, by the strength of his own liberty and will, should cultivate an authority over his own self.  This power of self mastery we champion is a more fruitful form of liberty than that proposed by the liberals, whose fetish for “liberty” entails nothing more than slavery to vice.  By contrast, it is we who truly believe that every man must be his own master, and while without a doubt great swaths of our population are not up to the task, it is by that mastery, that “dreaded authoritarianism,” that true freedom is achieved."

A variety of factors have contributed to this tragic dwindling of true Christians, but those most lethal was certainly a gradual reorientation within the faith, a pivot from righteousness to mercy as the guiding star of the Christian soul.\n\nA Christianity that remains so infatuated with weakness is hardly Christian at all, it is not the spirit Christ carried with him when he cast the merchants out of the temple, it is not what inspired Paul to embrace Christ, it is most definitely not what propelled crusading knights to shed their blood in defence of the faith.

When the Judeo-Futuro-Spartakists seized Helsinki, bringing untold horrors of the Red Terror on their own countrymen, General Paavo Talvela led his own Black Guards and White Banners north, meeting their cowardly treason with unbreaking tenacity like a fearless wolf. And when the Red Menace was eventually driven out with an unending flood of bayonets, one thing was clear: General Paavo Talvela saved Finland from a doom of its own making. No Finn still living embodies the values of Sisu more than our general, and the Finnish people will accept no one else to take his place. General Paavo Talvela has won Finland's war; now's the time for Paallikko Paavo Talvela to win its peace."
 FIN_unleash_wild_hilja_desc:0 "The salvation of a nation requires more than mere words. It demands an iron will to resist weakness and Spartakism, a truth known by none better than Hilja Riipinen, beyond perhaps the Paallikko himself. Despite being no soldier of her own, instead serving as a politician and a teacher, Riipinen has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the triumph of Patriotic-Nationalism over the falsehoods of Communism. As the Minister of Education, she is prepared to exert every effort to rectify the situation. After all, who better understands discipline than the Headmistress? Under the watchful eye of ‘Wild Hilja’, no Red shall evade her gaze or escape the reach of her rifle."
 FIN_finland_goes_dry_desc:0 "Alcohol is a bane upon humanity, making worthless bums out of men and whores out of women. It attracts other social ills such as communism, cosmopolitanism, jewry or atheism on top of itself like a rotting carcass, its stench a disgusting odour on the honour and glory of our country. It encourages Finns to scream, to kick and to shout, to avoid work and to curse God with their breaths. No more! This ugly abomination shall be taken out of stores immediately, its distribution stopped and all existing supplies burned. The Bible lays it out clearly, just turn to Galatians 5:19–21: “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.” Who are we to argue with what had been clearly spelled out by the Lord?"
 FIN_no_mercy_for_the_reds_desc:0 "Thank God for our Paallikko, for without him, the traitorous socialists would have sold Finland to Berlin and their internationalist machinations. Yet even though we have quashed those insolent swine, there are many black-hearted reds still subverting our regime. Some of them hide behind innocent-sounding names, and claim to be for “welfare” and the “common good of society” - yet would betray our great nation to the red menace in a heartbeat if it meant they could enact their degenerate fantasies. No more will they be allowed to preach their odious claptrap in our streets! Under our rule, the Judeo-Spartakists, futuro-Bolshevists, and their lotus-eating sympathisers will be delivered true justice - no mercy will be shown to these abominable enemies of Finland."
 FIN_nordic_discipline_desc:0 "In this world of drifting allegiances and backstabbers, where shall poor Finland go? Into the storm of foreignness, where homogeneity and brotherhood go to perish in unremarkable, forgotten deaths, or towards the flock of mother Frigg, queen of Asgard, where every son is a Siegfried in his own right, and they all fight as one? For the Patriot, who loves and cherishes his way of life, the answer is clearly: Who else can provide for us, if not our fellows of blood, the Brethren of the Birch Oak? We had struck our own dragon of Socialism, yet many others remain, hungrily gazing upon poor old Scandinavia. Is it not just to help those affected by them? Our Nordic kin had done much to advance Finnish interests, and now it's time for Finland to repay the debt."
 FIN_patriotic_league_of_women_desc:0 "Do not be deceived by the spiel promoted by screeching Bolshevik crones like Edith Södergran. While there is no Adam without Eve, there is also no Eve without Adam. Globalist Feminism, this bane upon womanhood, has no place in the minds of any patriotic Finnish lady. Instead, they shall strive to be like General Riipinen: a mother, yet a warrior and a patriot in her own right, a dedicated woman of God who would, in times of great crisis, gladly raise her arms and kill or die for her fatherland. Some covetous Russophiles take the opposite side of the Spartakists, demanding petite mademoiselles they can freely violate in their fits of alcoholic, ape-like rage. Nonsense. A Finnish woman can only ever be a lioness, just as a Finnish man can only ever be a lion."
 FIN_eugenic_hygiene_program_desc:0 "A healthy race means a healthy face. What kind of nation are we, if we allow the weak, the feeble, the good for nothing to further spread their defective genes, diluting the population with their physical hubris? Are we the nation of a million Andre Bretons, who nurture their negroes like an impressionate girl nurtures a stray puppy to health? Are we the nation of a thousand Piłsudskis, who grow grey hair thinking of thousand and more ways to nurture whatever abomination crawled beyond the Urals into a functioning, developed human? I say no! No and no and no! We are Finns. The genetic best of Germanic aristocrats and Finno-Ugric warriors, nurtured to a great avalanche through thousand years of selective breeding. And by God, we shall not surrender this honour anytime soon."
 FIN_progress_not_socialism_desc:0 "As Finns, we stand between two worlds: one of Moscow, of cultural and social decay, where the capitalist idiocy of Stolypin's regime stands like an anchor firmly buried into the ground for the sole purpose of preventing the fleet of Nationhood setting sail, and the other of Berlin, of collectivist incompetence and cultural cancer, where no ship, let alone our little Finland, can even dream of exiting the drawing board of selfish imagination. But the ship must sail. There is no way around, so what shall we do? Neither of these directions is even slightly fit for the voyage. The answer, as always, happens to be quite simple: We cut the rope binding the ship to the anchor. We cut down every Bolshevist dreamer who would wish to encumber, devalue, and destroy her with his meaningless babble. We grip the wheel of the economy as one people, one state, and one nation. And once all of that is done, we sail through the storm.\n\nIn our new Finland, there is no room for selfishness, but neither is there room for entitlement. The state shall feed those who are hungry, build roads for those who cannot easily walk, and melt down the gilded chains of the few in favour of the prosperity of the many. To label this “Socialism” would be the highest form of ignorance a human could possibly achieve, for there is neither “revolution” nor “the world” in our sights: only Finland."
 FIN_god_luther_fatherland_desc:0 "The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. In spite of a flood of scowls from pseudo-pagans such as Wettenhovi-Aspa on one side, and pseudo-papists like Tigerstedt on the other, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland stands firm. After all, why should we denounce our faith, when it has nurtured and shielded us from harm for so long? It had been only thanks to God above that our Paallikko survived numerous hardships facing him, and for that we cannot be more grateful. Faith alone guides our steps in building structures that shall shield from any danger and scripture alone separates us from the civilization null of judocratic primates that stand to our east. Without grace or Christ, we are nothing but meaningless husks of flesh, not unlike our Spartakist “compatriots”. All that we are, all that belongs to us, is nourished by the glory of God alone."
 FIN_against_spiritual_bolshevism_desc:0 "The crooked agents of Warsaw, Baku, Fiume and Le Soleil have spread to Finland a most abhorrent plague, that of Futuro-Bolshevist decadence. The so-called avant-garde claim to be for progress and modernity, yet they do nothing but weaken our people’s spirits and infect them with degenerate and deviant ideals. These insolent “poets”, “artists”, and “writers”; even those who claim to be ‘apolitical’, are a fifth column of Bolshevism, their so-called “art” the ravings of the mad and the sick - and they deserve to be treated as such. In the new Finland, art will not be meaningless, degenerate, or pessimistic - it will serve to inspire optimism and strength in the new generation of Finns."
 FIN_homes_of_healthy_culture_desc:0 "It seems today that all you see, especially in the cities, is naught but constant violence and debauched sexual perversion. Though we had won by arms, the people's minds are far from properly won. Our youth often live for decadence, mental poverty that incites you to rebel against God, to embrace Russianess, and the values of Marx or D'Annunzio. This new norm, corrupt and baseless, has to cease. The people need wholesome values, ones rife with faith and patriotism. Many pioneers had already established clubs, societies, events, et cetera for this exact purpose. All they need is our funding and our faith. Once the youngins know proper Finnish values, our future might as well be secured."
 FIN_rally_kosolas_men_desc:0 "“Save the rod, spoil the child,” or so they say. But when the “child” in question is over thirty years of age and has changed a stick for a rifle and the red banner, a rod is too thin. Vihtori Kosola is a respectable man and a good patriot. His men proved their bravery beyond the field of politics, taking the stand and cramming whatever they could down the throats of disgusting communistic freaks. Just in Lapua, they had lynched dozens; in other cities, a couple hundred more. Armed with clubs and love for their country, Kosola shall lead his men down every city in our great nation, until every corner and crevice is free of the ugly filth that we had allowed to plague it for so long. Such heroism, of course, cannot go unrewarded by the Paallikko. Remember, boys, a dead Red is a shining medal on your chest's worth of work!"
 FIN_the_homesteaders_rights_desc:0 "An areal approach must be taken to the issue of residual Russian influence; it is not enough to merely pick off individual landowners one by one, there must be a concentrated effort to sweep away the hostile class and return Finland's land to Finnish folk.\n\nThe land seized from the Muscovite shall be given to our loyal soldiers, those who fought anti-white troops and liberated the country from the clutches of Petrograd and Berlin both. The rights of the soldier who has laid down his rifle in favour of the pitchfork shall be forever protected, ensuring he shall not have to take up arms against collectivisation or nationalisation.\n\nAnd to aid our soldier and Finland's long-suffering farmers more generally, a vast array of tax cuts shall be instituted. It is decreed: No more handouts for leeches or loungers!"
 FIN_heroes_of_liberation_war_desc:0 "Many men served to uphold Finland during the war and the cost was blood, for some their ability to do the most normal of human actions, and for some their lives. We cannot let the brave soldiers of Finland unnoticed and left to wallow in pain for eternity.\n\nWe must lend a hand to them, give them what they deserve for their deed. They should feel welcome to live in normalcy again, to feel pride in the fact they were Finnish.\n\nWe will guarantee that they can establish and raise their families. Benefits in pays and a higher standard of living. Granting them land in the former fiefdoms of the tsarists which will now be owned by the finns who died for it."
 FIN_finnic_energy_desc:0 "In the blood of every patriotic, God-fearing Finn, there is a spirit that animates him. A spirit that allows him to survive, allows him to fight and persevere where others might flee or shirk - the spirit of Sisu. It is our Sisu that allowed us to survive the reign of terror unleashed on Finland by the Russians; that allowed us to defeat the treacherous communists; that allows our formidable race to survive in these cold, harsh, yet caring lands. Our tenacity and perseverance - our Sisu - must be cultivated to protect the future generations of Finns. Young men and young women must know what their parents and grandparents have passed down to them, more than just their houses and valuables; they have given to them, through their virtuous genetics, a spirit of undying strength and will."
 FIN_the_forest_hunters_desc:0 "Jaegers are our lifeblood, the blood that runs through the veins of our armed forces. The spade that digs through the endless flood of snow and the last thing our enemies never see. They had proved their worth against anyone and anything that used to stand in our way. They killed Russians when it was necessary to kill Russians, and they buried thousands of Communists in the cold snow when it was necessary to kill Communists. Our Päällilkko used to be one of them, back when he took it from the frontlines like the grunts from below. If Finland is to survive, it needs more men like the Päällilkko. It needs blood and it needs honour—a loyal cadre of patriots fully aware that it is THEM who are guarding this country. They will live for no other reason than that Finland demands they live…and they will die when Finland demands they die."
 FIN_the_paallikkos_youngest_followers_desc:0 "Twice has Finland fallen into civil war in less than 20 years, twice has innocent blood been spilled because of socialist dogma corrupting the people, especially the youth. Easily moulded, indoctrinated and transformed into vile dissidents by compelling forces and lies of \"Utopia\". This cannot continue, and the solution is to rally the youth to the Päällilkko's side.\n\nA wing for the youth will protect the children of Finland, and show them the traditional values that can  bring the nation towards the future. Faith, Family and Fatherland will be the keys to the gate of a healthy nation for generations to come."
 FIN_a_northern_idyll_desc:0 "Though we are not reactionaries to outright despise the notion of industry, we must not fall into the dogmatic lies of the futurists. The land is the people, one made to serve and provide for the other. Such it was for the ancient Finns, for the Karelians, and for the Tavastians, who had braved the princes of Novgorod in centuries past, long before they came together to embody one people and one nation. They lived and loved off the fruits of this harsh land, taming it in furs back when the highest point of military culture was denoted by the bow and arrow. Yet what separated them from the Asiatics, the Mongoloid underbelly of Scandinavia, was a simple sentiment: a love for the soil itself.\n\nTo be Finnish nationalists, we have to admire those who sow and reap the fruit of this fine land. They alone bear the harsh upper layer of its nature, peel it off much like one would a shell around frozen fruit, and reap its rewards. The noble farmer had given us his utmost support, driving the Bolshevik out of the countryside and into the urban metropolis. Should we, therefore, not do everything in our power to accommodate his needs?"
 FIN_long_live_talvela_desc:0 "Me, you, our compatriots—we all stand at the edge of destiny. The rotten weeds inside the garden that calls itself Finland had been all but destroyed, too shattered to stand against the inevitable march of fate. Fires burn bright in Lapua, in Helsinki, in Turku, in Tempere…anywhere where the Finn toils and slumbers. Fires that, for once in history, are not fanned by any foreign power. Finland is united and victorious, no longer robbed off its potential by the cosmopolitan sodomite or the wretched smiles of the Kakistocratic few. Soon, Karelia will join us. And our Nordic friends too. We will assert ourselves onto the world, not as subjects to a Suzerain but as Kings and Queens, as patriots, lovers... Finns. It shall be nothing but glorious, this future that we all have to bear, yet one man bears the most of us all: General Paavo Talvela. The Finnish people compel you to stay with us a little while longer. For as much as you deserve your well-earned rest, the cause of freedom and love is far from done with this cursed world."

As he ascends the wintery landscape into the Heavens, where the Father and the Son and the Ghost await him with loving eyes, a second figure suffers beneath his feet. A poor man writhes in pain in the snow, his head bloodied and bright red. The mitre he grasps on has wholly scalped him in a gruesome divine punishment. The eternal repetition of the struggle between Bishop Henry and the peasant Lalli; the struggle between the mercurial Fennoman and the jovial Swede, the aristocracy and the rabble, the faithful and the pagan, the civilized and the barbaric. The two halves of Finland which cannot exist without one another, sealed within the binding of spilled blood.\n\nThe king points to the heavens with one hand and to the enemy with a sword in the other. He is clad in armour, his beard blonde, his hair flowing, his crown golden, his cape purple. Warriors pour from the forest, spears and bows menacing, preparing for the wholesale massacre of Finnish pagans still dressed in animal furs and wearing skull helmets. The Crusade of Finland, led by King Saint Erik of Sweden, was the beginning of the former nation. The scene presented its elevation from the status of idol-worshipping Baltic raiders into full members of Europe's Medieval sphere through Christianization and feudalization, the blessing of the land through a war of conquest by Throne and Altar. The Finland that was and will always be.\n\nThe images break and split, multiplying eternally, the colours glowing, the shapes becoming more defined, the black lines creating intricate silhouettes. Through them light penetrates the church's nave. From darkness emerge columns and capitals decorated with armoured knights under the timid gloom of wax candles.\n\nBeneath the arches, beneath the candles, kissed by the Northern sun filtered by the stained glass, a square-jawed Saint George. A long-haired Saint Louis. Saint Michael trampling a demon. Saint James holding a moor's head. Saint Maurice with an aquila. Saint Martin, Saint Sebastian, Saint Justinian. Cruel martyrdoms and stoic warriors, the image of a lost and grandiose spirituality now treasured by the newly built Church of Saint Henry and Saint Erik. It was the stoney incarnation of a new regime, of a new spirituality. Its consecration was about to begin.\n\nMen in black suits marched into the  gloomy temple, filling it like a sea of ink. The King followed suit, escorted by squires presenting the standards of the House of Lippe and the Kingdom of Finland, and he sat atop a gilded throne beneath the window of Saint Erik. Lord Ornulf came after, and his entourage showed the emblem of the House of Tigerstedt and his personal standard of a rampant wolf. He sat to the King's left, beneath Saint Henry and Lalli. The Archbishop of Turku took his place as the last of the trinity between the two. The priest rose his arms, and surrounded by blessed violence and holy warriors, spoke."

She licked her index, turned over the page, and continued:\n\n“Revolutionary ingrates still occupy blocks of our cities, their supposedly secret societies still dedicate themselves to reversing our mission, and what are we doing about it? Nothing! An army man- nay, an army boy was maimed and executed outside this very building just days ago, and we claim our reversal to be complete?”\n\nEvery word she spoke was felt deep in one’s soul, her piercing gaze could sow doubt even in the most ardent revolutionary.

The wooden podium on which Hilja stood creaked, and that was exactly when Kaarlo took his chance to speak.\n\n“As you might well be aware, there have been some difficulties in accruing enough manpower to fully occupy the cities; soldiers need salaries, they need food, equipment… weaponry!

Third try. “Patriotic Finns, heed the call!” Good but dry. Almost comparable to Talvela’s state press. “Arise, Finla—” generic, tired, stupid, stupid, stupid! The young man put down his pen in frustration. He had looked over to the bookworm, now asleep at the typewriter. Those two made up an important portion of the National Patriotic League of New Finland, which counted five members in total. Its banner, painted in blue and white colours, a painting of a sword piercing an elk’s skull in its centre, hung above them. When Talvela offered the standardisation of all political life towards accommodating the state, they arose, vowing to return colour to the lives of their countrymen.\n\nThe issue? The flag was practically the only thing the band of friends could agree on. Deciding on anything else involved lengthy and tense arguments, often provoking insults and fistfights in an otherwise brotherly atmosphere. Even the name opened its own can of issues. The student’s original idea was the Young Finland Party, to which the bookworm rose in opposition. After all, tying your image to that of a Russian party was a faux pas, even if it could have potentially landed them funding once they had more members. “Then call it the New Finland Patriotic Party,” said the young man almost emotionlessly. “People like new things. Implies a fresh look on things.\" This suggestion was not well received by the priest, who found the name dry and focused on all the wrong things. The National Christian Patriotic League of New Finland was his idea, but the soldier coerced him to drop the Christian part. They were no dry, joyless Puritans like the government, after all. So they had that. Then came the party newspaper name, which led to a particularly nasty spat between the student and the soldier, culminating in the latter vowing to leave the group altogether. They had not written him out from the member list altogether, though, as the bookworm insisted on his steady return in about a week.\n\nThe young man flipped a switch, turning the light off and letting his friend sleep in peace. From the manifesto they were supposed to write, they had not printed out a single word. They could not even agree on whether they should be syndicalists, as that was the economy of the future, or national capitalists, in the vein of the venerable Iron Guard in Romania. A good economy is moral, the priest often insisted, and the student vehemently disagreed. They had dreamed of a New Finland, yet none of them shared a view of what that dream would actually entail. He sighed, cleaning dust off the flag with his palm. One day, his homeland would live, free of reactionaries and communists. Not today, though. Today he was going to get ten whole hours of sleep."

 fin.19.desc:0 "Paavo Talvela was finding himself increasingly ill at ease in the Presidential Palace at night.  When the languid moonlight reached a boiling pitch through the rectangular skylights of the central hall, where Talvela would spend his nights pacing up and down, focusing himself wholly on the unending task of alleviating all the burdens which weighed so heavily on his fatherland.  This he would do alone, dismissing his bodyguards despite their protestations, certain that a man of his caliber, who had assumed such titanic responsibilities, must stare down those responsibilities in solitude.  He had his sidearm with him, of course, although it wasn’t until recently, when he began to detect, in the furthest corners of his eye, shadows glimmering against the wall and cast by nothing, or an unnatural creaking in the walls, that he began to find his hand drifting towards his holster.\n\nWhen the tide of Lutheranism first swept across this savage Tundra, Talvela recalled, it cast its righteous eye first on the witches, the unholy practitioners of things unseen.  Could that be it?  Was he bewitched?  Hunted by some baneful familiar?  No, impossible, he was a man of God - not foolish superstitions.  Still… Something was there with him while he was alone.  In the nights going forward he would try to capture it fully with his gaze, spinning himself around to meet the shadows as they skittered away into the icy moonlight.  One night, as he was approaching the end of the long hallway he heard the faintest jittering emanating from one of the many portraits of Finland’s greatest heroes he had lined the walls with.  The one commanding his attention at the moment was a portrait of Paavo Ruotsailanen, done sometime in the Eighteenth Century in brooding oils.  Staring at it, Talvela could feel that he had established some sort of sensory beach-head upon wherever these shadows were coming from.  The paintings undoubtedly stood at the locus of whatever was going on around him.\n\nThe next night, Talvela halted his pacing before the grand portrait of Michael Agricola.  Closing his eyes, he could feel the shadows coalescing on the canvas, resolving into the great circles - no, they must be eyes - gazing at him.  Witches may be trinkets of a superstitious mind, by Talvela had seen too much death to discount the possibility of ghosts.  And here they must be, the ghosts of Finland’s past standing watch over him, investing their long lost hopes of a free Finland in him from beyond the grave.  Talevela opens his eyes, and kneels before the row of paintings."
