The hungry double-headed eagle in the West tears itself apart for now, but how long can it take until Kolchak will gather his armies and order them to crush the last bastion of liberty in Russia? This worry is omnipresent in the politics of Zheltorossiya, giving way to various radicals, promising a revolutionary revival and the destruction of the Empire once and for all. For these fears, the democratic government had to loosen their principles and institute an army service for all citizens, along with arms stockpiled in every town. When they will come they'll meet our every man and woman armed to the teeth, ready to strike back at their oppressors."

 ZHR_railway_crash_desc:0 "The dependence of the Zheltorossiyan economy on Japan paid its due, in a way more catastrophic than anyone could expect. Civil war raging in the Land of the Rising Sun, the mighty Zaibatsu fell down like cardboard towers. The consequences for Zheltorossiya, for the worse, experiencing an ill harvest this year, were disasterous - the supply lines became paralysed overnight, thousands lost their jobs, trade became impossible, factories stopped working. The prices of basic utilities rose to the skies, the people, demanding bread came to the streets, a wave of protests submerging the state. General strike was declared, pressing radical leftist demands against the government (with no doubt, a merit of the ambitious and inteligent organiser - Aleksei Gastev).\n\nYet in this chaos, the more far-sighted individuals, some would say cynical, see an opportunity. The fist of Japanese influence being broken, the reign of the corrupt government may come to an end, opening a new, brighter chapter in Zheltorossiyan history."

With the blessing of the new government, the Red Guards, under the command of Leon Trotsky and Aleksei Gastev stormed the parliament, declaring a hastily written manifesto announcing the liquidation of the bourgeiosie Supreme Soviet and submission of all the power into the hands of the People's Revolutionary Comittee, its most prominent members being Aleksandr Bogdanov, Maria Spidironova and Gastev himself. The Comittee has to reign absolute power until \"stability is restored and new state of affairs based on the principle of socialist democracy is estabilished\". This unstable rule meets resistance from the nation's nascent capitalists, some worrying a total dissolution of the Republic is to come - or worse, that the \"people's fist against reaction\" will turn into an apparatus of new totalitarian tyranny."

His theories were made almost half a century ago and times have obviously changed; and no other theory has aged as poorly as his stageism.\n\nFor decades we allowed the party's of the proletariat to slavishly wait for the bourgeoisie to politically elevate Russia into conditions amicable to proletarian revolution. They have failed; something went wrong in our theory and a slavish devotion to the letter of Marx betrays his spirit.\n\nWe can no longer wait for the bourgeoisie to create the revolution.We will keep all wealth seized in the revolution and not reconstitute the bourgeoisie as a class. The party, the state apparatus, and the army will bring Russia from feudalism directly into socialism, even if it has to do so kicking and screaming.

Vasily Chapayev, the People's Marshal, has ultimately prevailed over the vile parasites which wished to haunt our beloved Zheltorossiya. His first act: a complete abolition of the Republic and the state as a whole, and a restoration of power back to the people. May anarchy and freedom rule over bourgeois vileness! May the masses reign forevermore!"

So, of course, the supposedly educated men have declared that it was a fanciful policy. But who cares about them? What is ours was taken, and once taken back, shall be ours again.

Reports of troop buildups in Yakutia, the perennial concern over Japanese encroachment into the economy which has only gotten worse, and now Tokyo has decided it needs to terrorize China.

Sure, Zheltorossiya had its own superstitions in the form of socialism, but this was a much more tame evil compared to the horrors that laid west. \n\nShe thought how her life would have gone if the civil war never took place.

But what to do?\n\nBogdanov had been so focused on getting everyone together to topple Kerensky that he put off the post-coup strategy to the 11th hour, which let him whittle his options down to two. As provisional leader, neither was his pure ideal; yet this was not a time for pure idealism. The fate of Russian socialism lay in his hands, and Bogdanov had to decide if it would live or die.\n\nThe first was the safer option; simply implement all demands as listed, only letting socialists run, and attempt to reconcile with some of the less bourgeois elements of the Kerenskite Republic. Of course, this had the obvious downside of giving the moderates an advantage — as well as upsetting those to his left — but it might be the only thing that could keep the republic together.\n\nThe second option was riskier. It would be to carry the revolution forward and attack the state as is, to overthrow the existing institutions and relations without regard to precedent. If he played his cards right, then he could use this upheaval to permanently enforce his control. Yet such chaos could play into other factions' hands, let alone the risk it could do to the stability of the republic.\n\nWhether to strike while the iron is hot or to thoroughly cook out rot. What to do with this furnace he'd been given. Bogdanov had a long moment of contemplation, the grandfather clock ticking in the background. With a single choice, he would either secure his future, or guarantee his downfall. Yet he had to act; the time for pondering had passed."

It seemed decentralized and networked, an outside power would need too many connections. The attack was definitely coming from within the house, and he could find fault in everyone.\n\nHe quickly ruled out an upstart Vperedist, as it was not just him being attacked but the entire wing. Menshevism was the standard go-to, but it would be confusing why they of all people would attack him on establishmentism.\n\nThe OLN was the obvious next choice, but it was an odd line. In the event of his fall, the forces did not point towards them gaining any power. Mensheviks would probably take over the party and rally the actual establishment to reestablish order— unless they had an outside assistant.\n\nChapayev had made no secret of his sympathies to the movement.

Normally this would not be a concern for us, but this election holds the distinction of being the only free and fair election in the Russian world outside Harbin. So, I think we should celebrate our comrades who bravely stand for liberation in the face of Tsarist oppression! Thank you, comrades.\"\n\nAleksei Gastev sat down with a smirk on his face, already having incited a riot in the Supreme Soviet. On the right, Kadets shouted down his overture to Kavkaz on the grounds that calling their elections \"free and fair\" is a farce. On the left, Bolsheviks applauded him for exposing those in the congress who couldn't stand for republican unity.\n\nChaos in the congress was not uncommon but usually it calmed down within a minute or two. However, the boos and applause only seemed to be increasing with time as more and more members took a stance one way or another on the Kavkaz Question. One group that stayed quiet through all the fights were the Trudoviks who seemed to mostly be waiting for their leader, Kerensky, to make a decision on which side to come down on.\n\nOn the one hand, Kavkaz was obviously not democratic, and they barely even pretend to be. On the other hand, it also had quite a few fans in Zheltorossiya for being a constant thorn in the side of Tsarists in the west, despite some strange stories coming out of Tiflis. Kerensky had tried to avoid taking a stance but only his bloc had the power to shut down the riot by siding with one side or the other. He had to make a decision:"

The Japanese Ambassador had a look in his eyes that would feel more appropriate on the face of a murderer about to dismember his victim. His voice was curt and condescending but there was an underlying hatred as well. Kerensky sat, preparing for more of an interrogation than a meeting.\n\n\"Can you explain to me why you issued a \"declaration of sympathy\" for China?\"\n\n\"Well, the declaration doesn't mention any wrongdoing on the part of Japan, only sympathy for the plight that Chi-\"\n\n\"Do not play dumb with me.

Now with this declaration, you make our sphere look weak and fractured, which we cannot afford right now.\"\n\nKerensky was dumbfounded. Putting aside how brazen the ambassador was about a possible coup, this was not confident language. He began thinking what that could mean and nothing good seemed to come from it. After a pause, he asked a question:\n\n\"How bad is it?\"\n\n\"Very very bad, Kerensky. The generals did not plan this properly and the public at home seems on the verge of revolt. So what do you think it will do for morale to hear our supposed ally talk of \"sympathy\" for China? Even if we censor the declaration, it will seep in through cracks.\"\n\nIt felt like a bomb had gone off directly next to him. Not only was revolution on the table but something as toothless and meaningless as his declaration is being seen as a catalyst. How close was it then? And more importantly, how could Zheltorossiya survive its biggest ally and economic overlord falling into civil war.\n\nIt couldn't.\n\nFor all his initial bluster, the ambassador now seemed more defeated than anything. 사내가 남긴 한 마디를 끝으로 대화는 끝이 났습니다."

Myatokin seemed to be swinging from manic to depressive by the syllable.\n\n\"I cannot explain to you why, but Kerensky tells me that in the coming months there might be some problems in Zheltorossiya.

What kind of problems could lead to revolution in the near future? Why would it hurt the Trudoviks enough to need to rely on two minor parties for support? While these were important questions to both men, it also screamed opportunity.\n\nBoth the Mensheviks and PSR were opposition parties who had never had much influence in the Supreme Soviet.

The moonlit windows cast a lovely view of the Harbin cityscape, a sight which went unnoticed to the candlelit coupist. For the last week, he had been pouring over every record he could find, engrossed completely in what was dawning on him. Every document that he read, every statement of finance, every trade report, they all pointed towards one blindingly obvious fact: the Republic was owned by the Japanese.\n\nWhile it was obvious Kerensky had become a puppet, it was only now becoming clear that the bourgeoisie, bureaucracy, businesses, and even the banks all had answered to the Japanese Empire in one way or another. The scent of burning wax filled Trotsky's nostrils as his fingers flipped through figures over and over, unable to comprehend how he missed this. Everyone knew the Japanese had a grip on Zheltorossiya; nobody knew it was a stranglehold.\n\nAs the sun began to shine through the smokestacks, the truth of the matter dawned on him. The Japanese had a tentacle in nearly everything; everything but one. The last institution that was free from foreign imperialism was the army. The Japanese had sold their guns and financed their rearmament, but somehow they had never been able to take root. A tired Trotsky rubbed his eyes, his brain frantically calculating how or why the army had been spared.\n\nUnless... perhaps they were simply more organized. Better kept. Of a better class. The Japanese would have every incentive to control the army; yet they failed. The only answer to Trotsky's question was that the virtue of the army, no, the very proletarian nature of the soldiers, was the only force that withstood the siren song of imperialism. Trotsky let out a weary smile, blessed with the truth from the fruit of knowledge. He had found the saviors of Russia."

But the perception of Trotsky as camera shy might lead the populace to believe that Chapayev was the true helmsman, and while he was no enemy, he was certainly not the most politically reliable speaker. To reaffirm his firm control over the situation, he would need to get out of his office and into the streets and fields; he would start where Chapayev had his strongest base.\n\n\"The necrotic and miserable pseudo-republic which had immiserated our people is over. It is dust, ash, smashed to atoms. With its death, a new red republic can spring forth and lead us to a bright future. A republic controlled for and by working people, in which no noble or capitalist can steal the bread of peasants or workers!\"\n\nIt was a somewhat trite speech but there were more important matters than crafting a perfectly poetic moment; that was for men like Mayakovsky. While it wasn't his best speech, he still expected a bit more excitement from the crowd. But he could see what was wrong on their faces. It had been what was wrong in the previous village and what will likely be wrong in the next.\n\nHunger. Hopelessness. Exhaustion. While no one was against him, no one was really for him either; they seemed to lack the energy to have an opinion at all. Every peasant he talked to seemed to lack any vision for the future and just talked of bread; and while the revolution would deliver that, they seemed skeptical; everyone promised bread afterall. The finer details seemed to not even be communicable; he realized too late that very few people would know what an atom was.\n\nEveryone felt tired, ready to give up. Everyone except the soldiers which surrounded him. They seemed ecstatic, their thunderous applause drowning out their growling stomachs. He could tell that any energy the crowd had came not from themselves or his words, but the brimming grins and spirited cheers of the soldiers.

The genius of the working class would seep into every layer of the state and the revolution would gain its desperately needed revitalization.\n\nThe first volley hit. Reasonable requests about allocations to local soviets, and initially courteous disagreements about who should get what. Obviously Trotsky expected this, in fact it would be necessary to understand where the issues were if proletarian genius could hammer them out. Yet, the solutions never came, only more intense fighting.\n\nHe tried to stay elevated and beyond the proceedings. Yes he certainly had his thoughts and opinions but the voice of the proletariat should be respected no matter how raucous.

The bar which drowned his miseries had been hollowed out and was being turned into some \"Center for Cultural Enrichment\" – an utterly unsuitable replacement.\n\nBefore going home to spend another night coping without an ounce of relief, he decided a risk needed to be taken. He inquired with a well-connected coworker if he knew of any illicit sources of his sweet nectar. The risk did not bear fruit; his coworker, Kolya Vasiliev, an apparent true believer, gave him a firm scolding for trying to circumvent the ban.\n\nFor a moment Artur had a sinking feeling he would be reported, or worse, subjected to a lecture about the virtues of Lev the Great, it appeared that Kolya had taken pity on his condition, inviting him to a show instead. Artur had no interest in theater and, at this point, just wanted to sleep off his withdrawal. However, he did not want to let Kolya down or get into his bad graces. Thus he agreed to go.\n\nAfter their shift ended, Kolya took Artur out for an early dinner before heading to the theater at 8PM. The show was Barbarians by Maxim Gorky; while he had never heard of the play, he had heard of Gorky, although he couldn't really remember anything specific about him. He settled into his seat, let out a sigh, and prepared to bear some pretentious nonsense.\n\nBut instead, Artur found himself gripped by the performance. It started a bit slow, sure, but as the play went on, he found himself more and more enraged at Cherkun and Tsyganov, the engineers sent to \"civilize\" the provincial town who only brought degradation under the banner of progress. About three-quarters of the way through the play, he realized why he hated the two so much: they were Trotsky. Under the twisted sigil of civilization, they robbed the locals of their way of life and brought nothing but pain. When the performance ended, Kolya turned to Artur, smiling through the dark.\n\n\"So, what did you think? Better than spending a night in the bar, huh?\"\n\nArtur thought for a moment. His fear of being reported resurfaced, mixing with the rage he felt at the bastard engineers - his soul almost leapt out of his throat. Yet instead, his mouth contorted back into a smile, one to match Kolya's face, a mask to keep his retorts positive. Artur had enjoyed the play, but not for the reasons Kolya had hoped for.

Sticky bands of sanguine vitality clung to the wooden stock as a red-leathered soldier turned his rifle around, shouting for the ashen man to identify himself. In return, Artur spat a mouthful of newly-loose teeth at the barbarian before garbling out a protest.\n\n\"The Soviet will fucking hang you.\"\n\nArtur scrambled for his pistol before noticing his arm go limp. He saw the flash and heard the bullet far before he felt the shock of the bullet ripping through his flesh, rending his muscle, shattering his bone. With a clamor, Artur was disarmed, and as the man in the red leather trenchcoat snapped the bolt of his rifle back and ejected the spent cartridge, his face was plastered with a smile that gently let loose a soft whisper of victory.\n\n\"Who do you think approved this?\""

He had let idealism and sentimentality blind him to the obvious fact, that the crisis around Kerensky was not caused by him or an incompetent upper class: it had been caused by everyone. He should have known from the beginning, but his faith in the people blinded him; he would not make this error again.\n\nTrotsky steadied himself, then walked up to the podium, surrounded by guardsmen in case things got heated. He looked over the Supreme Soviet. How many would turn on him with saccharine words and a basic application of pressure? Nakhodka was a small town, and yet a million whispers of treason sprung out of the Supreme Soviet from that alone. What if some agitators in Vladivostok had rebelled instead? Would their Soviet be just as ready to rebel? There was no reason to think they would not have.\n\n\"In light of the events in Nakhodka, it has become clear the poisonous roots of foreign espionage and sabotage are still omnipresent in our republic. Until all these are rooted out firmly, we cannot trust democratic institutions to give free and fair results that are not corrupted, as was seen by the treasonous actions by the Nakhodka Soviet. Thus, until the situation is resolved, the Supreme Soviet shall be dissolved and the Red Army will take temporary emerg-\"\n\nHe did not get halfway through his speech before the floor became cacophonous—expected, all too expected. He would let them get their protests out now. This seizure was no delicate surgical maneuver. It didn't have to be. Despite his official line, the issue was not that they were foreign spies – the issue was that they were weak. So very weak, like little kittens. Their weakness was their treason, yet all they could do was mewl. Mewl, and mewl, and mewl. Too loud. A quick gesture at his guards and the congress was over. That shut them up – cowards to the core.\n\nTrotsky exited the stage, thinking about what the international press would say. Obviously the domestic press would be controlled, but he knew the capitalists of the world would lap this up. \"A Red Bonaparte in Harbin\", \"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Lev Trotsky\", and so on. Every concern, all the hand-wringing over a supposed coup confirmed. Yet he was not bothered. Let them call him what they want. If he was to be a Bonaparte..."
