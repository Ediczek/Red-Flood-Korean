His continued tenure as the military governor is the reward for his loyalty to the empire. Following the civil war, his rule has been characterised by repression of the native Balts, as well as advocating strongly for Russian support of the German Empire in Prussia."
 WRU_making_gains_desc:0 "The Baltic economy is in orbit of the major cities nearby, chiefly Petrograd and Gelsingfors. Food, fabrics, materials all destined for the ports and sailing the Baltic."
 WRU_reward_army_loyalty_desc:0 "The Western Army has maintained its place as a reliable force protecting Russia. While other governors contend with ambitious and traitorous officers, the army headquarters in Riga is orderly. Such loyalty must be maintained with proper incentives."
 WRU_russification_desc:0 "The Baltics are sparsely populated and rich in potential. Russian aristocrats and socially mobile middle class workers are encouraged to settle in the countryside and continue to cement the Baltics as a fully Russian region."
 WRU_reward_freikorps_desc:0 "The Baltic-German Freikorps comprise a significant part of the military structure in the Baltic. Their work strengthens the Governorate every day. While quiet doubts remain about their loyalty to Russia itself, their loyalty to Avalov seems sure."
 WRU_encourage_settlement_desc:0 "Active campaigns to increase the number of Russians moving into the Baltics have begun. Some thousands have demonstrated interest, with purchases, provisions and relocations being made in anticipation of their arrival."
 WRU_cultural_societies_desc:0 "Developing the Russian cultural footprint in the Baltics must continue and expand. The language will find a home in schools around the region, it's philosophy will be mused on in social clubs in Riga, the cuisine will find patrons on the streets of Revel and the memory of a Baltics without Russians will slowly fade."
 WRU_army_with_the_state_desc:0 "In the vein of Prussian militarism, the Baltics operates as a state serving an army. The Western Army is the first priority of all major decisions made, it is the main benefactor of the domestic economy and industry."

Ever since the end of the Great War, the docks saw significantly less traffic with merchants prefering to bring their goods through the much cheaper ports in Prussia or straight to Petrograd. It made the job of the local customs department significantly easy, but it also made the dock prime target. A note, unsigned, printed in broken Russian, was found attached to a suspiciously unlabeled crate, and it read:\n\n\"Soon: the worker's revolution. Prepare: your whole rotten structure shall collapse!\""

Loaded down with well made and pricey possessions, the vehicles each pulled into large manors overlooking the fields and farms. Landlords. Foreign landlords, coming on behalf of the Russian government. They were healthy, jovial people, eyes glittering, dressed in fine clothing and carrying the like of gold pocket watches. They smoked better tobacco, and drank the finest alcohols, imports from Britain.\nNew lives in new lands, plenty of opportunities for profit, and the total blessing of their own government to do it. It was no surprise, really that so many wealthy Russians headed west. Bit by bit, little by little, these laughing, good looking people owned all the farmland anyone could see. As the cars and trucks moved past, children pointed out of the windows of these fashionable vehicles at the beautiful landscapes and rolling fields, and even more at the poor and dispossessed locals that could be found labouring on both sides of the roads. Hunched, tired figures, overcast like the skies overhead.\nThe children of these families didn't notice the sullen glares boring through the windows of their cars, but the adults must have been able to, if they bothered to look."

The night was cool, a gentle breeze blew in through the open window, and yet, the weight of his sheets felt stifling. He hid in them, nevertheless. The footsteps were back. They paced beneath his window, subtle, but all too real. Nikolai clenched his eyes shut. The third night in a row, the unseen visitor stalked back and forth through the garden, each footfall heavy and hateful.\nWorse, Nikolai's father refused to believe him. Ivan Mikhailovich Seremov had rolled his eyes, dismissing his child's fears as nerves in a new and alien country. Nikolai knew better. He knew those feet outside his window were not an animal's, or the product of his imagination. Outside, someone coughed. Nikolai hoped his father heard it.\n But nothing happened.\nAcross the room, Tatyana's soft breathing was the only other sound in the room.\nNikolai considered getting out of bed and calling father again. He froze as the front door opened. The creaking hinges, so familiar by day, were alien and hostile by night, foreboding and menacing. They groaned, long, loud. Someone heard this. Finally, someone knew he wasn't lying. The maid was up. He heard her, next door, muttering something to herself. Her feet were not sure in the dark as she blearily found her way to her door and opened it. Nikolai held his breath as the plump woman padded down the stairs.\nHe nearly choked in fear as she screamed. It was a drawn out, blood curdling thing, filled with terror and pain. It wavered and warbled between the wet sounds of impact. With a sickening thud, the maid's voice died in her throat. Tatyana was awake now, already sobbing quietly. There was a brief pause before a pair of boots began to thump towards the stairs. Nikolai was almost frozen in fear, but forced himself out of bed as he heard his father's door slam open. Just two days ago, Ivan had told him to be a man.\nHe opened his door as his father came storming down the hall, his old officer's sabre clenched in one fist. Ivan's tired blue eyes locked onto Nikolai's own.\n\"Go back to your room,\" he said, storming past, \"Protect your sister.\"\nNikolai retreated. Tatyana was sitting bolt upright in bed, tears shining against the blue-white half light of the moon outside.\nIvan yelled something at the unseen force advancing up the stairs. Then, he too began to scream. This wasn't piercing, and though it was agonized, it wasn't nearly as frightened as the maids' had been. A man snarled, voice hate filled and wordless. Nikolai heard another pair of feet rush from his parents' bedroom and towards his."

No screams now, only a thud, and the sound of something wet and fleshy, like the sound meat makes in a butcher's shop. Nikolai squeezed his eyes shut, shielding his trembling sister behind him, facing the door, hoping against hope that the presence on the other side was not the unknown visitor. That somehow, his father had won the fight in the end.\nThe handle turned.\nNikolai opened his eyes, forcing himself to witness whatever it was that stood before him. It was all he could do not to tremble. He was rooted to the spot. The man was dressed in black, face shrouded by a hood. His eyes glinted, cool and hard in the moonlight. At his feet, the ruin of Nikolai's mother, head staved in. Her blood shone, crimson and chunky with flesh.\nTatyana wailed.\nNikolai tried to remain brave for his sister. He tried to be a man, to honour the military heritage of his family.\n\"It is important,\" Ivan's voice echoed in his head, \"For a man to die with dignity.\"\nStill, he flinched as the axe came up, shining and wicked, trailing flecks of castoff."

He hated the endless manual labour, the silent fear that dominated the fields that he and his colleagues worked in. But above all, he hated the German aristocrats that had all but forced him to do this. They didn't need to put guns on him. They controlled the food, the markets, the money, everything. There was no other work, not for an Estonian. Andrus was either a slave in all but name, or he'd starve to death.\nHe glared at the overseer watching them. Far from the stereotypical view of a slavemaster, the Baron was not an angry or cruel looking man. Rather, he was rosy cheeked and jolly. Quick to laughter, the Baron did not seem at all the kind of person that would hopelessly sweat men for nothing. But as the Baron looked back and forth over the workers below him, Andrus knew the truth. The smile on the baron's face went no further than his lips.\nThe man next to him grunted as he fell, legs unable to support him. They were barely paid anything, and they had to pay for room and board on top of it. Andrus knew that he and the rest were slowly dying. He glanced back up at the Baron. Cold eyes locked onto his, shadowed beneath the overcast sky. The Baron glanced at the fallen man next to Andrus. He pointed to the prostrate form, head turning to the guard standing next to him, pristinely uniformed in pipe grey. The soldier, hands folded neatly behind his back, simply nodded.\nThe Baron turned and waddled away.\nThe next day, the man next to Andrus was gone.\nAndrus toiled on. He just wanted one good meal."

The Russian artillery, along with gunboats from the remnants of the local Baltic Fleet squadron on station, leveled entire neighborhoods to break Estonian concentrations and allow the infantry to maneuver and envelope the areas still under Partisan control.Mopping-up operations are ongoing, and while some Estonian groups have managed to exfiltrate from the city, but by nightfall a majority of the survivors had surrendered to the Russian regulars (who are at least in theory subject to some legal restraint) rather than risk the dubious mercy of the monarchist irregulars.
