TRK_DESC_MENU:0 "The Governorate-General of Turkestan has no qualities with which it could be described. The Civil War led to rebellions that were assigned to Boris Annenkov and his division to deal with. Their unseen cruelty came upon the territories he was granted, but he never got around to complete the mission. Instead, every year he demands funds to cover the expenses he claims necessary to mount an expedition into the rebellious regions, and every year, they are granted. However, these money are spent to found the savage raids of Annenkov and his band in the neighbouring regions and sometimes even in his own land."

The Governor-General rules his land as a fierce Khan, his crimson-stained saber sparking the stone as it cuts down all who stick their heads up.\n\nYet there are those who justify this brutality, pointing to the palaces built in Verniy atop the backs of "churka" laborers.

TRK_realm_of_seven_rivers_desc:0 "It is no great secret that our Governorate-General is in a precarious and unenviable position. No other governorate or region within Kolchak's fractured web attempting to bind the warlords of the Russian Empire together, even comes close to the conditions present in Russian Turkestan. Crippling poverty, near-total absence of a standard economy, abject misery and ever-present paranoia at the possibility of a raiding party of our forces drawing near. That's how the churkas live at least; we soldiers of the Seven Rivers Army live like kings, wanting for nothing! Though we are nominally a provisional military dictatorship beholden to the central government in Petrograd, in reality we are better described as bandits with a country. Nowhere within our borders is beyond the hawkish eye of our great Ataman, Boris Vladimirovich Annenkov. For nigh on two decades uninterrupted, Annenkov and his motley army of Siberian Cossacks, bandits and other undesirables have bled the 튀르케스탄s dry via extortion, raids, massacres and everything in between. We have no intention of stopping, though we refer to our activities as \"peacekeeping operations\" for the sake of appearances and watchful eyes from the capital. As a consequence of our brutality though, our land is frozen in time and arguably regressing in many ways, any development is either impossible or in the case of the cities, glacial in pace. For Annenkov however, this state of affairs is quite satisfactory, at least for now. The Turkestan Governorate-General is the Ataman's fief, he and us want for nothing, be it booze, money, women, opium or any other craving that tickles their fancy. After all, the natives know what follows when they resist; excellent practice for the troops."
TRK_lawless_frontier:0 "The Lawless Frontier"
TRK_lawless_frontier_desc:0 "In the days of the Old Empire, before Kolchak and the Black Hundreds attempted in vain to prevent its complete dissolution or fall to the Red Armies, Turkestan used to have an almost hopeful quality to it. Prime and virgin land ready for development and integration into an industrial powerhouse. Such naive aspirations are currently as dead as the old Tsar. Though the Governorate is referred to internationally as the \"only remaining Russian controlled part of the region\", this slice of Turkestan in truth belongs to Annenkov and Annenkov alone. It is his personal fief, and he sees it as such too. Indeed, ours is a lawless frontier, where we are free to roam and ravage as we please. Well, within reason of course. Nobody wants to be tied to a stake and shot to pieces for the crime of aggravating Annenkov by causing too much of an uproar after all. This state of affairs came to be as a result of the 튀르케스탄 revolt and bid for independence during the chaos of the civil war, Kolchak having dispatched Annenkov to crush the rebellion who was at that time in command of the 1st and 4th Siberian Cossack regiments. These forces would eventually amalgamate into the basis of us, the Seven Rivers Army. Once the primary rebel groups opposing our initial invasion of the Northeastern portion of the region had been dealt with though, Annenkov refused to push onwards in a bloody meat grinder to recapture the remaining land under native control. Cunningly, Annenkov instead set about reaping as much profit and loot in the name of \"crushing rebels\" as he could physically pack into his baggage trains, proceeding to clamp down in the area already taken and no farther. This did much to add to the chagring and ire of Kolchak, who nonetheless was forced by circumstance to appoint our Ataman as \"General-Governor\". This leaves us in our present state almost two decades later, our raiders roaming like bloodhounds across the region searching for targets and treasure, wild and uninhibited. Despite this, we are a rump state and are all too keen to avoid eliciting too much anger from Kolchak, lest he spoil our hunting grounds."
TRK_rabid_dogs:0 "Its Rabid Dogs"
TRK_rabid_dogs_desc:0 "We are faced with a dilemma. Accustomed to acting with broad impunity, our bandit-soldiers of the Seven Rivers Army have an endless and demanding appetite for new targets to pillage, plunder and extort. This ravenous and frenzied exploitation of new areas means they are quickly exhausted of worthwhile victims for hunting. The result of this constant demand for better raiding targets is that affected settlements take a long while to recover and the Annenkovite raiding parties slowly but surely travel further and further afield in search of loot. Sometimes across the border to the Mother Country itself... \n\nIf it were to become widely known that soldiers that were, at least on paper, under the administration of Kolchak were looting and destroying Russian villages, the resulting scandal and crackdown could quite easily jeopardize all that Annenkov has strived for in building his own domain and following. Conversely though, Annenkov knows full well that to deny his soldiers the life they've become accustomed to is an equally dangerous game. His entire army might well fracture into different cliques and gangs if not kept satisfied, ending his Governorate overnight via vicious infighting like a pack of rabid hounds. As such, he keeps a steady hand on the activity of the raiding parties, making concessions like one might lift the lid on a kettle close to the boil. Most of them, he directs southwards and westwards towards the perfectly acceptable targets of the upstart 튀르케스탄 statelets or other neighbors. The few that do make the journey across the border to plunder outlying and remote Russian targets however... do so with strict instructions of covering their faces, removing any and all insignia, dressing in 튀르케스탄 attire and speaking as little Russian as possible around outsiders. Such an arrangement satisfies Annenkov and his men, the former retains his vice-like grip on power, whilst the latter reap greater yields from their butchery."
TRK_sinkhole:0 "Sinkhole in the Steppes"
TRK_sinkhole_desc:0 "It is a fortuitous position we find ourselves in! Though many cowards might describe this notion as fraudulent and malicious, as we exist in an official capacity as a General Governorate of the Russian Empire, we have some degree of access to the state coffers and are eligible to receive additional funding from the Kremlin if it is deemed appropriate. Let us make it appropriate! The inflation of present threats to our government, recharacterizing the villages we plunder as having contained 튀르케스탄 resistance safehouses, presenting rumors of a possible 튀르케스탄 unification lest we receive further support, to mention but a few strategies we might pursue. Kolchak is no fool though, and will likely (and rightfully) doubt the veracity of our claims. That is not why he will grant us our request, in truth he will grant it because he has no other choice. Annenkov is fully aware of the fragile and tense relations between Kolchak and his subordinate governors, and knows precisely how to leverage that tension. Kolchak knows full well that refusing to support us despite the supposed severity of our claims acts as the perfect excuse for the other warlords of Russia to make a push for further independence and autonomy from the central government. The possible geopolitical consequences of this are the chains that bind Kolchak's hands behind his back. If the price of preventing his precious balance of power from imploding is a few hefty sums of millions of rubles accompanied by additional arms shipments, then Kolchak will pay it. We know he will. This is a song and dance that has changed over the past twenty years, beginning with sincerity as Anennkov crushed the initial uprising in the crib, devolving into a charade that has proven an extremely lucrative form of income for Governorate year by year. The whole situation is a beautifully cynical critique of the state of the Empire. It's quite humorous, we pulled off this \"raid\" without having to shoot someone's relatives like we usually do."
TRK_horde_state:0 "A Horde with a State"
TRK_horde_state_desc:0 "It is hardly a secret that many see us as a mere pretence of government, set up primarily for the benefit of Annenkov and ourselves. They are correct. As things stand, it is plain for all to see that perhaps the only similarity we share with more \"civilised nations\" is that we have a monopoly on violence. Some foreign milksop zhid politicians must be wringing their hands at the prospect of the continued survival of \"savages\" like ourselves this far into the 20th century and their precious modern age. Yet we are here, and there is a very simple reason for that. People crave security, and often quite willingly suffer indignity if it can be provided. Our extortion and mistreatment of the 튀르케스탄s and others living within our lands is not entirely one-sided, in return for the monumental \"tariffs\", \"fees\" and every other means of seizing wealth that we employ, they are placed under our protection. These are our lands after all, the people living on them are just as much our property as everything else within our sphere of influence. They fear living under some of our neighbours just as much, if not more as they do living under us. We shall place a special emphasis on the protection rackets we enforce in order to consolidate obedience from the peasants, the shackles loosened just a tad. It's amazing what you can get a man to agree to when you have a rope around his neck."
TRK_leash_on_paper:0 "A Leash Only on Paper"
TRK_leash_on_paper_desc:0 "Out of all the Russian warlord states, ours is by far the one with the most tenuous and fragile bonds to Kolchak's government, thousands of miles away and located in a region considered a wind blasted wasteland by many. That's not even including the similarly destitute state of Turkestan as a whole. Between ourselves, the Republicans, Islamists, Socialists and the oil-mad British, this dark corner of the world might as well not exist in the minds of most politicians in Petrograd, if it weren't for the revenue they expect from us. All the better for us to thrive anyways, after all we are frankly the main cause of much devastation in the region and the last thing we want is a crackdown spoiling our slice of Central Asia. The Governorate-General of Turkestan has lasted for twenty years and under Annenkov's cunning leadership and our rifles it'll last many more. Though we are technically still subservient to the Russian military chain of command, let there be no mistake, we Cossacks of the Seven Rivers Army draw our sabres at the command of one man. His name is Annenkov, not Kolchak, something that the mewling pups in the capital would do well to remember. Not that they could ever do anything, we are far too remote and far flung to be worth the effort needed to bring us into line. So things will continue as they have done, the paper leashes around our necks remaining on as long as they need to."
TRK_pack_free:0 "The Pack Set Free"
TRK_pack_free_desc:0 "It's almost too good to be true, even we didn't believe it at first upon hearing the news. Russia is in civil war once more, Kolchak ousted from atop his eyrie in Petrograd at the hands of monarchist conspirators. Any semblance or pretence of control over the various Governorate-General and Military Districts has gone out of the window entirely. Annenkov has been lightning fast in his reaction to the situation, as the fires of war spread across Eurasia yet again. Declaring the Governorate's \"immediate full autonomy\" and a state of emergency \"until such a time as we know who rules the Empire\", which anyone with half a brain knows is never coming. At long last we are free to do as we please, without having to meekly pretend and defer to those incompetent bastards. In the midst of this new time of chaos we shall reap and plunder as never before. Our only limit now is how far we are willing to ride to find new territories to exploit. There has never been a better time to be an Annenkovite. The army grows restless, initial celebrations and drunken frolicking have subsided and been replaced with tension so thick you could cut it with a knife. They are restless, enamoured by the thought of the endless supply of fresh hunts. It would be remiss of us to deny them for much longer. Load your rifles, saddle the horses and sharpen your shaskas, comrades. We've an entire continent's worth of loot, wine and women to drag home just waiting for us out there. All we have to do now is decide where to strike first!"
TRK_treasure_cove:0 "Treasure Coves of the Steppes"
TRK_treasure_cove_desc:0 "Let our first target be our neighbours, the Governorate-General of Kazan. They're the ideal target for our newly freed ambitions. Unsuspecting, occupied with the current crisis affecting all of Russia and their own internal affairs. Of course, Annenkov has sanctioned raids into Kazan territory before but these have been minor affairs and brushed aside with insincere apologies and excuses. These new raids we plan to launch will be of several orders of magnitude larger. Dozens upon dozens of squadrons of Cossack cavalry reaving all across the Kazan borderlands, sowing chaos and discord. Constantly on the move to disrupt any attempt at a coordinated response. Key targets we've already marked as priorities for looting will be assaulted with additional infantry divisions that can be supported as needed by our cavalry. Now that our usual stream of supplies and funding from the Empire have been cut off due to the civil war, we must take matters into our own hands. Any weapons caches and healthy candidates for forced labour take first priority for capture, but our men will be given licence to take anything not nailed down. Provided of course, that it doesn't hamper the effectiveness of our operations overall. The success of our first foray of this new spree of banditry and pillaging hinges on both the speed and viciousness of our assault. There is nothing to be gained from a protracted conflict if our forces are made to entrench themselves, we shall withdraw to the safety of our steppes the second we lose our advantage. To arms men, if all goes according to plan they'll never even see us coming."
TRK_all_bleed:0 "All You Can Bleed"
TRK_all_bleed_desc:0 "If we can make it bleed, we must bleed it for all it's worth. Once a settlement or encampment is caught within our gore-soaked grasp, the ruthless extraction of any and all worth will be total. Anything that we cannot take with us will be put to the torch and razed utterly, if we cannot have it then neither can anyone else. They are not deserving, unlike ourselves. No stone will be left unturned, no building free from ransacking and no would-be survivor safe from our shackles and bayonets. Our raids are a principal source of income and a means of placating the more rabid men of the Seven Rivers Army. Brick by brick, they built the fortresses and mansions that Annenkov and his officers dwell in and there isn't the slightest hint of any notion that this state of affairs should change. This \"bandit kingdom\" of Annenkov's is fuelled by the harvests brought in by the incessant reaving of his frenzied horde of Cossacks and all kinds of other depraved excuses for soldiers. Our recent freedom from the stifling oversight of Petrograd has only deepened our appetite, we are liberated from any need to pretend to be anything other than what we are. Central Asia is our hunting ground, and there's such a wonderful variety of prey in season."
TRK_keeping_limits:0 "Keeping Our Limits"
TRK_keeping_limits_desc:0 "It is important that we don't overplay our hand and trigger a full-scale war. Our objective is to raid, retrieve and retreat to the safety of our borders. Any surplus of materiel gained as a result of our pillaging is worthless if we have to immediately expend it on a bloody frontline against the people we took it from. Discipline must be ruthlessly enforced by our officers, not one squadron will go an inch any deeper into Kazan territory than the border area. Dissenters will be flogged or shot, as a sharp warning to our notoriously ill-disciplined troops that Annenkov remains the ultimate authority on all matters. Once we have finished our operations targeting the border garrisons and villages, the signal will be given for a full withdrawal back towards the safety of our own borders. From there, a short-term defence will be formed in order to deter any would-be pursuers, with any luck they'll soon realise that trying to assail us in retaliation will not be worth the effort."
TRK_pyrite_horde:0 "The Pyrite Horde"
TRK_pyrite_horde_desc:0 "We are not the first horde of raiders to grace these steppes, far from it. Centuries ago, the Golden Horde was born as the mighty Mongol Empire shattered and buckled under its own weight upon the death of the great Ghenghis Khan. Clearly, history has decided to repeat itself in the most amusing of ways. Our fledgling nation has been born the same way, splintering from the bloated corpse of an Empire and emerging into a continent set aflame by the firestorm of civil strife and open warfare. That is where the similarity ends. Unlike the Great Khans of the Golden Horde, we are not the sons of great princes, conquerors and kings. We are not driven by some higher purpose or need to reclaim some lost glory of old as they were. We are indigent, criminal, foul-tongued and blackhearted. Avarice-ridden dreams of glory drive our men forwards in their conquests and a pledge given to a butcher made in equal parts of awe and fear maintains their loyalty. A glittering facade is all we share, the fickle gleam of pyrite. There shall be no quarter given, no hint of peaceful resolution. These lands shall be broken, and picked clean."

Even more importantly, they have no familiarity with our tactics though they surely must be aware of our reputation. They present a far more enticing target for our troops, as the Chinese are frankly in a more delirious and fractured state than the Motherland herself is frankly. What's more, the sinitic rats are sitting upon territory that in part used to rightfully belong to the Russian people! This gives us an excellent pretext for invasion, under the guise of liberating Russian land we can loot, slaughter and reave to our hearts content with the cheers of our countrymen driving us on. We'll seize the very ground they tread upon, nevermind all that they own besides. The so-called \"six cities\" of Altishahr shall be ours, by fire and blood. Once she is, then the real violence can begin. We shall strip her of everything she is worth, and leave her bleeding and beaten in the dirt."

She was once Russian, until pathetic bureaucrats signed her over to the Chinese rather than enforcing our rightful claims. We are owed a debt and we Annenkovites shall collect it with interest. Every available force shall be despatched to the border and ordered to await the Ataman's signal. Our arrival will be swift and brutal, baggage trains will be set up in advance of our assault to ensure we can take as much as we can before torching any settlement we come across to ash. Slaves will be taken in droves, our recent forays are expensive affairs and we need fresh meat before we can put the old and infirm out of their misery in our workshops and factories. It will be two  generations before any indolent Han or Uyghur even dares to look at our border with anything but the utmost terror. The men can hardly wait to begin!"

Xinjiang has been utterly hopeless in their attempts to chase us off and we might as well have carried half the country away with us for all we've robbed them for. The Seven Rivers Army is now the richest and best-equipped it has ever been in its bloody twenty year history. Uighurstan has at last been thoroughly pillaged to the last iota of value thanks to our Cossacks, foreign bandits and mercenaries. It will take them years to recover and mount any sort of meaningful retaliation, if they ever dare to dream of it that is. In the meantime we are free to drink ourselves blind, feast on their food, women and eye up fresh new lands for our forces to subjugate with even greater ferocity."

Whilst many abroad regard us as a \"barbaric backwater rump state\", we have and shall continue to endure in spite of their insipid remarks and sanctions. We rule the lands once dominated by Chagatai Khan, second son of Ghenghis Khan. The most ferocious of the Great Khan's sons, he carved out an empire of his own that lasted for centuries past his death and so shall we.

We shall emulate his rise to power, following in his horrific footsteps as we carve a path of carnage the length and breadth of Central Asia. By the end of his life, he had created the mighty Timurid Empire that stretched from Anatolia to the Indian Subcontinent. We too have our own lofty ambitions. Like Timur, Annenkov was born to minor nobility and also like Timur, he has begun his bloody rise to greatness by seizing power for his own whilst brutally subjugating his neighbours. We shall be the Timurids reborn, a baleful wind howling down from the steppes into the homes of our enemies. None will be able to stand against us."

Their shared petty dreams of rebellion and independence are the very reason that Annenkov is here at all. At last we shall begin to turn our swords and rifles upon them and remind them of their place beneath our boots. Yet we cannot be too hasty, preparations for permanent subjugation are deeper and more complex than banditry and pillaging. Let us prod and test their defences for now. Suitably small and nimble raiding parties will be sent to cross the border, no doubt they have not been blind to our actions over these past months and we should expect them to resist our incursions at every turn. Their efforts will be futile, it matters not how loudly the turkic wolf growls. It will whimper all the same once we drive our sabres through its neck."

Admittedly, now we have the aim of turning it into a nation beholden entirely under Annenkov and ourselves, rather than merely putting it into the incompetent hands of Kolchak and his witless bureaucrats. We must accelerate our preparations in earnest, our forces must be reorganised beyond mere \"resource extraction\" and \"security operations\" for this new task. The transformation of our military into one better able to seize and, most importantly, permanently hold new territory shall be our new priority."

For the rest, a hungry peasant is probably the most effective killing machine if the alternative would be to deprive him of those military rations he so desperately craves? The Ukrainians with the rest... Apparently in this wilderness they have abandoned the idea of independence. Survival counts more. The old Veterans who have settled down may not make a good force, but they will control the new recruits.  Even if the new recruits are difficult we will be able to carve something more solid out of them in time. For now, however, it is our survival that counts, so we will pull even the worst leftovers from the bottom if it helps us control the Turks."

Our existing munitions workshops will be expanded exponentially, with new ones built as well. Relying on individual groups of artisans is not ideal for supplying an army in the 21st century, but we have our own \"special\" ways of helping them increase production. We shall flood them with fresh unwilling hands, be they captured prizes from abroad or a peasant dragged screaming from home and family.

A bullet to the back of the head, or any other method our troops may fancy. Those unlucky enough to be captured alive will be executed immediately. Soldier, deserter or civilian it matters not, what matters is that the corpses serve two purposes for us. Firstly, the dead don't need feeding and can't fight back. Secondly, nothing quite puts the fear in a man like seeing his friends bloated and rotten with vultures neck deep in their eye sockets. Butchery is too soft a word for what we plan to do."

All methods of degradation, destruction and desecration are allowed, the miserable wretches will wish they had never been born. A favourite of the troops is target practice with live moving targets. Cut one churka loose, see if one of the boys can nail him or her with a well-placed shot before they run too far. If the little rat does manage to get out of range, he gets run down and skewered with a lance from horseback. Other popular contests amongst the troops include: seeing who can set up the most gruesome display of butchered civilians as a warning to others, get through the most women in an evening, who can \"clear\" which neighbourhood faster with barrels of drink at stake, and many more debased pursuits besides. Any death of an Annenkovite caused by civilian resistance is met with the most horrific of reprisals, entire towns torched and razed to ash, people and all."

I don't feel sorry for them. Let's show them that they should sit quietly and fuck off. Let's hit them with all the fancy gadgets our Rodina has supplied us with on the front. Their "technology" is nothing but glorified sticks, machetes, and knee-jerk guns made of cow shit! Let us continue terrorising their civilians. Let us sow fear in their hearts. Let turkic mothers tell their children legends of bandit overlords who burn down disobedient villages, hang all the inhabitants on their own ribs then sprinkle salt on their wounds.

We have won the war, now we can turn our eyes towards the labours of true statehood, in our own way of course. The resources available to us now are the gateway to a new era of pillaging and plunder completely unimpeded. Most importantly however, our work must be to consolidate our new holdings. We can hardly reap the rewards we are due if we cannot hold on to our new conquests. Regardless, now is a time for celebration and debauchery. Annenkov has led us to glory once more, cheers!

This applies to our entire state, true unbiased meritocracy. Boris Annenkov is a smart man and knows how to maximise efficiency in any circumstance. Even though we are filled with thugs and black market merchants nothing escapes the Ataman's control.  We do not need purges in the administration to show who is the strongest! Let's just let mother nature work miracles. Let her do our work for us. Our law, the law of strength and the law of savagery. Our hearts are wild and let it stay that way. Untamed and proud!"

Free, irrepressible, and mighty in their conquests. At the root of all power lies primitive strength. Fundamentally, kings such as Clovis I are no different from our Ataman Annekov! Ourselves? We are his nobility. The fact is that man cannot live by war alone. He must have time for entertainment and rest, and thus time to earn capital and reorganise the lands he has conquered. Our generous ataman will distribute the land appropriately by giving it to people he trusts and knows will be good stof the people and resources under them. Of course, how they will do this is no longer important. All that matters is that the churkas do not cause problems. Boris Annekov needs nothing more from his people than loyalty and efficiency!

It would be unthinkable to give the Turks any scrap of power - They are a new untouchable caste who will work for us as serfs and labourers in our factories. They must accept this new state of affairs that we have won the divine right to rule over them! And those who do not accept this new order should prepare to be broken by the wheel! But it is also obvious that betrayal is worse than being born as a Mongoloid. May the worst and most painful tortures be prepared for anyone who challenges the authority of our dear Ataman!

But now it's time to bore us with statecraft. We need to lay the foundations for a nation, because we cannot rule the wilderness forever. That would be even more boring! All the chinks would eventually die out for us! That's why the backache caused by sitting at a desk for long hours is the lesser evil compared to being king of nothing. We will let these subhumans multiply and feed our economy. We will still seemingly be able to drink the best wine and sleep with the most beautiful women, but it will not be the same… ehhh.

It was we who drove ever eastwards settling and claiming new lands in the vastness of the far east of the world, we who broke the teeth of objecting peoples and polities for the sake of our new homes. Losing Ili to the degenerate Qing was one of the great crimes of our history and proof of the ailing state of the Russian Empire.

Machiavelli used to say that it is best to cause love as well as fear in the hearts of people. We doubt that it is our dear subjects who are intelligent enough to understand that what we offer them is nothing.

No... We should apply a little more finesse here. If we extort protection fees.... I mean, taxes! Yes taxes! That's de facto more wealth going into our pockets and not some adventurer's. We should have thought of that earlier. The state is the biggest criminal shack and taxes are nothing more than extortionate fees in exchange for "protection".
