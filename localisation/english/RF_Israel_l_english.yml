But with the Syrian Civil War continuing unabated, a new possibility emerges — not just survival, but true Jewish nationhood, carved out by tenacity, blood, and faith."

Already, in Damascus and other cities, protests are increasing in frequency and intensity."

His family was large, and his skills in selling - larger. He had seen everything up to this point, from Jewish travellers to Russian dockyard workers, and so didn't fear one bit when the Zionist revolt occured. These people weren't enough to cause trouble, no. Not in his beloved Al-Quds.\n\nRifaah al-Munir found himself being stomped on, his teeth falling into the dirt and his chest in severe pain. His mouth bled profusely and his bones crackled at the fierce feeling of the leather against his cheek - perhaps this wasn't the time to be reflecting on the past.\n"Hem Hebri hu em sgulh..."\nThe men above him spoke a language he didn't understand very well, even if it sounded a little similar to his native language. He felt the boots stomp on him harder. His weapon, which he used to fend off against the Zionist rebels, was a couple meters away from him, and he felt his heart ache. Next to him, he saw a man with pale complexion, blue eyes and curly hair. He wondered what he was doing on the ground.\n"Hi Rts-Yshrl bskhumih hmfurshim bsurh..."\nHe begged. He was trying to cry as his eyes only shed blood, and his consciousness slipped out of him. He saw the pale man be taken away, his screaming in a similar language to the one done by the speaker. His comrade in the ground being rudely taken upwards to a dirt wall next to the commotion.\n"S Rts-Yshrl khbsh yshrl Bkhrb."\nAs Rifaah felt the boots break his skull even further, he saw his pale friend be dragged onto the wall and be tied up in some way. He continued watching, but his consciousness slipped away like the dirt in his face drenched itself in blood. He only could wonder what they were saying..."
ISR.1.a:0 "Lmen Humh."

ISR.2.t:0 "First Elections to the Knesset"
ISR.2.desc:0 "Now that the chaos of post-independence has been dealt with, the time has come for the Yishuv's first ever general election in order to select its first prime minister, as well as define the character of our state.\n\nThe immediate frontrunner is David Ben-Gurion representing the Mapai. The party rejects both the Marxism of Poale Zion and the nationalism of Revisionist Zionism. Although the party advocates for liberal democracy, they also emphasize the need for social programs and worker's rights in a uniquely Zionist conception of socialism. Critics from both the right and left have called the Mapai a more moderate version of Poale Zion, and the radical socialists have decried the two working together in a potential coalition. But the magnetism of Ben-Gurion is a strong draw, and the moderate left have the easiest path to election victory. The Mapai has also refused to make statements on Palestine, stating that the needs of the Jewish people should be taken care of before the issue can even be discussed internally.\n\nThe primary opposition to Ben-Gurion is Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the Revisionist Zionists. This party believes in territorial maximalism for Israel, expansionism and militarism, and encouragement of immigration by non-Israeli Jews to the land of Israel. This militarist and right-wing form of Zionism means that the rights of Palestinians will be secondary to the creation of a Greater Israel. Jabotinsky's connections with the British also means his party are pro-Commonwealth, and will seek the help of the British if needed.\n\nThe final group, which has the least amount of popular support, are the Labour Zionists. The two Socialist-Zionist parties, Poale Zion and Palestine Communist Party both seek to establish a worker's state in the land of Israel, so that the Jewish proletariat can participate in the international class struggle, in much the same fashion as the Germans. The Palestine Communist Party have also adopted a Marxist view of history and colonialism as part of their party platform, and are thus somewhat more willing to cooperate with the native Arab population, though not to the detriment of Israel. The Poale Zion however are more moderate, although the party advocates for socialism, and will cooperate with both the Mapai and Palestine Communists, they believe the Mapai policies to be too soft and liberal, and the Palestine Communists too radical, hampering their vote share. Any strongly leftist government will be a coalition of sorts, and the leadership question is hotly debated."
ISR.2.a:0 "Ben-Gurion's Mapai are Victorious."
ISR.2.b:0 "Jabotinsky's Revisionist Zionists are Victorious."
ISR.2.c:0 "The left begins negotiations."

ISR.201.t:0 "Albert Einstein Invited to Lead the Yishuv"
ISR.201.desc:0 "The elections have returned an inconclusive result, but internal negotiations among socialists returned only one name that both could agree on to lead the coalition - famed Jewish theoretical physicist Albert Einstein. Although currently living in Germany, Einstein has been vocal in his support of the fledgling state, and has shown support for the socialist cause, applauding the recent election victory and the defeat of the Revisionist Zionists.\n\nAfter some assurances from the parties wore through his humility, Einstein graciously accepted the proposal, a radio reading of his acceptance letter thanking the Jewish people for welcoming him with such enthusiasm was well received in Tel Aviv. The chief condition of Einstein's premiership it seems, is unity among the working people, as he has stated that the Jewish people can never prosper while the proletariat cannibalizes itself. The new coalition between Palestine Communist Party is now under pressure to cooperate, lest they fail Einstein. While radicals from both parties have objected, stating that neither the coalition nor its constituent parties will survive such a merger, the vast majority of both the people and party members have celebrated its founding."
ISR.201.a:0 "Let's see if Einstein keeps this big tent from blowing over."


ISR.5.t:0 "운동 내 분열"
ISR.5.desc:0 "Now that the Yishuv has won its independence and the ineffectual state of Syria has been dealt with for now, the Zionist movement has reached a critical point in its history. With the Jewish state secure from British colonialism and Arab revolution, there is no longer anything left to unify the various political factions of the state. As the Labour Zionists, the Palestine Communist Party, and the Revisionist Zionists under Ze'ev Jabotinsky attempted to form a new government, radicals in the Lehi and Irgun turned on Jabotinsky, Declaring him to be a "False Zionist", despite being the founder of their ideology. Jabotinsky has responded by reaffirming his pro-government position, labeling the Irgun and Lehi as treasonous rebels merely masquerading as Zionists. Haim Wizman, provisional president of Israel, made attempts to mediate the conflict between the two groups, but was unsuccessful in even getting them to agree to a negotiation. In a last ditch effort to avoid persecution by the newly formed Mossad, Avraham Stern has led joint Irgun-Lehi forces in an assault on the capitol in an attempt to arrest Jabotinsky and coup the government. As Stern's cabal tried to march up the steps of the capitol building, they found Haganah militias waiting for them there. Thinking quickly, Stern improvised a speech to sway them to their side.

ISR.7.desc:0 "The Palestinian government, in consultation with the eminent physicist Albert Einstein, decided that the meddling of great world politics would be unhealthy for the Palestinian Socialist Commonwealth, and the benefits of joining the Rotfront would be less than the disadvantages. The Palestinians believe their state and Red Iran have similar goals. Cooperation and alliance will be quite beneficial for both sides, both countries will guard the other's back, and friendship will result in unquestionable benefits and comforts for the civilians. They ask that we should consider a potential request for an alliance as we have common enemies, so although the country is young and small, the combined Persian-Palestinian forces will be able to overcome the local Arab threat and bring a period of peace to the Middle East."

The chairman should consider what to do in this situation. Palestine may be a valuable asset in the task of world revolution, but at the same time it may draw the Rotfront into a premature war with the British. Recognition of Israel's independence will cause Arab workers to view Germany with skeptical eyes which will slow the expansion of socialism in the Middle East.On the other hand, however, in the long run and with small efforts on the part of Germany, it will enable the creation of a socialist fortress in the Middle East, which will be able to flourish under German protection. It will also be seen as a blow against world capital in view of the exceptionally tragic history of the Jews which will give Germany the title of defender of the oppressed. No matter what decision the president makes, it will eventually have to be answered to the government in Jerusalem."

The Intermarium would gain an informal ally to help attack the British colonies, but the Jews want material support in return. It is more a pragmatic cooperation resulting current politics than a true proposal of friendship. The Jews still remember their persecution under the old governments of the Pale, but the Zionists are prepared to forget these wrongs as long as the Intermarium supports the Jews militarily. This will allow the Jews to gather the necessary forces to make an effective offensive, and in return the Intermarium will be able to deal a serious blow to the British and their pawns."

The perfidious Polish responded aggressively to the request of the Jews. They do not intend to support a relatively weak state that may turn against them in the long run. They called Stern's reign crypto-reactionary, considering elements such as secular traditionalism or collaboration with religious sects as an aberration. The investment in Zion could turn against the Polish because they are not even sure whether the Jews will actually be willing to support the Intermarium in a potential war against the British. Stern believed that even without the Intermarium, the Lehi government would be able to defend itself against the Arabs and the British, but nevertheless felt disappointed by the attitude of the Intermarium, who seem unable to let go of their Jew-hating past."

Britain will gain a valuable ally in the Middle East because even though Israel is a young, small country, it has quite a strong development potential. The problem is that Israel does not have good relations with the Arab states, which may end in increasing oil prices, but also the risk of Arab attacks on the Trucial States. Not to mention bringing Britain into a potential war in the Middle East. At a time of global instability, providing rival powers the chance to weaken British influence in the Middle East and could even deprive British Trucial States on the Arabian peninsula.

However, the encroaching forces of German socialism and Russian autocracy and the establishment of our Jewish state have made many Jews reconsider their decisions.

Additionally, the very man who started the program has become its most outspoken opponent, Albert Einstein.

ISR_supportthecanaanistmovement_desc:0 "The Canaanists are an important avant-garde movement or artists and writers. They have been staunch supporters of the Lehi and revisionist Zionism. We ought to return the favour in the form of offical patronage for their works. Political Canaanism is in its infancy, but it promises to be the bulwark of cultural growth Israel needs."

ISR_allywiththefrench_desc:0 "The Lehi's agents back in the Pale have been quick to introduce us to the Polish Sanacja government. Warm words have been exchanged for weeks, but the time has come for formal diplomatic moves. The Intermarium are gearing up for a decisive war on the bastards Tsars and all regimes of old, and with their help we can poistion ourselves as the secret flank to their actions - an informal ally in the near-east."

However, we live in a time of technological advancements that allow us to learn and communicate like never before; radio, television, and film. All of these technologies can be placed under the direct control of the state, so that our ideas can be spread and seep into the hearts and minds of patriotic Hebrews."

Our enemies will divide an unstable Israel easily, and our own population seems increasingly unhappy with millitary control, border restrictions and police crackdowns on unrest.\nThe facts on the ground have been set,  but It is time to begin integrating our religious minorities into all elements of society, conducting proper diplomacy with our neighbours and paving new roads connecting Transjordan to the Rest of our country.\nWe must set the stage for a stable and prosperous Israel - forevermore."
ISR_industrialcenters:0 "Industrial Centres"

ISR_independentproduction:0 "자체생산"

British Lee-Enfields, German Karabiners, and Swiss Schmidt-Rubins and respective bundles of ammunition are all heaped together - and naturally, all of these guns are built differently, maintained differently, and used differently. What a mess. Building a single rifle of an indigenous design will ease up the strain on both our troops and our quartermasters."
ISR_ruthlesstraining:0 "혹독한 훈련"
ISR_ruthlesstraining_desc:0 "Our new air force now has planes and pilots, but to put those two together to create a fighting force is not so simple. The air wings of our foes have had decades to practice and refine their tactics, and we have had mere months. There’s only one way to catch up to that advantage of experience - hard graft. We need practice flights, repeated drills, constant maintenance, hours of schooling, of study, and of thought. We will do whatever it takes to get our air force up to scratch, even if the airmen aren’t happy about it. Let us hope they understand it is for the greater good."
ISR_thefutureofarialcombat:0 "항공전의 미래"
ISR_thefutureofarialcombat_desc:0 "Much has changed over the last few years, and it appears much will continue to change.

ISR_modernartillery:0 "Modern Artillery"
ISR_modernartillery_desc:0 "Our country prides itself in our four-thousand-year history, but our current artillery stockpile perhaps has a little too much history – with old Great War howitzers taken from the French and British, as well as a few old Ottoman cannon.

ISR_rewardlargefamilies:0 "Reward Large Families"
ISR_rewardlargefamilies_desc:0 "Our people are few, and stand on shaky ground. Many fear what may happen to the fledgling Israel over the next decade, and do not wish to start families. No! We must assuage this fear, let our people know that we are tough and shall triumph over all adversity. We must encourage people to settle down, to build large families and communities, and give them something to fight for. For each baby past your third, we shall provide monetary support to our crucial mothers so that they can raise a new generation of Israelis into our bright future."
ISR_modernindustry:0 "근대 산업"
ISR_modernindustry_desc:0 "Perhaps unsurprisingly, given this land’s status as a former British colony, but our industry is a mess. What little there is serves only what the British could exploit and sell – primarily oil, magnesium, and diamonds.
