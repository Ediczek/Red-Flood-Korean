From the conquest of Siberia through Imperial rule, he endured. And then, with the civil war an opportunity came — but the Eagle cared not, sending Stark in to keep its order afloat. In 1936, another opportunity came, yet that ended up vanquished too. And now? The fourth incarnation of Sakha is here, weaker than ever, even if it will outlast all the others. The murder of Pavel Ksenofontov and his compatriots has been one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century, one for which all Sakha have paid so dearly. What good is our natural resilience in the face of lacking manpower and professional cadres? There are things folk wisdom just cannot build. Our dream, although realized, is just a shell. Despite peace, tough times are coming for our state, and we must ask ourselves - will the blood of a Sakha persevere through this?"

While we simply want all in Yakutia to be equal, the Strakocracy wished to make the majority of Russians face the boot of a small clique in service to Moscow. Who sounds like the real Russophobes?\"\n\nThe soldiers applauded and chanted 'For a Free Russia!'. With that Pavel left the stage, happy the sailors were behind him but terrified for the future of an independent Siberia."

This, however, began to slowly change. Factory chimneys began to dominate the wasteland and apartment blocks began to expand. Cities began to be born. They were not the biggest and the greatest, but they were symbols of a developing industry. But the center of human life was elsewhere. Igor - a young farmer driven out of Mongolia by the incessant and enduring conflicts between the shamanistic Bolsheviks, the mad baron, and God knows who else. After his father's death, he had nothing left to link him to this place, he decided that it would be best to cremate his father's body, as he was afraid of desecrating his burial place. So he carried in his backpack, in addition to the most necessary things, also a small urn with his ashes. He traveled such a long way, because he saw in this foreign country a chance for a new life. Radola Gajda, or whatever the Czech was called, began the process of colonizing Yakutia by bringing farmers from all over the Russian Empire so that they could at least try to grow anything on this frozen land. Igor noticed the offer as well as an additional benefit in the form of the possibility to buy a tractor and land at profitable prices. He couldn't afford to miss such an opportunity. After walking for several hours, he stopped and took the map out of the bundle. He had the position of his land marked on it. According to the assurances of the buyer, there was also supposed to be a small single-family cottage here. The sight he saw disappointed him quite badly. The hut was much smaller and would not hold a single cow in winter. The thatch was broken and in many places there were holes from decayed boards. The windows were shattered and glass lay in and beside the hut. He said to himself. \n\n\"I have a really long job ahead of me ... But even that is better than getting a bullet over there in Mongolia.\" \n\nAfter this brief reflection, he didn't say anything more, but started looking for wood, especially boards to rebuild the hut and forest litter to repair the thatch. He had his own nails with him, and it was the same with simple tools. Glass will have to be ordered from town, which he will do when he goes to buy a tractor. He boarded the windows and started the necessary repairs to his new home. After a day of repairs, he finally managed to rest, but his rest had to end quite quickly at 6:00 am on the frost of the next day. He left a relatively warm hut to start looking for a field for sowing. He noticed a place that was already quite shabby, so he didn't have to bother too much to finish the job. It wasn't perfect, but he wanted to get over it. It was not a large field, but without a plow and animals, it was a difficult task for one man. He finished around noon. He sighed tiredly and said to himself. \n\n\"My father would be proud of me to see what a farmer out of me\" \n\nHe became saddened, fleeing his childhood thoughts, and remembered one more task he had to fulfill. He went to get his father's urn and scattered ashes in the field. The ashes were sprayed like mist and quickly hit the ground prepared for sowing.

Igor marched through forests and meadows for quite a long time, and finally he noticed the \"gates\" of Yakutsk, which were a series of long and tall buildings, breathed a sigh of relief that at least this element of the journey was behind him. He began to walk deeper into the city in his peasant clothes, some more chic people noticed him, but he did not differ that much from most of the city's inhabitants. However, it attracted the attention of someone else - of two young and wayward soldiers who accosted the man. \n\nAre you new to this city?\" \n\n\"Yes but to whom I’m speaking?\" \n\nIgor was kinda concerned as the men held guns on their shoulders. The soldier smiled slyly and said. \n\n\"Gefreiter Slopowsky and Private Toppowsky. We marched through the city for exercise and are currently on leave. We were so eager to eat and drink ...\"\n\nIgor understood what was going on and said. \n\n\"I can’t give you my food and money. I have only one piece of bread and a cup of chestnut coffee. I have money, but it's deducted to buy a tractor and grain without which I won't be able to grow anything. Please don't take this away from me…\"  \n\n\"Everything for the army and the motherland!\" Toppovsky laughed and said. \n\nThe soldiers pushed Igor to fall and drop his bundle. Toppovsky aimed his rifle at Igor so that he wouldn't try to lift himself up and Slopowsky searched his bag. Then they stole it and fled, leaving Igor with no belongings. Igor got up from the cold floor and tried to see if anyone had stopped the thieves - no one stopped them or cared about Igor being robbed on a white day. Until the evening he stood under the command, trying to punish the criminals, but the police were not willing to accept him at all, hearing rumors of a theft near the market square. Igor, not knowing what to do, began to slowly return to his home with an empty stomach and without a tractor or seed to sow."

He was driving it to the city now, which made his life much easier. He was more careful now, especially since he managed to smuggle a self-defense revolver from his old acquaintances in Mongolia. He was currently in one of the nearby villages to vote for a local county governor. Igor was not stupid and he understood that at least the regional elections counted because it dictated whether or not they would get any help. In the time after harvest, he also didn't have much work to do anymore, wanting to rest, so he figured he would organize a little tractor ride to see what it looked like. He waited a little, but not long to get into the ballot box. He didn't like the way the soldiers stood and watched the voting process, but he didn't care that much. He studied the card carefully, reading it from cover to cover. He was not a professor, but he could read and write, but he did not understand anything he read. The voting process was so complicated that he wasn't sure who he voted for. At one point he gave up on it and began to fill blindly, being annoyed with how the card was contoured in such a way that no one could understand. He gave his vote to the urn and left the room calmly towards the tractor. He got on it and fired it to start slowly moving away. It was not the most irritating moment in his life, but he had to say that the election was pointless because the person who was supposed to win would win anyway. It is not who votes for someone that counts, but who counts those votes. "

Alexander Nevsky understood that faith unites us and that the Christ of the Slavs cannot be allowed to be replaced by Christ who humiliates us and considers us inferior! Therefore, he opposed the naughty attempts to destroy the Slavic identity by the Teutonic and Swedish, knowing that he must be a skillful politician if he wanted to survive between pagan Tatars and aggressive Germanic people. We intend to continue his mission by creating a great Christian community free from external influences on our politics and soul.

The waves that rock the ship makes these men, even on land, walk in a very peculiar way, swaying side to side to accomodate for nonexistent currents. Life, even politics, is seen from the perspective of the sea towards the land, and not the other way around. Like a web of neural connections, the sea winds and routes become a map in the sailor’s brain, more accurate than any city’s layout.  \n\nAdmiral Stark is no different, with his peculiar swaying walk, his thalassocratic passions, and his love for mariner habits and songs. His secretaries report his curious habit of managing government affairs from a small pleasure ship, when his melancholic episodes are especially difficult and when the weather permits. The life of Admiral Stark is one of longing for life back at the sea, braving the untamed waters of the Arctic, and yet he drowns in dull paperwork. Necessary paperwork. Without it, the last link in the Russian Empire’s steel chain from the Baltics to the warm Pacific would break. Stark’s honour and resilience will avoid this disaster under any cost."

This rabble led by Pavel Ksenofontov have been a thorn in our side for a long time, but new developments make their existence intolerable to us.

However, many Czech brethren stayed behind and rallied under the Empire's banner, aiding us in our fraternal carnage.

As a reward for their service, they were granted settlement in Yakutia and engrained within the power mechanics of the governorate. \n\nFifteen years later, however, Gajda and his men are beginning to show signs of discontent. They are no closer to the liberation of Bohemia than in 1914, and many resent Kolchak's lack of action regarding the Panslavic cause. Although the Legion is a crucial element of our rulership, if they prove to be too problematic we will be forced to dispose of rebellious ringleaders eventually.

This process has been repeated year after year since Genesis. Much like this sea, Yakutia is a slow and steady constant that despite its little movement and barely different patterns always operates in the same fashion. No radicals and no natives can change the natural course of our governorate, just like they can't change the fact the sea freezes on winter or the currents that govern the movement of the ice.
