#BOOKMARKS
KOLCHAK_RUSSIAN_DESC:0 "키예프에서 벌어진 니콜라이 2세 살해는 러시아를 뒤흔들었습니다. 스톨리핀 총리가 이끄는 자신감 넘치는 정부는 나라를 안정시키고 2차 조국전쟁 또한 이겨냈습니다. 그러나 전쟁은 러시아 국민의 정신을 무너트렸습니다. 반역적인 진보주의자들과 함께 사회주의자들은 나라를 혼란에 빠뜨렸습니다. 다행히 맹세를 충실히 지킨 장교와 백성들의 노력으로 나라의 멸망은 막아냈습니다. 이제 10년이 지났고 러시아는 회복되었습니다. 알렉산드르 콜차크는 조타를 단단히 잡았지만 러시아 전역에 구름이 짙어졌습니다. 제독은 다가오는 홍수를 견뎌낼까요, 아니면 개울물이 러시아를 역사의 바위 위로 날려버릴까요?"

The music is bright, full-faced and ruddy-cheeked, like a young woman from a cloth hall, brave and impudent like a curly young man in a brand new fur coat, who deftly and boldly drives his three-horses chaise, and it seems like he will crush everything that will not be lucky to happen on his way. The music then falls, as if diving into the depths of the blue sea, and then soars, as if into the sky, deep, strong, but… quite old-fashioned.\nThis \"Russian dance\" is coming to an end, but the couples continue to waltz, and the sound of boots rings in the ears. In the center of the hall, on a shiny parquet, dancing beautiful pairs of mother-of-pearl and crimson silk - ladies in embroidered kokoshniks and old-fashioned sundresses (oh, how many seamstresses and shoemakers worked on them!), and gentlemen in high kaftans, girded with colorful belts. Lubochnaya greatness, as if the time of Alexei Mikhailovich returned, for a moment, from its bed, covered with a sable fur coat of past epochs - returned to hide in the folds of classical canopies and modern waltzes of French courtiers. Where have you disappeared, a beautiful epoch of peace and idyll! ... Here is the master of the ball, the old Count Turov dancing with his respectable, furry-sabled wife, himself like a boyar from the epics. Senior Turov, Sasha, a dandy and a fashionista, with a thin black mustache and a quick look, is nearby. His partner, the young Sofia Troekurova, a model of pure youth, not yet tarnished with the storm of life, completely languished. Maybe it is too hot in a heavy dress or maybe look of Sasha too sensual. They are a beautiful couple. Here is a thin and strict stereotype of the Ostsee German, Andrew von Wenkenbach, trying to look as always decent, but still embarrassed under the stubborn pressure of Countess Ukhtomskaya. The ladies whisper with smiles that the Countess seems to have decided to stop being an old maid, she flatters the embarrassed Mr. Andrew so much. Not everyone dances - junior Turov, Roman, stood without a partner and participate in the sluggish conversations between those who do not dance. He is not in his plate, he is squeezed by the collar of his kaftan, even this room is squeezing him, to be honest. Roman would rather be in St. Petersburg again, among his non-noble friends, rather than these disheveled antiquities. But whatever, he promised his father, it would be very bad to embarrass him and not show up. Eventually, he and Alina will need this damn money, sooner rather than later.\nAnd then the music fades again, and this time finally. The couples mix and go aside, while a servant comes out on the center, and solemnly announces:"

In fact four of them looked down on the town from each side of the tower like faces of ancient idols slavs build for their gods. There was no place to hide from Her soft, motherly gaze. She was beautiful. Youthful like spring but with knowing smile betraying wisdom of a woman beyond human age. Every detail of those massive portraits were in downright mathematical meticulousness chosen to soothe fears and anxieties of Her loyal subjects and bring fear in those hiding something from her blue gaze. Did she really look like that? Few really seen her up close. None would dare to deny. \n\nYuri sat in his chair, the old piece of bug-infested furniture creaked uncomfortably. He was a man in his late twenties but harsh winters and even harsher factory work gave him a face and hands of someone twice his age. Lack of sleep didn't help neither. But how can one sleep when there are leaflets to print? Truth to spread? None of this even mattered anymore. They knew what he was doing. They took Sasha yesterday. By now he told them everything they could ever want to know and more. How did they figured them out? Was there a traitor among them? None of this even mattered anymore. Yuri rested his tired face in his cold hands. He didn't even feel like crying. He didn't feel like anything. He just wanted it to be over with. He won't give those animals satisfaction of chasing him like a helpless rabbit. Chasing down prey is all they are good at. No sense in trying them. Those sick dogs like it. \n\nAt first there was this strange stillness. Untraceable air of incoming doom like that before a storm. But people still walked the streets, fat saleswoman still stood by her cart offering sweets to them. Children dressed in furry hats still stared hungrily at candy, their noses and cheeks red from the cold. Then the growl began. Monstrous, devilish noise made by packs of hungry dogs chasing after their prey. Primal and hateful, unfit for bustle of a city nor any place where civilized men dwelt. But also metallic and unnatural, not one any of God's creatures can make. But people on the street knew what that noise was. It was way worse than howl of a hungry wolf or laughter of Devil himself. It was song of motorcycle engines of Her Majesty's attack dogs. People moved aside. Some to make room for the incoming machines, some to press their faces against the wall and not see, not hear those black dogs, those hellhounds. \n\nRumors about them were too fantastical to believe but too frighting to ignore. They were dead warriors dug out of ancient kurhans and resurrected by some unknown science. They were demons bound by some saint into service to the crown. They were werewolves dressed like men and set to do government's bidding. They ate human flesh, they couldn't be killed by normal weapons, they bleed engine oil and fire. \n\nYuri heard the roar of engines. They were coming. They didn't worry he will run. No one will help him him. A man with Oprychnina on his back was a cursed man. The horde of savages clad in black leather, furs and animal skulls was able to sniff him everywhere and chase up to corners of the Empire. To help him was to sign your death warrant. To hide him was to condemn your family to prisons and worse. Yuri knew that they were after him. None of this even mattered anymore. \n\nWhen oprychniks barged into his room they only found a still fresh corpse hanging from a rope..."

But they have now lost control, as the purge has progressed, certain groups of the Mladorossi, as well as the reactionary militias, have become more powerful than the government intended. With some factional fighting having broken out in Tatarstan, the two groups are now executing an armed struggle and are both threatening the internal stability of the Empire. Diterikh's populist militias and Aleksandr Kazam-bek's Mladorossi have grown into small armies in their own right. The Army has indeed reported rife defections, armouries have been raided, units dissolved and officers gone AWOL, the central government is now without the military means to end the conflict on their terms. So, with little appetite for yet more bloodshed among brothers, both sides have demanded an end to the hostilities before a wider war breaks out.

While many remain certain that the government will be able to handle the crisis, others aren't so sure, and have suggested to help deal with the socialist vermin that we recruit the help of more… radical elements. The support comes in the form of the Union of Young Russia, also known as the Union of Mladorossi or just Mladorossi, a party which espouses the return of the monarchy under a new ideology of "Tsar and Soviets". Another group that can support us is the followers of Mikhail Diterikhs whose radical Christian fanaticism can be of use in our purge.\nThere is some internal opposition to working with these groups, several ministers claim that by working with them, it might help legitimise their status in Russia and allow them to grow in influence, recreating a problem that the government set out to fix in the first place. However many others support and welcome their help as several government officials don't see the harm in allowing radicals to help purge socialist agitators across Russia. They view this as a way to contain the influence of both the Mladorossi and Diterikhs, and allow them to be used as tools of the government.\nWhatever choice will be made, one thing is for certain. The final destruction of socialism in Russia is at hand."

However, technological progress gave us power over time and by the start of the XX century it didn't take months but days to get from Petrograd to Kamchatka.

Stymieing these movements by recognising and respecting the varied nationalities of our great nation and granting them a modicum of autonomy will take the wind out those dreamers’ sails, securing our lands and making sure that non-Russians are invested in the continuation of the Russian state."

RUS_russification_intensifies_desc:0 "All people dream of being Russians. At least, that’s what will be written on the posters that will soon be in every town and village beyond the Volga, the Don, and the Urals. Schoolchildren will be taught in Russian, and immigrants from central Russia will set up factories, churches, and workhouses to teach our citizens the right way to live - the Russian way."

It doesn’t matter what God you worship, what dialect or language you speak, or what ancestry you claim, as long as you will fight for our cause. If they fight for us, then we will leave them be."

The period of his reign was not easy for Rodina but that was only one of the chapters in its history, which has already become a part of the past. Now we cannot afford to constantly grieve over the past days of greatness and must get rid of any, even the slightest, thoughts about the "death of Russia". Under the guidance of a wise Glava, we’ll take into account the experience of past years and lead the homeland to a new golden age. Glory to the new Russia! Glory to the future!"

RUS_crown_a_tsaritsa_desc:0 "The Mladorossi seek not a reactionary Tsar, nor a puppet nephew or cousin of the late Tsar Nicholas II. They will settle for no less than the last Tsar's sister Anastasia. From where the Mladorossi have brought her few are sure. Some claim she has been under their protection since 1920, others claim she is some imposter, dragged out of the shadows from some ambitious aristocratic family. Whatever the case may be, the crown is now hers, Tsaritsa Anastasia I. Long may she reign."

This is not to a small extent connected with Orthodoxy, which teaches humility and obedience; without it, it is simply unthinkable to imagine Russia.

RUS_unify_empire_desc:0 "The time of decentralisation has passed. The old policy kept our hopes alive during our darkest years, but now many of the warlords we once had under our heel have declared their independence in defiance of Moscow. Bad news for them, however - Russia is not the limping, rotten mess that it once was, but instead is proud, mighty, and more than willing to reclaim what has been lost."
RUS_reintegrate_baltic:0 "발트 열국 재흡수"
RUS_reintegrate_baltic_desc:0 "Petrograd is the gateway from the Baltic into Russia, and yet just 150km away from our capital is the foul roost of the usurpers of the Baltic General Governorate. The sizable contingent of Germans, Latvians and Estonians who live alongside our Russians will only cause problems - best to nip any infant nationalism in the bud to save a potential national security disaster."
RUS_ultimatum_to_south_east:0 "남동연합에 보내는 최후통첩"
RUS_ultimatum_to_south_east_desc:0 "The South-Eastern Union’s strange attempt at democracy has failed, and failed badly. The fertile Kuban and the oil fields of the North Caucasus lie in their ineffective and weak hands. To save them from themselves, we must attack, and restore order."
RUS_ultimatum_to_orenburg:0 "오렌부르크에 보내는 최후통첩"
RUS_ultimatum_to_orenburg_desc:0 "Orenberg is the gateway to Siberia, to the whole East. The Miass river and the passes through the central Urals between Perm and Yekaterinburg are of the utmost strategic value. Mounting a conquest of Orenburg is an essential first step in our push east to reclaim what is rightly ours."
RUS_retake_the_steppe:0 "대초원을 다시 가져오며"
RUS_retake_the_steppe_desc:0 "The vast steppes, though sparsely populated and with little industry to speak of, are nonetheless an important component of our geopolitical security. So long as there is flat, unobstructed land between us and our enemies, we are in danger - to alleviate this, the steppes of Central Asia must be under our control. With the Pamir to the east, the Caspian to the west, and the muddy, swirling currents of the Amu Darya to the south, our position will be immeasurably safer."
RUS_retake_siberia:0 "시비리 탈환"
RUS_retake_siberia_desc:0 "Siberia, for a long time Imperial Russia’s penal colony, is a fabulously rich swath of land. Huge quantities of precious metals abound in the frozen tundra, with extensive old growth forest too. Ever since the modern Russian state was built by Ivan the Terrible in the 1500s, the domain of Siberia was ours and ours alone - and the plucky rebels currently squatting there would do well to remember that. Perhaps they need a reminder?"
RUS_secure_altay:0 "알타이 확보"
RUS_secure_altay_desc:0 "Sitting at the junction of the Siberian tundra, the Kazakh Steppe, and the deserts of Mongolia and Xinjiang, Altay is the border guard and the watchtower for the entire region. We would do well to bring it back into the fold."
RUS_ultimatum_to_yakutsk:0 "야쿠츠크에 보내는 최후통첩"
RUS_ultimatum_to_yakutsk_desc:0 "As we follow in the footsteps of Yermak Timofeyevich and recreate the conquests of 400 years prior, we are a single step away from seeing the tranquil Pacific once again. Only Yakutia, with its esoteric sprinklings of the Japanese, old Russian seamen from the Pacific Fleet, and the indigenous Yakuts, remains in our way. By now, they will be well aware of our looming army, but we can make the choice easy for them - submit, or be swept aside."
RUS_crush_rogue_officer:0 "시묘뇨프 척살"
RUS_crush_rogue_officer_desc:0 "Semyonov’s Cossacks betraying Kolchak and the Whites in 1925 to found their own bandit state is a wound that has never really healed. While the Buryat wilds are slightly less lawless than they were back then, they could certainly use some judicious application of Russian law."
RUS_finish_zhelto:0 "공화주의파와의 결전"
RUS_finish_zhelto_desc:0 "With the destruction of the Trans-Siberian Railway during the Russian Civil War impeding our ability to pursue them, the bastard socialists and their hangers-on managed to limp their way to Manchuria and pitch their tents in the Far East. But we and them have unfinished business, and now that we are at their doorstep, they ought to be trembling in their boots. Though their revolution failed, the embers have never been stamped out - and it’s high time to correct that."

RUS_our_duty_to_order_desc:0 "Now that we have finished bringing together all our rebellious subjects, it is time to renew our holy mission to order and turn west. Since 1798, we have had a commitment to end every petulant revolution and we will maintain this task until Christ returns. So let us look at the situation in Europe to see who can be called on to do what must be done to end these defilers of Christ."
RUS_renew_pact:0 "자작나무 서약 갱신"
RUS_renew_pact_desc:0 "The entire reason we fight is for order and continuity, so why not return to what we know? Birkeneid remains the bastion of order and has only become more committed to the cause of tearing down the liberal lie since our recent troubles. United with our Nordic cousins, we will descend from the North to the South of Europe and wash away this false and decrepit modern man who believes himself to be enlightened. For his enlightenment is merely a candle to the forest fire of our ancient tradition in Christ."
RUS_a_road_we_walk_alone:0 "홀로 걷는 길"
RUS_a_road_we_walk_alone_desc:0 "Once again we have been left abandoned by all our allies, left to stand completely on our own. All of Europe has fallen to the wave of revolution but it is of no concern. We are strong enough to tear down all of Europe completely alone. We did it in 1812, and we can certainly do it again. In fact, we welcome it since we will not have to share or compromise anything in our inevitable victory. Pure order will reign and it will reign for all time."
RUS_holy_alliance:0 "새로운 신성동맹"
RUS_holy_alliance_desc:0 "While the Birkeneid was a useful stopgap against the revolutions of 1918, we will need something more permanent to go on the offensive. We shall look back on our past and bring together the three bastions of, what our enemies sneeringly call, reaction to end the liberal wave. So let us return to 1815 and make a toast to a New Holy Alliance which will protect the divine right of kings against the falsely enthroned idea of constitutions and republics."
RUS_treaty_two_emperors:0 "두 황제의 조약"
RUS_treaty_two_emperors_desc:0 "Unfortunately our Prussian allies have fallen to the siren song of liberalism, just as they did in 1805. But in losing one friend, we merely had a chance to gain another, as Austria has awoken from its slumber and a new Emperor who is truly up to the task of tearing down the revolution has stepped up to the plate. Let us create a treaty of friendship, a treaty which will shake the revolution to its bones and renew the ancient tradition in Europe."
RUS_war_russia:0 "신성한 삼위의 러시아를 위한 전쟁"
RUS_war_russia_desc:0 "It is a misnomer to say Russia is united while Belarus and Ukraine fall outside her borders. Our first and most pressing task is to finish the unification of Russia and put down the source for its division: Warsaw. We will douse the foul "promethean" flame that emanates from the Lechitic Land and return to our proper territory before the tragic war of 1913."
RUS_anti_spartakist_crusade:0 "반스파르타쿠스주의 성전"
RUS_anti_spartakist_crusade_desc:0 "While the Intermarium disgusted us for occupying Holy and Triune Russia, Germany horrifies us. It openly declares itself against all that is good and true in the world for the hope of a utopia more terrifying than the most lurid descriptions of Hell. We must put down this Judeo-Spartakist experiment post-haste, every moment it is allowed to live is a crime against God."
RUS_most_unholy_beast:0 "가장 불경한 짐승"
RUS_most_unholy_beast_desc:0 "Perhaps we were too harsh on Germany. The communists in Berlin might have been rancid Jews but the Bolshevists in Paris seem to be demons sent directly from the ninth circle of Hell. It is the most rancid elements of every revolution of the past 150 years put together and made even worse. Even observing them makes one feel ill.\n\nBut it is sickeningly fitting that our crusade ends with them. They are the revolution made pure, the darkest elements of nihilism brought to the forefront. When we enter what they have falsely labeled "Le Soleil", we will burn it to the ground and salt the earth. For this whole rotten experiment in modernity began in Paris and it will end in Paris, once and for all."
