 fir.1.desc:0 "The Provisional Council Congress had been in a deadlock for two weeks now, revolving around itself amidst the chaos of civil war, on the very cusp of impotent instability. By some miracle of human obstinacy however, its constituent members debated endlessly about how Finland's revolution should best proceed without considering that it had only just barely left the cradle. Letting out a weary sigh, Pentti set down his notebook and dabbed at the beads of sweat on his brow with a handkerchief. Below his seat on the upper balcony, the meaningless storm of arguments continued in the parliament chamber. How on earth could he write a decent article like this? Justice for working class Finns postponed because we can't seem to agree on bylines and minutiae? Sorry everyone, we're going to sit around twiddling our thumbs while the reactionary Whites advance, bayonets in hand?\n\nSuddenly he found his morose daydreaming was broken suddenly, by the sound of a great commotion occurring outside the chamber. Muffled shouting and the clattering of boots growing slowly louder seemed to have a subduing effect, the congress members slowly lowering their voices and turning to the entranceway in bewilderment and nervous anticipation. Some even tried to bar the entranceway, almost making it to the doors before they swung wide open to reveal an array of rifle barrels and knives, and the grim men and women wielding them. Desperate shouts and cries erupted in an instant, as the armed intruders stormed inside and immediately rushed to positions to prevent people from fleeing, warning shots cracking upwards into the air and splintering the ceiling above. Pentti gazed aghast as two armed men in the same charcoal black uniforms and peculiar triangle marked armbands they all seemed to wear burst onto the balcony where he and other observers were watching in terror. \"On your knees! Hands in the air!\" one of the men bellowed, raising his rifle to Pentti's chest.\n\nThe initial panic and stampede of council members had been corralled, replaced with a momentous silence, occasionally punctuated by frenzied whispers, as the most peculiar spectacle made its way into the parliamentary hall. Sitting astride a beautiful mare of mottled grey and brown, Edith Sodergan entered the halls of power with an ethereal grace, clad in a dark dress that matched the uniforms of her militia, a burgundy rose nestled in her bonnet. Trotting towards the speaker's chair, Sodergan dismounted in a flourish and turned to face her stunned audience. At last, she spoke. \"Cowards and sycophants, that is what I see before me.  I shall not mince my words, you have failed Finland and her future. Afforded the chance that generations would throw themselves into oblivion for, and what have you done? Quibbled about the niceties of social democracy while the wolves howl outside your door? Striving to emulate the German pigs breakfast of a government?\" As she carried on her scathing criticism, several members began to loudly protest only to be clubbed down by Futurist gunmen eager to listen to Sodergan's proclamation. She continued: \"To save Finland, something truly prophetic, more vital and hot-blooded than this impotent attempt at evolution is needed. A Second Revolution. One not bound by the chains of useless political theory to an underdeveloped proletariat. One not bound by the feckless and weak-willed fools that would keep stumbling blind within the dark halls of reaction. One, where at last, the strongest spirits might bask in the sunlight they deserve!\", she howled with finality as the rifles fired upwards in applause."

For him, it was always nothing short of a great culinary annoyance, with whatever enjoyment of the tender meat he could have had lost in the monotone process of constantly checking for tiny pieces of bone fitted through the whole thing. As he hurled one of them out of his throat, smearing it inside a sludge composed of his blood, a chunk of fish meat, and saliva, he was fully ready to be reprimanded for wasting food by one of his coworkers. What happened instead was a jovial, almost sentimental message. Karjalainen, one of the young sprouts barely young enough to remember the big war, burst into the makeshift canteen, a newspaper firmly raised in hand.\n\n“We finally have elections, boys! REAL elections. Like those in Berlin, not Kolchak’s! No more Mrs. Carrot vs. Mr. Police Batton!

Did you know that in Germany-” A coworker interjected into Ainos nihilistic rant, only to be immediately spoken over in turn.\n\n“In Germany, death rules! Le Patron will crush all those good for nothing wussies with STEEL and POWER. Like Piłsudski did with all the Russian lickspittles in his country.” The obese lineman took a deep breath as he slammed his fist onto the table, beet red in the face. “Ruutu will free us of them! All of them! The Russians, the Jews, the Capitalists, even the Swedes! Finland will be free and prosperous once we give SANATIONISM a chance. S-A-N-A-T-I-ON. National cleansing of the pests!”\n\n“Like hell he will! I don't want my son to get pestered because his hat isn't ‘fast’ enough or whatever those freaks want from us normal people!” The Sirola supporter objected, pushing his glasses up. Immediately, his compatriot lifted him by the collar, and a force of four men swarmed around to prevent the inevitable table slam. A full-blown fistfight broke out.\n\nAino could only smile, rolling the leftover fish onto the table and hitting whichever unlucky sod stood nearby with the plate.

Beneath them, nationalists, accelerationists and all sorts of utopians fight for influence, hoping to turn the revolutionary tide in their direction.\n\nTwo groups in particular have not picked a side yet, the Radical Party and the theosophist Finnish Labour Party. The former is a liberal movement which rejected participation in the former Grand Duchy's Senate. The latter represents a unique form of utopian progressivism espousing the ideals of the late Lev Tolstoy. Both factions rejected violence against the Russian occupation, preferring to practice peaceful resistance through the formation of loyal communes and unions throughout Finland.\n\nYrjo Sirola, the Social Democrats' and Free Finland's leader, has to make a though choice about these groups. On one side, the Revolution needs all the support in can get in the fight against the White armies, on the other, aligning with these heterodox movements would anger the ideological hardliners within the party. But these are hard times, when compromises have to be made in order to ensure the socialist victory. The newborn regime must find allies in order to stabilise itself, lest it fall in the hands of other movements or, even worse, to Reaction itself. It is up to Yrjo Sirola to decide the best path to victory."

Altti could finally enforce the safety measures which had previously been outside his purview, while Harri had been elected to head his local sawmill after the previous owner was removed. These two men might appear to be allies.\n\n\"There is no way my men can follow all these protocols. You would have us slow down our production by 30% at least, if not more.\"\n\nBut they were not allies, and they were both promised two very different things by the revolution. For Altti, the revolution heralded a bright and clean future. A future where the capitalist class would no longer destroy the health of the nation for profit. For Harri, the revolution meant freedom for workers. Freedom from bosses and managers who stole their wealth and controlled their lives.\n\n\"I'm sorry you feel that way but this is not a request, it is an order.

Effective construction had a distinct smell, a mixture of metals and sweat and fire that foreshadowed the perfect efficiency of a completed factory.  Supervising construction in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio, he would frequently allow his nose to be the final judge on many decisions.  Of course, the climate of the Midwest was far more conducive to his sinuses than Finland’s own, where the compacted fragrance of decaying spruce and melted snow would overwhelm the aromatic nuances of his own projects.  Nonetheless, he had been slowly acclimatizing, building a cartography of odors to grasp what he needed, it was coming to him in time.\n\nWhen he had been dispatched to Finland - a place which, even if someone had put a gun to his head, he would not have been able to point to on a map - an immediate dread had bloomed inside him.  A child of Alabama, the Midwestern winters would exert an almost paralytic effect on him, when the company representative indicated the vast polar expanse to which he was going to be spending the next four months it just about sent him to paroxysm.  But Logan was a company man first and foremost, a man to whom Henry Ford ranked second only to his own family in terms of importance, and he kissed his wife goodbye, took one last gulp of American air, and set off towards the bitter north; and when he arrived in Helsinki seemed to signal that his corporate fidelity had engendered a sort of cosmic luck towards him.  Winter was just about turning to spring, a comfortable, temperate, sun was transmuting the snow to a glittering slush.  It was only as he began to go further north, towards the actual construction site in Kainuu that he felt a disorientation begin to encroach on his sense, less concrete points of references, more phenomena - mostly smells - that lacked any concrete American analogue.\n\nThe people had also been an obstacle to his comfort, everyone on the worksite seemed a recluse, suspicious towards him until they learned who he worked for, at which point they would hurl a shrapnel grenade of broken English at him about how Henry Ford was one of greatest Communists in history - which would then send Logan’s stalwart Republican stomach into somersaults.  The repeated praise of Ford almost made him wonder whether the whole Communism thing in Finland was more of a practical joke than anything else.  With the exception of the occasional poster displaying a smiling group of Finnish workers shadowed by a red flag and a meticulous insistence on the implementation of safety standards, there was very little to reinforce the consistent praise he was receiving that he was playing a crucial role in building Finland’s socialist future.  But it was all affectionate, deeply affectionate, even, and as he opened his eyes to watch the scuttling of construction workers he could not help but feel a sting of pride for a country he still knew nothing of and an ideology he held no sympathy for."

Now, onto the business of our production review.  Comrade Reinikka, if you will give us the pleasure of starting us off with your review of our agricultural situation.”\n\n“Yes, yes, thank you, Comrade.  As many of you are aware, I have recently been deployed to Germany for some time to observe their own methods of planning and hopefully, to the best of my ability, replicate them on our own shores.  Looking over our current figures here… I can definitely see that we’re traveling down the right track… Cattle numbers could perhaps use some adjustments… grain is doing well… of course, all of this has yet to account for the necessary adjustments for mayonnaise, however-”\n\n“Excuse me, Comrade.

The Russians have left for now, but only because their country is fighting with itself. Nobody doubted that once reunited, Moscow would come to reclaim what it saw as its rightful property.\n\nWhen that day would come, Paavolanien thought, they would drown in their own blood.

Every aspect of training made it obvious: taming the steel beasts, undertaking fast maneuvers, embracing the future.

He felt the speed and power that the Finnish man craved for so long, and now he was able to finally grasp it.\n\nTogether with the attending generals, Finland's Apollo turned into Finland's Mars. Soldiers' performance, the state of military inventory, manning and expanding defensive lines across the borders with the reactionary pests surrounding them, Paavolanien weighed on them all. In spite of his love for speed, he listened to what they had to say. But after listening to them, he could discern their lack of vision. These men, he knew, lacked the revolutionary insights which he and Edith Sodergran possessed. How much time has passed since the Revolution? And how many Finns are yet to embrace its prophecies? Judging by his current company, the numbers could be nauseating. He had to take action, the revolutionary struggle was to be won on all fronts. That included military meetings.\n\n\"Stop, STOP!\", screamed Paavolanien. All generals turned their gazes towards him and froze in place. \"Your bickering over these plans, it sickens me! How dare you lead the Army of Revolutionary Finland, when you don't even know the road that you must race towards! The people, the soldiers, are tired of the romanticism of yore, of the realism that obscures their view. When it comes to the military, it must be your age that blinds you! Look at the young soldiers! Look at their leaps! At their vitality and strength! If you can't join them, you must be done away with!\"\n\nThe commanders had no immediate reaction.

As the horse with the procession climbed to the hill, she strode towards it with the same supernatural grace she was never seen without.\n\nThey met at the altar: the animal was flawless, as if stolen from the stables of Helios himself, it was the perfect vessel for that universal will which binds all. And it finally came the time for it to realise its own power to the fullest, to become another orgasmic spasm of the world. Sodergran embraced the stallion gently, hugging it like an old lover.

On the call of the Social Democratic party, the leaders of the main revolutionary factions, Yrjo Ruutu’s National Socialist Union, the republican Radical Party and the religious socialist Finnish Workers’ Party as well as representatives of unions and councils, are to meet together and organise an intermediate parliament for the Finnish republic: the All-People’s Congress, and elect a government of allied democratic parties able to steer the revolution to victory. If any of the parties refuses to collaborate, the consequences might be dire, as dangerous extremists lurk on the periphery of the revolution: if democracy won’t be secured, then a new tyranny might arise in its place."

It is an unfortunate fact that wherever the Red flag flies, beneath it chitter the hive minded bureaucratic class, tempting the proletariat with a swan song of throwing off their fetters only to see stronger, tighter manacles affixed, often by the very bourgeoise which the Socialists lambasted. The “Peoples Congress” was this impulse exemplified; it hid away the ballot box while allowing German and Polish administrators to run the country to a degree that even the Russians never attempted.\n\nYet their crimes were not limited to the material realm, in fact, their most grievous were in the world of spirit and ideals. There was no free press, all councils not of the narrow mould prescribed by “pragmatism” were outlawed, and all innovative minds were expected to answer to narrow-minded bureaucrats. Their rule has fallen, in its stead rises a society of free thinking, forward facing men, who do not fear to expand the revolution into the realm of culture nor undermine the orthodoxies of Marxism."

With the help of Ilmari Kianto and his ‘Bloodhounds’, the paramilitary cells which have been invaluable in securing the revolution, and acclaimed for their ruthless methods, the ultra-revolutionary coalition will rid the new Finland of everything white, red, or under the banner of any other color that seeks to drape itself over all of us.

Cathartic, liberatory violence. And no restraint should be taken when using this most sublime instrument; that would defeat the purpose entirely.

It should be self-evident to remove the degenerate and the feeble, the beggars, criminals and cretins living only on the mercy of Christian morality as it should be to liberate the greatest, to support the progressive edge of science unravelling the mysteries of the human body and to turn the cities into spaces that would allow to freely express vitality.

For love was reduced to a distant singularity, a nothing, as the fiery reality of love was called, at best “lesser”, at worst “sinful”. It is then our duty to liberate love from the chains that weighed on it for millennia. We should begin by abolishing the restrictions on marriage: making all unions between any number of people of any sex equal.\n\nWe ceaselessly fight against all prudery, against the notion that sex should be taken out of the totality of human existence. Free love not only frees the expression of those thus far chained by morality but provides many benefits to the race – allowing the best to spread their genes widely. For this reason the State should also organise and finance the facilities for the collective rearing of children as well as standardise the practice of abortion in hospitals, so that society can take this burden from those that wished to adventure outside their marriage."

On one side, there is the dark, mediaeval Romanticism: born from the imposing towers of Gothic cathedrals, the thick, barbaric walls of Germanic castles and the mystical convulsions of Oriental religion. On the other: the clarity of Classicism, of harmonious arches which perfection wise men have carefully measured and calculated, of the dignified principles of Plato and Aristotle, of self-evident laws of reason, of contemplative, stoic happiness.\n\nThe nineteenth century seemed to be a victory for Classicism. The superstitious laws of feudalism were replaced with the reasoned principles of republics and constitutions, the daughter of reason, science, proved its supremacy over nature. The romantics had to retreat to the realm of the arts, now isolated from the totality of life, turning themselves into decadent observers and nostalgic conservatives.\n\nYet, at the cusp of the twentieth century, a miracle happened. Classicism was beginning to turn against itself. The theories of Schrodinger and Einstein put the sacred principles of identity into question, new inventions have created a strange world, which continues to slip out of our hands. Technics transfigure reality into new, alien shapes, the images of visions and dreams. This new century was inaugurated by a sacrifice: the Great War, in which man and machine lay together in a grotesque orgy of blood and gore and of oil and steel. A new, unprecedented era begins: the era of Modernism, at the same time both Classicism and Romanticism, but truly neither, the age of the Overman.\n\nOne can either flee from this reality, or jump straight into its chaos: and we decide for the latter.

Our story in this time has nothing but the bright words of martyrs to enliven it, naught but the hope of past generations to innervate us.\n\nThe last page, which we write with our lives, tells a story of a revolution that threw off the shackles, giving the power back to the Finnish people. Our Government is so far but a footnote, our plans and programs merely a passing phrase. Our era is one of hope, but it is nascent and weak-footed.\n\nOur language is still spoken with stumblings, our flag is still bright with the colors of days not long past. Our government, with all of its ministries and ministers, has yet to encounter a true test of its mettle. Yet with the whole people behind it, our entire nation will be dedicated to one common cause, our independence will stand the test of time, and the ages tell of our success."
 FIR_light_socdem:0 "The Light of Social Democracy"
 FIR_light_socdem_desc:0 "Finland has not long been free, but in its haste to pull itself into the ranks of the civilized nations, to create a truly Progressive and Democratic state, it has vaunted the Social Democratic Party to victory. Long a voice against the Russian autocracy, and strident advocates for the proletariat, the Social Democrats promise swift development of the nation and fruitful cooperation with our German friends in economic and political matters.\n\nWhile many take the party’s victory as a sign that Finland has merely traded one master for another, the bulk of the people understand that the party’s policies: land reform, workplace democracy, nationalization, and the empowerment of councils is the surest route to prosperity for the only recently liberated nation. While the road may be steep, and studded with obstacles, it shall be traversed, by the people’s will."
 FIR_republic_councils:0 "A Republic of Councils"
 FIR_republic_councils_desc:0 "Our new republic must adopt a constitution as quickly as possible if we wish to survive. And, in truth, there is only one option. While some in our coalition have drawn up elaborate plans built on abstract theories, we know better. We are Scientific Socialists, not Utopians. We must study what has worked in order to create the most effective government possible. And what has worked is the Council Idea.\n\nForged in the 1905 Russian Revolution and perfected by Germany in 1919, the Council System is the great innovation of 20th Century Socialism. We would be foolish to not adopt it. Thus, we shall go to every workplace throughout the nation and link them together. By bringing together the economic and political, we can create an indestructible sword to defend ourselves from all who oppose us."
 FIR_power_unions:0 "All Power to the Unions"
 FIR_power_unions_desc:0 "During the Sortovuodet, hundreds of thousands of Finns immigrated to America to avoid the Russian boot. Now, many have returned, armed with experience of the class war in the USA—in particular, an extensive knowledge of Industrial Unionism. In contrast to Europe, where political parties were the main weapon in the class struggle, the American workingman has had to rely almost entirely on workplace organization.\n\nWhile our socialism is scientific, this does not mean we should be dogmatic. Germany is the most successful socialist enterprise on earth but they are not perfect, nor could we copy them perfectly if we tried. We must allow our returning brothers to bring the techniques learned in America to Finland. With their experience, we will have the most disciplined proletariat in all of Europe. "
 FIR_end_property:0 "End Bourgeois Property"
 FIR_end_property_desc:0 "Now that the civil war has ended, it is time to finish the class war in turn. Every factory, every forest, every field—they all must be seized from the capitalist parasites who control them. To a large extent, this is already happening and we salute those who have taken the initiative. However, we must not stop at mere appropriation.\n\nIf every workplace was merely owned by its workers, we would only have recreated the market system. Instead, we must nationalize the whole of our economy and bring it under democratic control. Factory councils will control day to day operations but the entirety of our economy must be controlled by the Central Council if we wish to democratically plan our nation’s output."
 FIR_democratic_economy:0 "Protection of Labour"
 FIR_democratic_economy_desc:0 "It is not enough to seize the machinery of industry without any alterations. The industrial leviathans built by capitalism do not value human life, and thus are extremely dangerous. Not only is this cruel, but it also hurts the productivity of our nation merely for short-term profit. Socialism bears the birthmarks of capitalism so we must take active efforts to wash away these unsafe practices.\n\nThus, we will send inspectors all over the nation to enforce our new labour policies. No one should work more than 40 hours a week unless strictly necessary. No children under 14 should work at all. When an inspector sees an unsafe workplace, they will be deputized to fix it as they see fit. And workers must be pay into insurance to guarantee that if they are injured, they—and their dependents—will be cared for."
 FIR_march_rotfront:0 "March in the Red Front!"
 FIR_march_rotfront_desc:0 "It was in Berlin in 1919 that the first requiem bells for the old order tolled. While the Russians battled domestic Republicans, Finland was offered a brief glimpse of freedom, one which was not forgotten even after the yolk of Tsarist tyranny sunk upon the nation once again. It was in Germany that the light of the revolution flickered on, casting shadows upon our nation that would dance to our occupiers' consternation. When the Kolchakocracy trembled, it was Germany that ferried our leaders home, beginning the revolution that gave the people power.\n\nNow, as German engineers work wonders upon our country’s dilapidated infrastructure, Finnish students study in venerable Universities in Berlin, Leipzig, and Budapest, and our very own Socialist experiment comes into its own, it is time we fully throw ourselves into the International Revolution and join our brothers in arms."
 FIR_guard_orthodoxy:0 "Orthodoxy's Guard"
 FIR_guard_orthodoxy_desc:0 "When we only existed as opposition to the monstrous Russian yoke, it was easy to maintain Orthodoxy to Marxism. But now that we wield the power of the state, we now have new temptations to bring us off course. Bureaucrats brought into the party to administer the state can fall into revisionism, attempting to moderate the revolution to death; while the Revolutionaries which were needed to win the war are just as likely to fall into Adventurism. We must stay the course and not be swayed."
 FIR_red_guard:0 "Red Guards into Red Army"
 FIR_red_guard_desc:0 "Our haphazardly organized militias must be converted into a true Red Army. It is a miracle that such a rapidly mobilized force was able to win a victory for the proletariat, but we must not rely on miracles. Therefore, we will bring all units under a centralized and clearly defined command structure.\n\nHowever, this is not a return to the reactionary armies of old. First, we will ensure the social equality of all soldiers—officers or not. Only in command will they have any privilege whatsoever. Second, officers will be elected by the soldiers themselves with the highest officers being selected by the National Council. No martial caste may be allowed to form: if Finland is to be safe it must be saved by the whole of her people."
 FIR_socialist_voice:0 "The Socialist Voice in Every Home"
 FIR_socialist_voice_desc:0 "The education of the working class is of utmost importance to all true socialist movements. At present this means speeches, newspapers, and pamphlets, but these mediums spread class consciousness quite slowly. We should take advantage of new technology to bring our message to everyone. With a radio in every home, we will be able to directly speak to every worker. With a theater in every town, we will show the masses moving pictures worth a million words. We may even dream of putting a television in every home by 1950!"
 FIR_international_brotherhood:0 "In International Brotherhood"
 FIR_international_brotherhood_desc:0 "While we have freed Finland from the claws of Russian Imperialism, the eagle's talons have left scars. Not only has our productive capacity been damaged by the civil war, we have also lost access to the supply chains in Russia which were integral to our economy.\n\nThe path out of our economic woes cannot be autarkic. Just as socialism must be politically internationalist, so too must it be economically internationalist; for in reality there is no line between politics and economy.\n\nWe must join Germany in the Warsaw Pact as quickly as possible. In exile many of our leaders have seen the benefits which other former Russian subjects have experienced by their membership. Polish and Ukrainian industry have grown through the industrial expertise of Germany. We must do the same; we must forever unshackle ourselves from Russian backwardness; and we must join the economic fraternity of International Socialism."
 FIR_humanism_ethics:0 "Humanism in Ethics"
 FIR_humanism_ethics_desc:0 "Man is the measure of all things. The Old Duchy of Finland derived its legitimacy from religion; we derive our legitimacy from the people of Finland. The old regime could inflict all manner of cruelties on the people because they were not of the people. We cannot follow in their steps. The enemies of our republic are still men, and must be treated as such. We cannot inflict torture, we cannot execute them; we must attempt to rehabilitate them to the best of our abilities. And just as we teach prisoners to better themselves, we must also bring this humanist mindset to teaching the young to better themselves. The old regime inflicted the worst cruelties on the youth; to make a humane people, we must make a humane education system."
 FIR_secularism_religion:0 "Secularism in Religion"
 FIR_secularism_religion_desc:0 "Religion is the opiate of the masses. To achieve socialism, we must uproot the power of the Lutheran and Orthodox Church by sending them firmly into the private sphere. The state cannot afford to be blinded by religious mystery. It must be perfectly secular. The churches which remain must be denied all state legitimacy; they must simply be treated like any other private organization. The religious schools, which filled our children’s heads with lies, must be shuttered. All children will be enlightened by our socialist republic guided by Marxism. Once these dens of reaction are stripped of their ability to blind the youth, they will wither quickly away into nothingness. "
 FIR_communism_goal:0 "Communism in Goal"
 FIR_communism_goal_desc:0 "Under the diktats of Social Democratic theory, a nation must go through a distinct capitalist phase before Socialism, and subsequently, Communism can be made possible. Finland has had a unique developmental experience, long existing at the peripheries of the Russian Empire, its national consciousness long being suppressed by the Tsar, but never having his boot fully upon it. A native bourgeoise did arise, and an industrial proletariat has long been ballooning in the cities, yet most of our nation remains primitive and agrarian.\n\nThe path to Socialism, thus, will be long and hard, fraught with difficulties, but none that are so great as to not be easily overcome with some effort and dedication. We have empowered the people of Finland so that they may aid and guide us in this struggle. Socialism shall be built upon a foundation of Dialectical Materialism, and shall be given shape by the People’s will."
 FIR_under_plan:0 "Under a Common Five Year Plan"
 FIR_under_plan_desc:0 "We have now constructed a state capable of great things, and have in our hands a party with the will to use it. All we need now is a task worthy of both. The party must come together to carefully analyse what is needed over the next five years, and chart a course to achieve it. The worker’s councils will send data for our most eminent economists—trained in the finest German academies—to compile into a general report. With this information, we can create a plan to achieve our common goal: the emancipation of labour, and freedom for the Finnish nation."
 FIR_break_landowners:0 "Break the Landowners"
 FIR_break_landowners_desc:0 "Our collectivization efforts have been mostly successful, yet there is still work to be done. While the cities have been almost entirely freed of the bourgeois parasites, the countryside is filled with those who assert their ancient rights. Aristocrats, Laukkuryssäs, and large Landholders plague us like locusts. If we wish to liberate the countryside then they must be washed away. Local municipalities will mercilessly expropriate their ill-gotten property, and then lease out this land to cooperative enterprises of landless individuals."
 FIR_mechanisation:0 "Mechanisation and Electrification"
 FIR_mechanisation_desc:0 "It is all well and good to redistribute our nation's soil and earthly bounty from the few to the many, but it would be wrong to stop there. We must change not only the producers of food, but also the production of food. We must electrify, mechanize, and modernize rural life if we wish for the increase in living standards brought on by the revolution to be sustained."
 FIR_cooperative:0 "Cooperative Agriculture is the Future!"
 FIR_cooperative_desc:0 "We are not reactionaries! Many hear our programme which calls to annihilate the large landholders and misunderstand us as wishing to return to a pastoral ideal. We do not wish such things! Small farms perished off the face of the earth for a reason and we will not artificially prop them up. The large farm is the inevitable result of modern agricultural techniques. We will continue this task, but in its final—most realized—form. Small peasants will be given incentives to voluntarily join large farming cooperatives. As the smaller producers see the glory of modern technique, stripped of its malicious capitalist attire, he will inevitably decide to abandon his backward ways."
 FIR_develop_means:0 "Rationalization Renaissance"
 FIR_develop_means_desc:0 "With the 5 year plan crafted, we now must fulfill it. While we obviously intend to create new firms, fields, and factories, it would be foolish to not start with fundamentals. Much of the economy built under capitalism was dedicated to irrational competition and capricious displays of power. We can do better. While most of the yes-men and goons have fled with their bourgeois owners, some have merely adopted socialist slogans while continuing their parasitism. We shall conduct a campaign to clean up inefficient supply lines, and another to audit workplaces to discover the men who sit idly while collecting checks. He who does not work shall not eat."
 FIR_new_standard:0 "A New Living Standard"
 FIR_new_standard_desc:0 "The greatest asset a nation has is its people. Naturally, it only makes sense to invest in them before anything else. While socialism will accomplish this with time, we do not want to wait. Yes, workers no longer have a capitalist over them to siphon profit from them—but even with this pay-raise our living standard isn’t rising fast enough. It is thus up to the state to rectify this. Heating networks will be expanded, houses will be made nicer, and parents shall receive a generous stipend. Not only will this help our growth, it is also what the Finns deserve."
 FIR_american_methods:0 "American Methods, Socialist Goals"
 FIR_american_methods_desc:0 "“The coming system of socialist production will not be the sequel to ancient communism; it will be the sequel to the capitalist system of production, which itself develops the elements that are requisite for the organization of its successor.” —Karl Kautsky\n\nThe wise words of Karl Kautsky remind us that socialist production has much in common with capitalist production. We see this clearly in America, where the final death pangs of capitalism have produced truly remarkable innovations in production—most notably the scientific management of Frederick Winslow Taylor. It would be foolish and primitive to ignore such advancements simply because of their source. We shall therefore import economists and textbooks from the United States to help us implement these exciting techniques into our factories."
 FIR_workers_cause:0 "For the Workers' Cause"
 FIR_workers_cause_desc:0 "Now that social democratic rule has been cemented in our nation, we can proudly stand with the whole socialist world. We are the furthest northern outpost of the working class’ might, and we are an outpost under siege by the worst developments in capitalism and reaction. Yet we do not see this as a curse but rather a blessing. For all time, our nation will be remembered as the torchbearers of communism in the coldest depths of reaction. We shall be exalted and remembered in glory on the future red earth."

 FIR_crows_of_war_desc:0 "Though we may have won our initial onslaught with the forces of Reaction, we are still surrounded by imperialist menaces with far greater military capabilities than us. Finland is a weak state, unaccustomed to modern methods of war and when we do find ourselves in the next battle to preserve our Socialist system and national identity we will surely be crushed if we do not significantly increase our fighting capabilities. Finland must study the tactics of the great powers and – as we will never be able to meet them head on – develop ingenious countermeasures to rout any possible violation of our sovereignty."

 FIR_elected_officers_desc:0 "Democracy must be present everywhere, including the military. The army is a part of our revolutionary democratic state, it’s obvious that it must embrace a new structure fit for its new purpose. Officers formed an oppressive class that commanded the proletarian soldiers to their deaths. Not anymore! The soldiers themselves will now elect officers of their own. These officers will be loyal to their troops, to the revolutionary cause, and make decisions that will not send our units into a carnage."
 FIR_army_of_labour:0 "Army of Labour"
 FIR_army_of_labour_desc:0 "Industry needs military discipline to properly develop in Finland. The modern worker is the soldier waging war on the production front. His weapon, the hammer, and his foe, raw steel. In times of peace, our soldiers must keep their discipline in shape. He can do that on the construction fields that are engulfing our nation, offering direly needed help to our workforce while sharpening his dedication to his country."

 FIR_free_finlands_army_desc:0 "The war of national liberation has shown the futility of radical ideas such as soldiers’ councils. The command has been able to end the anarchy they instilled in our troops with emergency measures, but now it’s time to turn it permanent. The army is not a place to toy with dangerous ideas, traditional hierarchy will be enforced. "
 FIR_peoples_militia:0 "A People's Militia"
 FIR_peoples_militia_desc:0 "We must struggle against the sins of bourgeois armies. The army is not a profession or a job, it’s the duty of all proletarians. By keeping its ranks sealed from the common world, counter-revolution fosters a safe environment for its actions. We will prevent this from happening here by returning military service to the people. Each worker must be able to take up to defend his country and his rights, with weapons in hand if the need arises. Our reactionary force will be turned into a militia of the revolutionary masses, the only ones fit for such a task."
 FIR_towards_mobilisation:0 "Towards Mobilisation"
 FIR_towards_mobilisation_desc:0 "Finland is a great country but with a small population. In the age of industry, we can use the power of machines to overcome the difference in fielded soldiers against our enemies.

All of Finland is rising to defend its freedom."
