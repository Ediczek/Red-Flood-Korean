 NRO.1.desc:0 "\"Gentlemen, we need to discuss an issue that is important for the future of our country,\" Began the king, \"Our already unenviable position has deteriorated sharply with the recent unrest, and I, frankly, won't want to wait until a wall has grown between us and the north-west, dividing Norway for decades. Given our situation, I must insist on an increase of the military budget for the restoration of legal order throughout the kingdom.\"\n\nThe Storting perked up noticeably, eyes glancing at each other, some with surprise, some with bewilderment.\n\n\"Your Highness, I will allow myself to point out that we cannot simply increase the military budget for the sake of some adventure. We have a mandate from the voters, who express no strong desire to experience fresh turmoil, given the precariousness of our internal affairs,\" said Speaker Hambro, his backbenchers murmuring affirmatively behind him.\n\n\"I perfectly understand your concerns, but fail to consider that there are forces that can help us regain possession of the kingdom. A patrimony that belongs to me, my family and the people of Norway. We cannot afford to wait until we lose what little we have left,\" said the king.\n\n\"And I believe that you cannot pass a budget bypassing parliament. We may argue forever, but the days of the Øresundstolden are gone. The people have their own voice.\" - said Hambro, clearly firm in his position.\n\n\"Therefore, I am bringing the following question to a vote - should we increase the military budget? Please, gentlemen, who votes for \"aye\"?\"\n\nAbout seven people raised their hands. There was silence in the hall.\n\n\"Who votes for \"nay\"?\"\n\nA show of hands rose up.\n\n\"According to the results of the vote, the military budget will not increase. Thank you for your attention.\""

 NRO_patience:0 "Our Waning Patience"
 NRO_patience_desc:0 "The Swedes may shed endless tears about the great brotherhood between themselves and the Norwegian, they may offer an infinite number of saccharine toasts to the noble loyalty of Norway to the Birkeneid; it does very little to change the fact that our continued alliance with Stockholm is one continued solely out of convenience.  We tolerate a Swede on our throne and the Swedish military in our streets, because Sweden remains the best security we have against the red tumor to our West.\n\nOr so it was the prevailing opinion for quite some time.  In recent years, the silence from our supposed protectors has been a continual source of emotions ranging from chagrin to infuriation across our society, emotions which have begun to crystallize into vocal doubts about Sweden’s capacity to fulfill its role as our guardian.  As the air grows ever thicker, augering our inexorable careen towards a confrontation with the Red scum, the time is nearing when Sweden will have to prove that it has earned our loyalty."
 NRO_league:0 "The Fedrelandslaget… And What Lies Below"
 NRO_league_desc:0 "The politics of the Kingdom of Norway are, by design, dominated almost uniformly by the Fedrelandslaget, enjoying an overpowering influence in the Storting, on the courts, in the military, and, of course, occupying the prime ministership.  The absolute hegemony of the FL over the political institutions of Norway, and their adamant refusal to even consider the possibility of relinquishing it, has seemingly shrunk the horizons of political possibility in the country to such an extent as to be a de facto dictatorship of a single party; with the NS acting as a bulwark against any disruptive forces which may jeopardize the already fragile stability of the Norwegian Kingdom.\n\nPolitics, however, remains merely a dim reflection of actual power.  Outside the boundaries of the government and its institutions, the grip of the Fedrelandslaget on Norwegian society is far more tenuous, with a cacophony of different voices questioning the value of their continued rule and proposing a range of alternatives stretching to the farthest reaches of acceptable thought.  While it would be tempting to have these dissenting currents forcibly suppressed; the fact is that declaring an open war may make our position even more precarious, and as of right now they have yet to find one particular moment to seize on in order to justify making their own move.  Even within the FL, the facade of unified power has begun to fragment, with Storting President Vidkun Quisling making increasingly flagrant public attacks on Prime Minister Hjort.  Amidst all this, the general climate has begun to creep towards one of uncertainty, an inevitable realization that somewhere, in the distance, change is coming for better or worse."
 NRO_norge:0 "Norge Vårt Land, Du Hvis Fremtid Er Vår!"
 NRO_norge_desc:0 "It was not even two decades that we tasted independence before the Judeo-Spartakist dogs and their Rotfront handlers tried to subjugate us to Berlin.  While we managed, with considerable sacrifices in blood and sovereignty, to fight them off with Swedish assistance, our lack of a decisive victory, with the freezing of the conflict in 1925, has loomed over us for the past decade.\n\nYet, it cannot be denied that the intervening years have seen a gradual thawing; increasingly aggressive army exercises along the border, disappearances in the mountains, enemy planes flying overhead, it is becoming apparent to all involved that we are marching towards a final confrontation to decide our national future.  What the Socialists don’t know is that when the time comes, we will stand ready, we will march over the mountains and into the streets of Bergen to drive the rats from their nest.  Yes, Norway will be unified soon, but not as a pawn of red internationalism, but as a glorious nation in its own right."
 NRO_nothing:0 "Nothing Below Us"
 NRO_nothing_desc:0 "When the Socialist dogs, in a frenzy of bloodlust, unleashed themselves on Vestfold, it was due to the leadership of Johan Bernhard Hjort that they were swiftly scattered back to their den in Bergen.  The Norwegian people owe him a great debt for his steadfast service, and it can begin repaying it by vesting him with the total control he needs to restore Norways to peace, stability, and glory.  Gone are Quisling and his pathetic band of impulsive rabble rousers in the Storting, the tawdry bands of naysayers who crowed at him from the mountains have now been rendered stupified by his miraculous aptitude under fire.  Norway is the Fedrelandslaget, and the Fedrelandslaget is Johan Bernhardt Hjort."
 NRO_vikingtog:0 "Pa Vikingtog!"
 NRO_vikingtog_desc:0 "We have survived the perfidious attempts by the Socialists to cleave open the wounds of war, but the incident has revealed the tremendous rot within the government.  Hjort, our supposed “protector,” has spent his years dithering away on flights on political uselessness, all while our enemy armed itself and prepared to deal a killing blow.  Such a sorry state has been put to an end by the coup of Vidkun Quisling.  The sclerotic husk of the Hjort government shall be stripped away, replaced by a martial climate exhumed from the souls of our viking ancestors, a total orientation of society towards the defense of the Norwegian people and the vanquishing of our Socialist enemies.  When Quisling speaks, Bergen and Berlin tremble; and when Quisling acts, they will shatter."
 NRO_growth:0 "Growth Of Soil"
 NRO_growth_desc:0 "While we were thankfully able to turn back the Red tide at Vestfold, that such an attack was even able to occur has put a stake in the confidence of our people.  The remedy to this recent disease lies in return.  The Norwegian people must return to the warm embrace of both their own nation and the arms of their Germanic brothers in the Birkeneid if they are to survive the unfolding cataclysm of modernity, and leading them in this return shall be their prophet.  Elderly and deaf, but far from senile, Knut Hamsun shall lead the Norwegian people back to the wellspring of their own soil, from which the seeds of renewal shall be planted and the Norwegian race shall grow once more to greatness."
 NRO_law:0 "The Law of Mortal Danger"
 NRO_law_desc:0 "Combat has come to test our people, and it is a test we have failed.  Yet, this failure may ultimately be the greatest gift delivered to the Nordic race in recent memories, as once more we have been plunged into the vitalizing and regenerative crucible of brutality by which all great races forge themselves.  It is time to embrace the dangers that life hurls towards us, to denude ourselves of cowardice and the maternal, smothering protection of Stockholm.  The Norwegian race takes a deep breath now, preparing itself for the plunge into beautiful carnage."
 NRO_window:0 "A Window To The Spring"
 NRO_window_desc:0 "Humiliation has descended upon as a strike from a cold mallet, its blow awakening us from the sterile soporific lull of bourgeois materialism.  In its place the virile flower of Norwegian youth will eventually come to bloom, yet for now our attention must turn immolating from the Norwegian soul all the mechanistic and ossified clutter which stems the flow of raw life through our people.  One day, beneath the piercing gaze of the Sun, our nude bodies shall come to writhe in a raw vortex of vital power, a great conduit of erotic divinity that shall be pointed against this ravaged world like a weapon, cutting through its repressive weight and unleashing the beautiful excesses of flesh and spirit from its open wounds."
 NRO_messiah:0 "The Last Messiah"
 NRO_messiah_desc:0 "Our defeat at Vestfold has left many in a state of shock, clamoring for answers as to how such a thing could happen, how such a tragedy could spring up so suddenly from the abyss.  But answers shall not be found.  The past decades of violence has taken its toll upon the consciousness of all mankind, and its immiserating effects have yielded a particularly concentrated cruelty in Norway.  While we have spent much time debating and killing over questions which, at bottom, entail the best way to mitigate the inherent misery of being human, it is dawning on the people of the frigid North that nothing less than the complete extinction of our species will remedy the pestilent sting of conscious existence.  This is, for many people, a path too unbearable to consider, much less follow, but there are those who wish to travel it, and Peter Wessell Zapffe shall be their shepherd."
