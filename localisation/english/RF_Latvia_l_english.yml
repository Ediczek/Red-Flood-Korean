LAT_tale_desc:0 "하늘을 보라! 저 높은 하늘을 보라. 어찌 보지 못하는가, 동무들아? 오랜 신들께서 다시 태어나셨거늘! 페르쿠나스께서 죽음에서 일어나시니, 웅살자가 되살아났도다!\n\nA new Leader presides over our nation, and together with the 백수리, 리투아니아의 기수, 우크라이나의 천사, they have struck down the Bear-Slayer who had plagued us for long millennia. Ernests Brastiņš has cleansed our nation of the Christian plague and strengthened it with the Commandments of Power. There is no evil in the world, brothers. There is only good, because the world is good. It is blessed by Dievs! He looks down on us and on our attempts to civilize the peasants graciously from his luminous home in the high sky. Brastiņš 만세! 우리는 그분의 편에 서서 싸울 준비가 됐습니다. 인테르마리움의 도움에 힘입어, 우리는 게르만화와 러시아스러움이라는 작은 라트비아인들의 병을 치료할 수 있게 될 것입니다. \n\n발트에서는 새로운 라트비아의 질서가 떠오르고 있습니다. 안타까운 일이지만, 어째서인지 인테르마리움은 에스토니아인들을 되살리고 찢겨 나간 러시아가 살아 있게 놔두도록 정했습니다. 우리는 아리아 형제들이 이 실수를 언제든 바로잡을 수 있도록 설득할 것입니다. Ugunskrusts는 더 높이 자랑스레 날아오르고야 말 것입니다... 언젠간 말이죠."

LAT_roaring_thunder_desc:0 "Our new nation has emerged, like a thunder cloud rolling over the raging sea. And as we take the stage in the European theater, our battle cry shall ring out more loudly than a clap of thunder, and our might shall be shown more brightly than a flash of lightning. We shall not whimper, nor cower in the face of our supposedly superior enemies. We shall not shrink from the danger which now envelopes our lands and our people. We shall stand, we shall fight, and we shall roar, for we are Latvia, and we are thunder!"
LAT_expel_russians:0 "러시아인 추방"
LAT_expel_russians_desc:0 "Russians and their incessant need to invade and imperialise those bordering them have been a blight on the baltic since time immemorial, but no longer! Everyone with a Russian surname will be shown the border, this is no longer their land to abuse as they please, Latvia for Latvians!"
LAT_rooting_out_germans:0 "독일인 소거"
LAT_rooting_out_germans_desc:0 "Russians are only half of the cancer that is afflicting the Baltic, the Baltic Germans are age old oppressors who hoarded gold and lived in opulence off the beaten and broken backs of the Balts who rightfully worked for it. We will seize their holdings, their property, and exile those who raise a word of complaint."
LAT_getting_grip_on_education:0 "교육 분야 장악"
LAT_getting_grip_on_education_desc:0 "Our education system is, quite frankly, a shambles. One village teaches a different set of lessons to one not a few miles away, and universities are stacked with outdated books and instruments. We should therefore establish a centralised curriculum and require all educational establishments to adhere to it, print new textbooks in our language, and source new instruments of teaching and research."
LAT_burn_down_churches_and_cathedrals:0 "교회와 대성당을 불사르다"
LAT_burn_down_churches_and_cathedrals_desc:0 "The only church which enlightens is a burning one, as their outdated and backwards teachings served only to tighten the shackles around us, and ensure our happiness in slavery. No more disingenuous preachers poisoning our minds, no more tithes and no more lies! Every last one of these establishments shall be torn down, and something useful built in their place!"
LAT_found_vef:0 "VEF 설립"
LAT_found_vef_desc:0 "The VEF, or Valsts Elektrotehniskā Fabrika (State Electrotechnical Factory), is a concept for a facility designed specifically for experimenting with and manufacturing electronics. What better way to harness the power of the gods than by using lightning to power our society?"
LAT_expand_riga_shipyards:0 "리가 선착장 확충"
LAT_expand_riga_shipyards_desc:0 "RIga is both our national capital and our main point of access to the Baltic Sea. As such, we should revitalize the city's naval industry in order to both increase production and show our enemies that, although our nation is small for the moment, we shall not cede control of the Baltic Sea to anyone."

LAT_modern_agriculture_desc:0 "Owing to our time under the boot of the Russians, our agricultural methods are sorely out of date. It is long past time that we began modernizing our agriculture so that we can launch headfirst into the 20th century."
LAT_prepare_for_industrialization_desc:0 "Latvia is, unfortunately, not a country in a strong economic position. Though some development and progress was made during the Stolypin years, the subsequent Great War, civil war, and stagnation of our former Russian overlords made us suffer much. We shall not look back on the rustic and stagnant times before us, for now is the time to march onwards to a new era of progress and development! Where there once road horses and carriages, trains will zoom from city to city! Where there once was oil lamps and candles, there will be light at a moment's touch! All of this and more, awaits us!"
LAT_form_regular_army_desc:0 "Our struggle for independence against Russian dominance was hard fought and bravely won. But we did not win with a trained professional army. Much of our rank and file came from conscripts and volunteers from the city and villages, many who had never really held a gun before. If we wish to retain our independence, we have no choice but to muster an army like that of the Great Powers. A professional and well-trained military force, not just some rag-tag group of peasants and patriots!"
LAT_get_rid_of_partisan_tactics_desc:0 "Due to the nature of the foe we fought against, it would have been difficult to win in a standard front-line war. As a result, we had to improvise, and utilise guerrilla tactics to drain the morale and supply of our enemy. But should tomorrow bring war, we cannot hope to win with these same tactics. We need new doctrines and methods of combat if we wish to retain our independence. By relieving war-time partisans of commander duty and bringing in new blood for the future, we will ensure a much better chance at keeping our territorial integrity safe."
LAT_develop_new_doctrine_desc:0 "The outlook and tactics of many of our generals have remained by and large the same since the end of the Great War. But the world has greatly changed since then. It is thus necessary that we make room for new thinkers, theories and tacticians suited for the modern world and for a modern war!"
LAT_prepare_army_reforms_desc:0 "It is regrettable but our army still remains in much a sorry state! Our weapons are primarily left overs from the Great War and Russian Civil War. Some of our men do not have easy access to food or provisions. This is no way to treat an army! It is high time we begin preparing for reforms across the board to increase morale and discipline and ensure we have a strong and capable fighting force! "
LAT_polish_question_desc:0 "The Poles have had a legacy in the Baltic region since the times of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, the question now comes before our leadership, how do the Poles fit into our plans for the Baltics? Are the Poles another Baltic people to be united under our banner? Or are they merely our allies in the struggle for defense against Germany and Russia? Only time will tell what our leaders will decide."
LAT_quest_for_baltic_supremacy_desc:0 "Our people have known for a long time that they have a special destiny as opposed to other peoples. Now, the dream of uniting all the Baltic peoples under a single nationalist state has been realized, and now we must seek to secure control over the Baltic homeland from foreign invaders. Not only that, but we must begin planning out our future expansion in order to make our rivals subordinate to our great nation."
LAT_council_for_war_preparations_desc:0 "An ironclad bunker under Riga shall be constructed, in which our generals can scheme with state leaders. Their operations will have the utmost priority and thus their decrees to the private sector shall be law. Our high command is the bow, the people are our arrows with which we will strike true into our enemies' hearts."
LAT_militarize_vef_desc:0 "Let us carry forth the great engine of our country which we have toiled away to construct. This simple factory has evolved to a grand complex that continues to eat the surrounding area and demand the installation of new equipment. It's time to unleash the monster on our enemies. A few new contracts, a handshake, and yet another wing of VEF is formed, as the entire enterprise is sharpened to a point."
LAT_baltic_military_industry_desc:0 "With an eye most harsh we must scour the landscape, seeing nature and homes alike as complications to the birth of our child, victory. Earth shall be sculpted, rivers poured into man-made water features for the steam generators for the power plants that feed our manufacturing. Why? For the war! For victory for our people! Another year without robust rural electricity is a small price for the peasants to pay while we fend off great powers."
LAT_establish_rtk_desc:0 "Higher education is a cornerstone of any advanced society. Our nation must have an educational institution to match the likes of Oxford and Harvard. And ours must reflect the spirit and strength of our new state!"
LAT_nationalize_foreign_businesses_desc:0 "Up until now, we have tolerated foreign business in our lands for the sake of filling our coffers and staving off the ire of our trade-minded neighbours. Now that the Baltics have been united and our reforms are in motion, however, it is time for us to officially bring these businesses under the wing of the state. This will benefit our state, our nation, and our people, not to mention the state budget!"
LAT_integrate_industry_of_conquered_lands_desc:0 "Though we have made vast strides in terms of territorial gain recently, not much has been done in the way of economic integration. This has led to a situation where the vast majority of our people see themselves as mere victims of Latvian occupation, and most of our land is filled with damaged economies and resentful citizens. This simply will not do. We must remind all Balts that we are a united people, and that begins with the reconstruction of conquered factories."
LAT_proclaim_pan_baltic_idea_desc:0 "Whispers of our ambitions have been swirling around in the highest echelons of government for quite some time now, but it is finally the right moment to announce our plans to the world. Let us proclaim ourselves as a Pan-Baltic state, one which envisions all Baltic peoples as one nation, under one state, all with one voice."
LAT_conquest_of_baltic_sea_desc:0 "While we wish we could unite with our Baltic brothers in peace, we realise this is an unrealistic thing to hope for. With our new military-industrial complex constructed and ready, we shall begin preparations for the fulfilment of our territorial ambitions. We shall be the undisputed masters of the Baltics, and no power, no matter how great, shall stand in our way."
LAT_invent_all_baltic_language_desc:0 "How can we claim that our people speak with one voice when, at present, they all speak any combination of Latvian, Estonian, Lithuanian, Russian, German, Polish, Belarussian, and whatever else may seep into our nation through immigrants and other foreign elements. As we have searched for a remedy to these ills, some of our more impatient members of government have suggested that we should merely pick one of our most popular languages and simply make that our official language. However, a counterproposal from the more visionary among us has won out. A new tongue shall be constructed, one that will surpass all supposed ethnic barriers between our fellow Balts. Of course, this will be a very time-consuming endeavour, and it is likely that no one will be pleased with this idea, seeing as it will erase minority and majority languages alike. This is no matter, as anyone who refuses to learn the new language shall be charged with treason and sentenced justly to prison, where their stay can be shortened by taking just a few measly language courses."
LAT_pogroms_against_monotheists_desc:0 "For centuries, Monotheism has been a force which has infested the Baltics with foreign and dangerous ideas about faith. We have already banned Monotheism, a policy which is strictly enforced, and made Baltic Paganism our state religion, but this is not nearly enough. No, if we are to defeat this threat to our people and their beliefs, we must go on the offensive and fight it in the streets. Righteous mobs have already formed across the nation, and now we shall give them an official government sanction of their actions. Let us mark and forever celebrate the beginning of our First Pagan Crusade!"
LAT_thunder_roars_once_again_desc:0 "We have succeeded in securing our national interests and carving out a future for our people. Our enemies lie defeated, writhing in their own dung while we stand as the strongest power in Europe. Now, as we did those years ago when we stepped out into Europe, we shall again step out, this time into the world, so that we might find our place in the sun. That is, until its power, too, is consumed and harnessed by our civilization."
LAT_invent_our_own_doctrine_desc:0 "Over the course of military history, many doctrines have been drawn up detailing the best methods of warfare as dreamt up by various great generals and marshals. None of the famous doctrines of the past century have been made with our people in mind. How can we use German or French military strategy when those soldiers don't even know what a peat bog is, much less how to fight in one? No, today we carve out our own path in order to devise a strategy to surpass even the strongest of armies."
LAT_learn_from_our_ancestors_desc:0 "No one knows our land, our history, our spirit better than our elders. They pass on to us stories and lessons from those who came before us, so that we might survive long enough to pass on some of our own. Great emphasis should be put on learning from the experiences of our ancestors, so that we might carry on their legacy and succeed where they failed."
LAT_karaviru_gods_desc:0 "The values of the old world and eras have withered and died. The idea of God and faith cannot evoke the ideals and meaning we search for in life any longer. In the chaos of the modern world we are entering a crisis and there is a great danger of nihilism consuming us all. In the face of such prospects we have only one option. The spirit of the Old World must be born again! The creation of new values to banish nihilism and the dredges of the modern world. Like the thundering warrior Gods of old myth and legend, we must awaken a new morality and new ideals for a new genesis of the world!"
LAT_perkona_negaiss_desc:0 "Everyday, the Russian Bear eyes us with eternal malice, cursing the very idea of our independence and existence. If we do not begin to prepare for the worst, we will easily be swept aside by its might! So, like the lightning, let us strike at all who seek to take even an inch of our land! Like the thunder, let us proclaim with deafening roars that we will defeat any who stand to take away our freedoms!"
LAT_conference_of_warsaw_desc:0 "The interests of our nation and people are directly intertwined with those of Poland. As leader of the Intermarium, they are our only bulwark against German and Russian aggression, and thus it would be foolish to think that we could survive without them. We should confer with Polish leadership in Warsaw to decide how best to conduct our affairs in the best interest of Poland, and by proxy Eastern Europe."
LAT_polish_doctrine_desc:0 "In Polish military history, there are far too many examples to count of the Polish army, even when outmatched and outnumbered, emerging victorious by taking whatever advantage they can over the enemy. We shall adopt their tactics into our own army, both to increase our military performance, and increase cohesion for the inevitable day where our armies are forced to fight together on the battlefield."
LAT_invite_polish_military_mission_desc:0 "Our army is in dire need of improvement. Our fledgling nation is patrolled by various pro-government militias in place of a standing army, and even the small volunteer force we have amassed is terribly untrained and disorganized. For the sake of our national wellbeing and continued existence, we must humbly ask Poland for the gift of a military mission to properly train our troops and bring pride to our nation."
LAT_atri_ka_zibens_desc:0 "If you cannot catch your enemy, how can you hope to beat them?\nThis is the mantra, the ideal, that we must begin to fuse with our army. If any foreign invader comes to take our land, we will be as fast as lightning and strike just as hard! While the foe slowly inches into our land, we will surround them and outpace them wherever they may be. With this, victory will be no question at all!"
LAT_lithuanian_question_desc:0 "By all traditional definitions, Lithuania is a Baltic nation. It has a Baltic coast, was originally composed of Pagan tribes, and often finds itself at the mercy of Russia and Germany. However, their government has made no attempt at contacting ours, and they seem fairly content, at least for now, to simply operate within the Intermarium. Though this may be true, it is still worth it to at least proposition Lithuania for integration, even if just to know their answer for certain."
LAT_united_in_faith_desc:0 "At the moment, our country is divided between two prominent religious sects: Orthodox and Catholic Christianity. With Latvia and Estonia inheriting the Orthodox faith from Russia, and Lithuanians and Poles having a long and proud history of Catholicism, both belief systems are deeply rooted, and neither side is willing to budge. This is a difficult and unpopular decision, but in order to further integrate into the Polish bloc, we must endorse their majority religion, Catholicism. The Catholic Church in our lands shall receive special privileges, and Catholic values will be instilled via religious education and government propaganda. With enough time, we will be a fully Catholic nation. "
LAT_integration_of_lithuania_desc:0 "At last, our Lithuanian brothers and sisters have come to join us, and the Baltics can now truly be said to be united. Now that this is the case, it is time to set about the task of fully integrating their economy, government, infrastructure, and people. This will be a long and arduous process, but by the end it will have been worth it, for we will finally be able to operate as three nations together in one state with efficiency."
LAT_new_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "As a collection of tiny, disunited states, our lands have rarely ever had much labour productivity. With our low population and lack of industrialization, our economic output is pathetic compared to our neighbours. However, large deposits of industrial materials like coal and iron have recently been unearthed based on evidence of smithing in the iron age. Now not only can we harvest these materials with the assistance of imported machinery, but we can begin building factories to manufacture iron products. Our nation shall finally enter the modern era of industry."
LAT_implement_language_programs_desc:0 "As of now, all of our schools are teaching some combination of Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian, with minor Polish programs popping up in minority enclaves. In order to foster national unity and bring our people closer to our gallant allies in Poland, our schools will teach Polish in addition to their native languages. That way, even two people born and raised in different parts of our federation will have a common language with which to speak to one another."
LAT_extended_rights_for_polish_merchants_desc:0 "Much of our trade and business comes from Polish merchants bringing high-demand civilian and luxury goods to sell at a profit. They have the same rights as other foreign and domestic merchants, and our nation enjoys a slight profit from taxation of these transactions. We can stimulate this kind of business by offering special rights and privileges for specifically Polish merchants, ingratiating them to us and creating additional revenue at the same time."
LAT_polish_funding_desc:0 "While our economy is by no means in danger of crashing, we are certainly lagging in comparison to the rest of the Intermarium. What we need is a stimulus package, a small bit of money to help kickstart an economic revolution here in the Baltics. Let us reap the benefits of friendship and ask the Polish for the money."
LAT_baltic_weapon_manufacturing_desc:0 "Our armament industry is a laughing stock. If we're lucky we might produce a handful of rifles every year, and they're even made with foreign designs. No longer shall we allow ourselves to fall so pitifully behind. Starting now, we will create the most powerful and productive arms economy in the world. "
LAT_industrialize_rural_regions_desc:0 "While much of our land is far too swampy and marshy to industrialise, there are still bits of arable countryside sprinkled throughout our country. While we will leave some room for nature, this open land should be used for industrial development. Otherwise, we are wasting both land and money."
LAT_industrialization_succeeds_desc:0 "At last, our nation is starting to see the benefits of industrialization. Profits are increasing, general standards of living are going up, and in our more wealthy cities, civilian automobiles are becoming more accessible to the average consumer. Let us use these gifts of industry to propel the Baltics into a new age!"
LAT_baltic_beacon_desc:0 "The Baltics used to be a place of darkness and sorrow in Europe, a bastion of foreign occupation and cold, dark days. Now, however, a shining civilization has emerged as an example to other small nations of the world. When it comes to the survival of these nations, the lesson to take from the Baltics is this: There is strength in unity."
