 nbe.1.desc:0 "It was Corporal Albert's birthday, or at least he thought it was. His memory had grown hazy over the years, and in this damn jungle every day, week, and month were the same, blending one into another like evergrowing tendrils.  Corporal Albert took a long look at his face in a shard of a mirror jammed into the wall of his hut, barely recognizing himself. The face belonged to an old man, not that of the youth he saw in the photograph among his documents. When his work in this Hell was done, would his family recognize him? Would they even want to? He considered for a moment shaving himself, staring into the unkempt abomination of stringy hair that covered his lower half of his face, caked in old sweat. He must've been stinking to high hell. He didn't even smell it. Everything here stunk. The soldiers, the workers, the beds. The entire jungle drowned in stench of death. There was no escaping it. They were all reeking of death and decay. Down to the very bones, to the very soul.\n\n \"It's time to unwrap your birthday gift, Corporal.\", Albert said while emotionlessly reaching for his revolver. With a swift, almost mechanical motion he removed bullets from it and put back in only one. \"You were waiting for it entire year, Corporal. I know it's your favorite.\" He continued staring into the old handgun before spinning the cylinder and cocking the hammer. With a heavy sigh, he put the barrel against his temple. A drop of sweat ran from his forehead down his cheek, as the hut was filled with dense, suffocating silence. \n\n Click. \n\n The hammer hit with a quiet clang against the empty chamber, cutting through the silence like a knife. Albert feel to his knees sobbing."

 nbe.2.title:0 "Fall of Elisabethsville"
 nbe.2.desc:0 "Burning mud of sunlight continued to drip slowly from the harsh, naked sky. Merciless rays scorched ground and flesh alike, yet seemed to do nothing to disperse the overwhelming shadows. Even at high noon,  everything drowned in inky black like the blood-shade of a dead man. The shade suffocated and strangled men and plants alike, and offered no refuge from the heat. All the while, enless swarms of mosquitos and flies buzzed at the meat of the carcas-state.\n Now, Elisabethville lay on the horizon, or at least the open camp presently build haphazardly atop the war-hollowed remains of it. The city itself was a living corpse, a skeleton of brick and wood strung together with thick ropes of hopeless stuborness. Men and women lived there like scared rats right under eyes of an exterminator.\n But despite all they lived the best they could. A bored man in a patched hat tried to sell fresh fruits out of a stand. A woman admired herself in a broken mirror, spider web-like surface returning her dozens of brilliant smiles. Children chased after a kicked ball."

 nbe.3.title:0 "I Feel As If Might Be Vanishing"
 nbe.3.desc:0 "Lushiku remembered from his childhood an old white man, his grey beard reaching down to his sunken chest and strange black robes so unfit to the hot climate of the jungle. He remembered his voice, strangely melodic and enticing even if words coming out of his mouth were unpronounceable mess of foreign syllables. He spoke through a villager from another tribe who knew their native tongue rather poorly and most likely barely understood the white man in the first place. But he and others listened to his words anyway, some from curiosity, some counting on gifts he might be bearing, some to kill boredom.\n/Old man spoke of many things, many strange things. Of great god of his people, of his son and of their tribe in the skies. But also of a horrible place where the god cast those who he rejects. A place of darkness and fire, of torment and wickedness. A great furnace where unworthy are thrown to burn for all times for their crimes against him.\nLashiku, now himself an old man was there.\nHe did not remember now how long it was. A lifetime? Many lifetimes? A year? Time made no difference here. There was no Sun, no Moon and no Stars. There was no sky where the god of the old man lived. There was just the endless cave, the stale hot air and strikes of the tools against the stone. He experienced them working, he experienced them eating vile slop feed to him and he experienced them in his sleep. There was no refugee, there was no rest. There was no real light neither. Sun didn't reach the cavernous depths of the Earth's womb where they were stuck, only shaky, murky light of the flame brighten the way. In its hellish glow he could see his hands, like skeletal paws of a nightmare. The faces of his companions, sunken snouts of the dead men who keep on walking forced by leashes and chains.\n\nHe envied the dead and the blind.\nBut those who collapse, their husks spent to the last drop of blood. What happens to those? Do their spirits escape the torment? Do they return to the Sun and the Forest?\n\nHe didn't believe so. Their torment was never-ending, there was no escape even in death. Those who fall only sink deeper into the endless maze of tunnels, the bowels of the monster brought in by the vengeful god. They were to strike the walls over and over again in hunger and exhaustion, in darkness and heat.\nVile speech of the monsters rang in his ears again as the lash hit his back. He must been slogging again..."

 nbe.4.desc:0 "His name was Puk.\nWell, not really, this is how Cruel Masters called him. At first did not dare to speak his real name among them, then he didn't dare to speak it at all. Now he  wasn't even sure he could produce the sounds required to speak the word once serving as his name. But he didn't complain. Not just because he wasn't allowed to or didn't have anyone to complain to. He was someone. Born mangled and frail, maturing without growth... he was to be lowest among the low. Too weak to work, to small to fight. Ugly and despised.\nBut not for the Masters.\nThey took him, lifted him from the mud of his people and made him Puk.\nHe was feed scraps from Master's table. He wore clothes made by Them. He didn't work, he didn't fight. He just existed and that very fact was enough. Masters took strange joy in seeing him walk, try to climb furniture not fit for his size, wear clothes unfit for his body. He was amusing and that made Masters happy.\nOthers didn't made Them happy. They were lazy and ungrateful. They ate food they were given without giving praises, they bad-mouthed Masters behind their backs. This is why they were punished, this is why they suffered. Puk couldn't hide satisfaction seeing haughty giants broken under whips of the Masters. To see their perfect bodies bound and harnessed to do their bidding. To see those arms, those legs, those faces he was denied contorted into forced obedience to Those he was most loyal servant to. He, the lowly Puk might been but a lowly toad, a toy walking like a man but he too was like his Cruel Masters. He didn't dress like those working in the mines, he didn't walk like them, he didn't ate like them, he didn't talk like them. He knew words of Master's tongue, he knew their customs and their desires. When he followed one of Them around the camp prisoners looked at him with hatred of a cornered animal, he returned it with a look of a higher being he learned from his Masters. They were great teachers.\nToday he forced a boot way too big for his feet in front of one of the workers who fell from exhaustion. In a theatrical manner he demanded barely coucious man to kiss it. Masters laughed, their chests shaking and bright teeth flashing. And Puk laughed with them."

This little piece of paper was brought in from the central command itself, supposedly identical copies were now on desks of commanders of local garrisons all over the Congo.\n\"What in the devil could this mean?\"\nHe asked empty space in the room, his only companion for most of his working hours. Emptiness didn't break its habitual silence and gave no response. Letter was neatly written piece of typescript, something that he didn't seen in close to a decade.

It served him well for so long, his beloved coffer of wonders, his ark of the covenant. Piece after piece he removed little mementos from it and threw them into the fire. Photographs, keepsakes wrapped in old rags, notes. All one by one ended up in the flames making light dance on his warm face.\nOrders were clear. The colonists are to arrive. They can't see any of this. They wouldn't understand. No one would understand.\nHe looked for a while at one photo in particular, his eyes focused as if he was to see an old friend for the last time. Once he threw the photo into the fire he couldn't bear watch it burn hiding face in his hands, bitter tears forming in his eyes."

 nbe.7.title:0 "Like A Stream"
 nbe.7.desc:0 "It was another sweltering morning in the great Green Hell that surrounded the New Belgians. From Léopoldville to Uele, the Congolese suffered for thousands of hours on end, with no great prospect of life beyond working for the right to die with their comrades in the dirty ground. They knew this was their very tail end of a chance to finally supress the absurdly thin forces of the New Belgians, and so, a commander by the nom de guerre of Bantou had been organizing for months for a major revolt against the New Belgians. Hoping to quickly gain support of the Kivu Cult in the east, those dreams were shattered as the Belgians rode across the mountains and annihilated every element of Kivu's socialism. Then, Bantou realized he had to act quickly, before the Belgians got any stronger and began to dismantle his network of partisans. Therefore, he launched a rising north of Elisabethville in the south of the Congo, near a New Belgian arms factory. The hope was that the local slaves would rise up with their partisan friends, who then would wipe out the garisson in Elisabethville, then subsequently hold the fort in the newly-liberated city. Things went to plan for a while, with the local partisans driving with a stolen car crashing through the gates, weapons in hand. However, the white officer holding the factory together was just outside his quarters, and quickly reacted by using one of the slaves as a human shield, and then hid behind a munitions box, shooting at the partisans and dyeing the factory floorboards an inky redish-brown. After some time, he was wounded and shot a slave in the leg, as others continued to quietly labour in horror of the potential that they might be shot next, with another white officer shooting at the 10 or so partisans. As the gunfire slowed, the newcomer drew a machete and hacked off the limb of the wounded slave, then seized the severed limb, sliced it open, and shoved in a fresh-made grenade. He spun and threw it at the Partisans in a single shockingly fluid motion. Shocked, they froze for the single moment they had to project as the gristly projectile arced toward them. The grenade detonated, shredding the bulk of the surviving rebels in a hail of hot metal. The stunned survivors were eliminated with machine efficiency as fresh Belgian fire team entered the factory chamber. And so, the munitions factory continued its operations as the now-disabled slave received a chair to sit on.\nBantou would not survive."

 nbe.8.desc:0 "People have children, right? That's a thing people do.\n\nAt least that is what Pierre thought, as he was holding hands with one of the few white women in New Belgian territory. It had been many years since the unification of the Congo, and through a weak, but lengthy stream, thousands of Belgian women and men, sometimes children, arrived into the subcontinent prepared just for them; to treat them like gods. Pierre, a veteran of the Belgian Army Remnants, knew that his eyes looked nearly, if not completely, soulless. He looked at himself everyday in the mirror, seeing his deep, sunken blue eyes think about home. He knew that he had to make a home here, in this dark, green rainforest that refused to end. That was, of course, many years ago, and now he has a wife with him; one that read about these wonderful opportunities in a newly industrializing Congo, the jewel of her homeland which rose up against the death of her own nation. An immigrant from Dutch Flanders, she wanted to go to any place that represented her beloved nation, which did not have it's capital in either Liége, Le Soleil, or Amsterdam, but instead in Brussels. Regardless, she was Pierre's sweetheart, and the two had begun slowly sharing their language as per the New Belgian's  government request for national unity among the languages of the Belgians, with Walloon and Flemish immigrants, along with the soldiers themselves. Their child, Jan, was to be one of the first children born with a New Belgian birth certificate, and yet they wished to have so many more. Jan would be taught words in Flemish, Walloon, and words mixed together colloquially in the name of creating a new, New Belgian language. However, Jan will never be taught how much blood cost to create the nation around him."

As they reached Leopoldville, there were few celebrations, and more sighs of relief. The Belgians had pulled through, and finally could govern the Congo as it should be governed.\n\nPierre Ryckmans had begun his journey from Elisabethville to Leopoldville, slowly looking outside his car during the lengthy journey at all the animals and plants. Perhaps there were things to smile for in these virgin lands. Perhaps things were truly going to become better. Things had been painful and often merciless at the Belgian soldiers that just wanted to survive, and it showed in their deep, exhausted eyes. Thusly, when he finally arrived in Leopoldville, Ryckmans got to the largest podium he could find and proclaimed to an audience of white soldiers that he would... (WIP)"
