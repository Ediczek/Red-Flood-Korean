 POLITICS_Franz_DESC:0 "Though it seems history of a bygone age by now, Franz Ferdinand Karl Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria was not always the heir to the throne – and he could have lost it just as easily. From his early years he engaged in the Habsburg family tradition of military service, and due to a combination of genuine interest and his political connections he would become a vital link between the state and army, even being named Generalinspektor of the entire armed forces just before the Great War. Alas, the suicide of Emperor Franz Joseph's son in 1889 and the death of Ferdinand's own father in 1896 changed everyone's priorities. The bitter familial disputes over his plans to marry a minor countess almost derailed the entire thing, however, until a compromise was worked out whereby their marriage would be morganatic and prevent any of their descendants from succeeding him to the imperial throne.\n\nEven so, if the Great War had gone any worse, there may have never been an Emperor Franz Ferdinand. His professional concerns about the military and state seemed to be borne out as he clashed with officers about strategy, witnessed the consequences of lack of Hungarian funding to the army, and felt the nationalism of the empire's minorities grow beneath the surface. When he finally succeeded Franz Joseph in 1916, the state was reeling from Russian offensives and the German military was beginning to exert outsized influence over the government in Vienna. In a sense, this worked to the new emperor's advantage, as he was able to use the desperate situation and German backing to advance his long-term goal of revising the 1867 compromise – replacing Austro-Hungarian dualism with a federative model that would hopefully quiet Slavic discontent and reduce Magyar power. Although half of the empire would revolt in the process, the exhaustion of all parties to the war allowed a Cisleithanian core of the Empire to survive through 1918.\n\nEmperor Franz Ferdinand was born into an empire on the cusp of a great change, then came to rule during another. Headstrong determination saw him through every other crisis – familial, military, political – and he continues to loom as a rock of stability and old Imperial values in Austria. However, it cannot be ignored that he is getting older, and observers increasingly eye the young successor from another family branch when thinking about the future. With socialists to the north and east, the specter of ethnic separatism rearing its head again, and growing criticism of the imperial house from German nationalists, who knows what Austria he will leave behind?"
 POLITICS_Karl_DESC:0 "Hail to Kaiser Karl I, or Karl Franz Josef Ludwig Hubert Georg Otto Maria, or if you look into his other formal titles that have fallen into disuse, IV. Károly of Hungary. Like his predecessor, this was not the role he was born for – family tragedies and his uncle's dynastic compromises are links on the chain that brought him to the throne. As such, rather than receiving a political education while he was a minor, Karl would grow up focusing on religious practice, interspersed with army service and furthering his studies in law and political science. He never had a close relationship with Emperor Franz Joseph, and the familial divide caused by Uncle Franz's controversial marriage was evidently not reconciled until the end of the Great War – and until then, his education was on the battlefield, serving as a Field Marshal against Italy, Russia, and even briefly the revolting Hungarians.\n\nThis is not to say that the future emperor was a militarist at heart, however. Industrial warfare and internecine conflict in Pannonia wore heavily on his conscience and faith, and he was the Austrian official chosen to deliver the request for negotiations that ended the war between what was left of the Central Powers and Triple Entente. Evidently wanting little more to do with the army, he took the postwar demobilization as an excuse to relinquish command, and began the overdue work of being educated to rule.\n\nBut who is Austria's new emperor? Karl I has refrained from commenting on Austrian politics in anything but the vaguest sense, but believes in a common Christian brotherhood between peoples. Largely, the public knows him for his appearances at religious services and promoting charitable works around the empire. Less choleric than his uncle, and much younger at the time of his ascension, the emperor is seen as a breath of fresh air by much of the establishment, or even the moderate reformists. He has signalled a general agreement with the federalization Franz Ferdinand instituted, which has only entrenched the hatred that radical German nationalists have for his house. But while he is all things to everyone in fair Austria – a safe choice, a political dilettante, a good Christian, a liberal, a conservative, a traitor – only the future will tell what his true ambitions are."
 POLITICS_Otto_DESC:0 "Franz Joseph Otto Robert Maria Anton Karl Max Heinrich Sixtus Xaver Felix Renatus Ludwig Gaetan Pius Ignatius, who will hopefully henceforth be known by his regnal name Franz Joseph II, or simply Otto von Habsburg, has proven another Kaiser of circumstance. While some effort had been made to prepare him for this day, including a polyglot education, it had been assumed that his father Karl would have a much longer and happier reign beforehand. Yet another turning point has come for the Austrian Empire.\n\nOtto von Habsburg was born shortly before the Great War and largely grew up in the new Austria that came from it. Finding little place for himself in the army during peacetime, Otto's engagement with military service was largely perfunctory before he returned to higher education. In this field, at least, he was more successful, earning his PhD in the political and social sciences by the mid-1930s authoring a thesis on the country's rural land ownership laws. Though he never had the same public profile as his father, the future crown prince was broadly unobjectionable to the imperial public and court, being onboard with Franz Ferdinand's federalization agenda and holding his own in the local languages whenever he made a public appearance – even Latin, in church services.\n\nPerhaps in another decade or two, Franz Joseph II would have been better prepared for this, but could anyone have been prepared for the death of two predecessors in such a short period? He was given his name in a deliberate evocation of the venerable old emperor, and like that ancestor he has come to power during a national crisis. He would represent an opportunity to further entrench and build upon the federal model, but in this moment the Habsburg line looks weaker than ever. Lacking Franz Ferdinand's determination, or Karl's nigh-beatific devoutness, or either's time to practice holding the reins of power, he finds himself delegating to his new ministers. The shape of his reign to come, and of Austria itself, hangs in the balance."
 POLITICS_Mises_DESC:0 "Ludwig Heinrich Edler von Mises is the last man standing. The taming of the socialists, the fall of two emperors, the weakness of a third, the destruction of the social democrats, and the marginalization of the nationalists have allowed him to put his plans into practice. Real power now lies in the hand of Austria's head of government.\n\nMises hails from the old Galician provinces of Austria, from a family of landless nobility and mixed faith who would move back to Vienna while he was still a child. Young Ludwig would master a number of languages, attend the University of Vienna, and eventually go to law school. However, during his education, he would be influenced by local economists such as Menger and von Böhm-Bawerk, putting him on the road to working in state finances after graduation. Mises would wear many hats throughout his early career, whether a trainee lawyer, an economics lecturer, a member of the Vienna Chamber of Commerce and Industry, an artillery officer, and even an economic advisor to Austria-Hungary's War Department. His meteoric ascent would continue in the post-war, as he became the chief economist for the Chamber of Commerce and began advising on the messy task of reorienting the economy of an Austria shorn of half of its lands.\n\nBut that is merely a resume. What does Ludwig von Mises want? Certainly, his Galician Circle of fellow travellers built on the work of prior national economists to articulate a doctrine of purified economic liberalism – still something of a radical proposition in Austria. His increased stature through the years as a public bureaucrat culminated in him being brought into Kaiser Franz Joseph II's cabinet as finance minister. The horror of the Great War and what followed in Austria also strengthened his commitment against ultranationalism and imperialism. As a result, Mises found himself clashing with the nationalists like Adolf Pölzl while trying to influence the young Kaiser through the national emergency. Now, with every other entrenched interest out of the way, and the course of Austrian governance no longer at the whims of bizarre Habsburg dynastic politics, Minister-president von Mises has his chance to begin cutting the gordian knot of the empire's ethnic politics. What the good intentions of Franz Ferdinand could not realize will finally come to fruition, on the free and federal Danube."
 POLITICS_Hitler_DESC:0 "Führer Adolf Pölzl. No mean feat for a former choirboy from a border town. He could have been a priest – or taken his painting hobby more seriously, as his mother would tell you – but fate had other things in store for Austria.\n\nThe marks of Pölzl's upbringing lay heavily upon him, like how his family's short time spent in Bavaria left him with a distinctive accent. He would frequently clash with his abusive father, whose death nevertheless affected him just as the deaths of a number of his siblings. His teen years also saw his introduction to German nationalism that would grow on him through the following decades. But core to the brighter side of his childhood, Pölzl's devout mother Klara was a consistent source of support for him while he searched for a purpose in life – which was why her diagnosis of breast cancer was so devastating. Having begged the doctor to try experimental treatments, and having spent many long nights praying to God, his faith was seemingly rewarded by Klara's miraculous recovery. Such was his catharsis that he legally abandoned his father's surname to take on his mother's.\n\nNevertheless, Adolf Pölzl's time spent searching for purpose in Vienna as a grown man ended with the start of the Great War. Joining the Austro-Hungarian army, he would somehow survive the whole conflict, serving with some distinction through the fury of the Russian and Italian fronts. Though he was recovering in a hospital as the war ended, the now-veteran soldier would leap back into the trenches as a popular paramilitary leader against the independence revolts wracking Austria. The crucible of the immediate postwar period, not to mention the war with the red Hungarians, would further define Pölzl's politics, as his German nationalism collided with the realities of Austrian federalization and the German Revolution. Surely, the war had not been fought for an outcome such as this?\n\nThus was born the contemporary Adolf Pölzl, from faith, sacrifice, and struggle. The canny GSS leader, flirting with the edge of treason, castigated Austria's leadership and ethnic concessions as betrayal of the German nation – the true German nation, not languishing under the boot of socialism. When the door was finally kicked in, and the rotten structure came crashing down, he was there to seize the moment. Now it falls to him and his fellow nationalists, bolstered by exiles from the north, to seize the future."

It would be prudent for us to meet with the charismatic Pölzl to ensure his priorities still match our own, lest this mad dog decide to buck his leash and turn his bark into bite."

We will impose higher taxes on the aristocracy and the rich and make sure that our administration does not allow any loopholes in our tax system.

 AUS_subservient_council_desc:0 "Above all, our legislature is obedient. They may suggest improvements and tweak the ideas of the Kaiser, but actual opposition is basically non-existent.

Either way, in the great game of Austrian politics, the Kaiser wins."

 AUS_heed_minister_president_desc:0 "Minister-President Kalergi has proposed an alternative plan to the restoration of the Reichsrat. Under his plan, the legislative body would still be restored, albeit with far more checks available to the executive, consisting of himself and the Kaiser. While the SDAP may decry this proposal as a thinly-veiled attempt at stripping the legislature of any real power, it is in fact an ingenious plan that solves the flaws which led to the national crisis to begin with."

To whit, we have two major correctives to administer - first, breaking the political power of the nobles in order to clear the ground for the ambitions of the Austrian bourgeoisie; and second, cutting the Gordian knot of Austro-Hungarian ethnic balancing to create a more fair and equitable solution. Lucky us, our rivals are dead or marginalized, no?"

The social democrats wanted to strangle our business community underneath regulation before it truly had a chance to shine. It is our turn.

 AUS_triumph_of_gold_desc:0 "The economic shocks of the early 1930s prompted the imperial government to suspend the conversion of money into gold, a decision which has since been maintained. This was a mistake. Our currency needs to have its value tied to a stable item of value. Our history as a gold-minting country, coupled with gold reserves carried by Germans fleeing their civil war almost twenty years ago, put us in a prime position to do so. Furthermore, a return to the gold standard will function as a guard against reckless expansionary policy. Even the SDAP will have to live within our means should they take power once more."

 AUS_flattest_of_taxes_desc:0 "If we are working to encourage competition, it follows that we must not discourage people from the prize. There was a contention among socialist reformers and their fellow-travelers that there should be some connection between one's tax burden and their assets. Our Chancellor has been a longtime opponent of this, of course. Why should we discourage accumulation? Why should we penalize the people best equipped to reinvest their money? There are no half-measures in the liberalization of the Austrian economy - our income tax burden will be uniform for every citizen. The exact percentage will be argued in the Reichsrat."

With Mises' faction politically ascendant and conservatism being sidelined, we have a chance to take an axe to certain sacred cows. There are voices who caution against us - even the arch-reactionary Bismarck sought social stability through welfare and the regulatory state, after all. Once glance north will tell you how that ended for his successors. A short, sharp correction will lay the foundations of future prosperity for all."

 AUS_sloth_of_welfare_desc:0 "Man is a rational creature. He responds to incentives. A number of incentives our government produces, influenced by naive-hearted reform movements and attempts to buy the quiscience of the people, have produced a workforce insufficiently disciplined to thrive in a free economy. Cleaving off our federal welfare measures and moving charity back into solely private hands will push everyone to work harder for the benefit of themselves and their dependents.. This will have the added effect of making Austrian labor more competitive on the European market as artificial pressure on wages is reduced."

 AUS_greed_of_socialism_desc:0 "An unpleasant reality is that, as politics liberalized, certain wrong-headed tendencies and interests were able to exert pressure on the regular functioning of the economy. Unionization of the workforce - and its legalization in general - allowed for riled-up mobs to distort corporate finances. The regulatory state apparatus forced inefficiencies into the management of workplaces, or placed a thumb of government on the scales of competition.

 AUS_freedom_not_free_desc:0 "Just like with the aristocracy, there is opposition that will not simply surrender before the tide of history. In the face of our economic shock therapy, there are remnants on the right and left who resent our reforms. Common people who only see the changes immediately in front of them are easily swayed with simple rhetoric blaming the capitalist classes, or international Jewry, for their misfortunes. The capitalists who have thrived in these circumstances adore us, of course. As we cut the last red tape, perhaps it is time to allow them to take the gloves off once more when dealing with worker agitation."
 AUS_national_question:0 "국가적 문제"
 AUS_national_question_desc:0 "The inability of the Austrian establishment to gracefully address our national patchwork has dogged the empire since before the birth of nationalism as a concept. Frankly, the retreat of Hapsburg absolutism and the beginning of representative government heralded increasing nationalist division within the empire. Returning to the past is unthinkable, but even the SDAP's proposal of national autonomies was insufficient, and the dissolution of the state as a whole would be worse for the liberal cause. Our comprehensive program, practically emergency surgery on the body politic, has to be... innovative."

 AUS_representation_in_reichsrat_desc:0 "While the mere concept of direct democracy is already revolutionary and many eye it with suspicion, we must go further in the interest of true fairness. For centuries now, the many ethnicities of our Empire have been mistreated and unrepresented in their local governments.

 AUS_states_rights:0 "구성국의 권리"
 AUS_states_rights_desc:0 "The Ausgleich of 1867 was a clumsy thing, but was an early sign of the need to decentralize power away from Vienna in order to keep the disparate and far-flung peoples happy. If one cannot influence the government, if one has to obey laws they can't ever repeal, then that person is not free. A devolution of powers away from the core of Austria, allowing for greater autonomy in finances and laws, will raise the importance of local politics where smaller groups can have a greater voice - though at the cost of a more complex federal government."

All we need to do is cross our Ts and dot our Is in making sure that the last few steps go smoothly. Once this is all over, the world shall bear witness to the most harmonious society ever built, and the riddle of how to govern this polyglot territory in a free manner will be solved."

 AUS_compromise_with_republicans_desc:0 "The national emergency ended with the liberals atop an informal alliance that includes the shaky remnants of the conservative aristocracy... and a predominantly nationalist-populist front that, even beheaded, has no love for either of us. However, we can weaponize the latter against the former. An agenda of democratizing reforms would limit the power of the nobility to resist our programme, while also diluting the rage of the Pölzl-ites. Of course, we will have to work to sell this all to the Kaiser as necessary, but as the third Kaiser in a year, he understands the gravity of the situation. Regrettably, we will have to limit the powers of these traditional elites. Regrettably."
 AUS_shackling_lords:0 "귀족들에게 족쇄를"
 AUS_shackling_lords_desc:0 "We must fell the shambling horror of an ancient aristocracy who as they hobble to their graves do little but extract rent. We shall constrain them by introducing anti-bribery laws and giving all appropriately nominated politicians a stipend during election season - no more will it be the sole provenance of these idlers. The feudal era has come and gone - the industrial era has dawned and cast a burning light against the vampires of old."
 AUS_pomp_nothing_more:0 "화려함의 그 이상도 이하도 아닐지어니"
 AUS_pomp_nothing_more_desc:0 "The Reichsrat was designed to have an inbuilt balancing act between the House of Lords and the House of Deputies, where a bill's passage depended on the two strata of society that each house was made up of. In practice, this meant hereditary peers, life peers, and influential (arch)bishops could routinely jam a stick through the spokes of progress. Our movement, with the Kaiser at our beck and call, can strip them of much of their power. Giving the House of Lords a primarily consultative role where nigh-unanimity is required to vote down a bill could effectively take this foot off of our brakes."
 AUS_empowering_deputies:0 "의원의 권력 강화"
 AUS_empowering_deputies_desc:0 "What use is a democracy if the representatives of the people have no power? For centuries, we have lived in a backwards nation where the nobility are held in the highest regard and the members of the Reichsrat have been sidelined. This archaic policy ends now. While we work on reducing the power of the House of Lords, the House of Deputies needs a leg up. The processes set in motion with universal manhood suffrage build towards the votes of the people influencing policy - and little else."

 AUS_truly_liberal_democracy_desc:0 "Though Franz Joseph is still the de jure head of state, the minister-president and the Reichsrat hold the true power. In the past we have been a constitutional monarchy, an empire whose emperor is merely constrained in his powers by a parliamentary government which acts as a check on the Kaiser's power. From now on we are a crowned republic, a true European democracy that just so happens to have a monarch as a hold-over from centuries ago."
 AUS_smashing_autocracy:0 "전제정과의 싸움"
 AUS_smashing_autocracy_desc:0 "While our nascent democracy is well on its way to greatness, there are still some undesirable and influential elements who seek to preserve the old system. To combat these elements, we must ban extremist left and right-leaning parties, and significantly limit the privileges and powers of the nobility both inside and outside of the Reichsrat. Under these conditions, autocracy and dictatorship shall never again prosper in Austria."
 AUS_kaisertum_in_name_only:0 "이름뿐인 제국"
 AUS_kaisertum_in_name_only_desc:0 "Yes, technically speaking, the Kaiser's presence in our government defines us as an Empire, if for no other reason than we have an Emperor. However, our people and our politicians are well aware of the fact that true political power lies with the average citizen and within the ballot box. The Kaiser is but a rubber stamp and a symbol of political and social unity we appreciate and revere, but nothing more. We are a modern democracy, and no damned throne can ever change that."
 AUS_organic_restructuring:0 "구조 개편"
 AUS_organic_restructuring_desc:0 "Up until now, the direction of our reforms has been entirely conducted through decrees and barking a barrage of new laws at our institutions. This was a necessity when our country was still recovering from an ongoing crisis, but now it spits in the face of our ideals. Therefore, we must put more decision-making power in the hands of the people. Austria itself is like a whole body, and each of our citizens represents a single cell. When joined together, they form specialised organs that, when functioning properly, make our state healthier and more efficient."
 AUS_open_for_business:0 "Austria Is Open for Business!"
 AUS_open_for_business_desc:0 "It would have been easy to fail. Easy for the conservative way of doing things to reassert itself. Easy to go the way of so many other European states and fall to irrational populism. Instead, innovation had its window to sneak into the state machinery, and we took great strides toward resolving the persistent questions of the empire, or of the economy itself. The old order is dying, and a new one struggles to the surface, one never seen before - a liberal, truly liberal, Austria."

These are relics of ages past and unnecessarily weight down the power of the state. Our trusted and diligent jurists, inspired by von Keyserling's revolutionary writings, have found a cure to this cancer. The Führerprinzip, the Principle of the Leader, is our salvation. A means to our end, this sacred command makes it so Pölzl's word is not only burning wildfire, but also spring of life and principle of all authority, legal or executive.

Many shall have to be arrested and executed, many formidable structures tossed aside and replaced, many moments of uncertainty and tears. Blood will have to be spilled in a great deluge.

 austria.1.desc:0 "It was a chill February day in the Hofburg's Burggarten, and Franz Ferdinand's hands were shaking. The cold wind chilled him to his bones, yet the icy breeze was not what was shaking him, but age. He was approaching twenty years of rule, and had just turned 72 a couple of months prior. Some of his subjects in the streets even jested and called him senile, the nerve. Although, they were not far from the truth. His memory had been fading, and more often these days it was his nephew Karl running things in his name. Franz Ferdinand shook his head, and begun walking faster. \n\nTwenty years... He had done a lot in those years, quite a lot. Although the empire had shrunk, it was all-in-all a net gain to lose those pesky Huns, those architects of venom poisoning the lifeblood of the entire structure. His federalization attempts had been going swimmingly, and the Czechs had proven to be much better subjects than he had expected, and he expected highly from the outset. Franz Ferdinand's head began to hurt as he tried recalling all the events of the last twenty years, those magnificent years. Sure, the revolution had threatened his rule, and the issue of the petulant Pan-Germanic rabble always tended to rear its ugly head, but the common folk had never been the most peaceful. That is why they had a Kaiser after all, to lead them  and guide them by the grace of God. \n\nFranz Ferdinand's chest suddenly started feeling tight, and he slowed his walking pace. He tried to put it out of his mind by thinking about the future, and what would happen to the empire once he eventually passed on to Heaven, in a decade or so. He was sure that his nephew Karl would be a good Kaiser, but he worried sometimes about that boy. He was too soft, too easily persuaded by populist rhetoric and propaganda. It made him popular, sure, but in the wrong hands, he could upend the entire monarchy, and in these times, that was all Austria had. The Kaiser was a symbol of stability and safety, and without a Kaiser... \n\nThud. Thud. Thud. Franz Ferdinand's heart was tighter than a drum, even though he had been standing in place for minutes at this point. His vision started swimming, and his eyes shot wide open. \"Dear God, help! Someone, help me! Plea-\" His speech was cut short by a wave of pain, and he fell to the floor. This was it, was it not? The end, and so soon? He still had so much left to do, so, so much. His eyes, slowly closing, saw a figure approach him from above. An angel, come to take him to Heaven? His lips creaked out a soft answer to this grace, and Franz Ferdinand's last words were:"

He turned numb with surprise. Karl in the flesh, and his cortege is so close! Josef was seized by a storm of emotions. The gun was still in his coat. Stubbing out a smouldering piece of reassurance, he moved towards the rows of people, trying not to attract the attention of the police.\n\nHearing the cheering of the crowd, the monarch turned to the people and stood up, waving his hand to the public. Josef felt like his heart was going to explode with ecstasy as he made his way through the crowd closer to the Habsburg motorcade. Yes, he was lucky indeed to get so close to the route. There was even a roar of firecrackers from some local children. A moment like this only comes once in a lifetime.\n\nKarl was already reclining back in his seat, but he caught a glimpse of Josef's face contorted with a crazed smirk, waving a pistol clumsily. The terrorist managed to make only two shots in his general direction, grazing his chest, after which the policemen reacted and broke his wrist with a baton. While some of the people fled in panic, the Imperial escort rushed at full speed to the end of the street. The people seized the revolutionary from the police. He was beaten to a bloody pulp within seconds, so quick Karl could catch a last glimpse of his sardonic smile among the crazed mob as his vehicle sped away.

Children were hoisted up on shoulders to get a full view of the man who embodies the country, representing a lineage that united vast lands and survived untold turmoil. Even those with lukewarm feelings about the monarch felt giddy at the sight, honoured that he would make himself seen and heard. Karl looked at the people, then he looked back at his beautiful wife sitting next to him in a sparkling automobile. \"Do I deserve all this?\" He thought. \"Am I worthy of their admiration, or am I just a symbol, no more necessary than the flag?\"\n\nJosef Šoupal however, was less than elated, but he was giddy. He was soon to be a walking martyr, a hero of the people, and he would spark a revolution today. Walking briskly through the crowd he held his pistol under his jacket. Every moment had led up to this, everything was meaningful, even the bouts of tuberculosis incurred by too many cold nights in an impoverished commune. All the theory and political strategy of his cowardly \"comrades\" didn't give them the will to slay the state, the way things are, to make way for the way things ought to be. Did he value the emperor-to-be's life over his? Certainly not. At the end of the day Karl was a hapless target whose blood would stain the country's fabric red, like the flag of liberty.\n\nKarl waved to the workers, peasants, professionals, and businessmen. All loyal subjects, a throng of admirers who would kill and die for him. He felt safe in the warm bosom of his nation. While some leaders wouldn't be caught dead entertaining such an audience without a small army nearby, Karl trusted the policemen lining the crowd with his life. While the marching band stepped and played their way into the distance, casting a sonic spell to glorify their leader, while his wife blew a kiss to a baby held aloft, he made eye contact with a very dire looking man. This bystander was out of place in the revelry of the day and Karl couldn't help but fix his gaze upon him for a moment.\n\nJosef had his chance, and the bastard had glanced his way. A sure sign of their shared destiny. Out came the pistol, and over a guard's shoulder he placed three bullets into the would-be tyrant's chest. The princess screamed as if it were she who had been shot. If the guards had returned fire they likely would have massacred the crowd, but there was no need, as multiple men tackled Josef and began hammering on his head with their fists. The guards shouted to them to cease and they gathered around the man of the hour. He was to be made an example of, exactly how he envisioned it. Surely if the death of Karl didn't spark something, his death would.\n\nAs the motorcade sped away towards the hospital, Karl felt his life fading. He confessed his love for his wife and his belief in Christ, uttering his last words in a pained, breathy voice."

Mises argues that at the core of protests in Prague lay not economic reasons – but national ones. In his mind, the Czech national movement was hijacked by the Communists from Germany to destabilise our country and the best way to get rid of it is to appease it. He proposes that we promise to finish the plan of federalisation, fully recognising the autonomy of the Bohemian crown – thus calming down many Czech nationalists.\n\nHowever, a voice in the Reichsrat has risen in opposition. Another rising star of Austrian politics, Adolf Pölzl, virulently smacks down on any attempts of federalisation, framing the appeasers of the Czech movement as anti-German traitors. Hearing of Mises' proposal, he has called the Kaiser a \"slave to his Pharisetic accountant\" and urged all patriots to take action against the attempts of reform. While we could just ignore it and proceed with the plan, Pölzl has gained considerable respect and fame among our German population, especially in worker circles. Getting into open conflict with him might worsen the situation in Vienna, with another anti-Imperial faction arising. After all, if it comes to the worst in Prague, we can always send the army to shoot at the Czechs."

Pölzl himself has called the reform \"the only cure for the plague of Communism\". His rhetoric gave him a majority in the council, with most of the lesser parties getting behind the proposal. \n\nThe reform itself can be described as an appeasement to the workers – including expansions of their rights and welfare measures such as a higher minimum wage or guaranteed days off. Indisputably, if the Kaiser was to accept this proposal, many of the less ideological protesters would feel satisfied and leave their strikes – soon to restore order.\n\nHowever, our minister of economy, Ludwig von Mises, has harshly criticised the proposal. He noted its populist character and the disregard for our conditions and broader economic policy. In his argument, the short term gain of the workers' loyalty wouldn't outweigh the long term turmoil that these laws would bring into our economy. Thus, Mises urges the Kaiser to veto the bill, despite its broad support among the masses and politicians."

Showing them that the government wants no harm for the proletariat, and only aims to halt the destructive march of Communism could give us powerful allies in the fight. What we need is solid promises and an assurance of our good will. Gaining their trust, we can use the worker-patriotic agitators to get a large part of the disoriented workers off strike, thus calming down the situation in Vienna.\n\nHowever, some members of our cabinet, with Ludwig von Mises on their lead, warn of such alliances with potentially dubious elements. What seems like a lucrative deal now might have grave consequences in the future. Mises points out to the patriotic proletarian movement's connections to Adolf Pölzl's AHVP – a potentially dangerous faction, that despite its anti-socialism frequently engages in revolutionary rhetoric against our monarchy. If the AHVP gained too much influence, it could mark the end of our Empire with a blow from the Right, rather than the Left.

According to Mises, a minister associated with the AHVP will serve nothing but furthering their own goals.

His family arrived with him to help with his business. But what did he start to produce? In his new business called \"Paruweks\", he started selling the best sausages in all of Silesia. A good quality produced meat from the best sources and Polish traditional recipes that Germans loved, allowed him to beat the competition in every manner. 하지만 거기서 멈출 순 없었습니다. Not only did he also open a small but successful chain of butcher shops, but also introduced something revolutionary called \"닥스훈트\" or \"small dogs\". Stands appeared in the streets of Imperial Silesia where vendors put sausages into rolls and added tasty sauces to them. The Germans and the Czechs liked this combination, bringing huge profits. He once feared the xenophobia of Pölzl and his bandits, as well as socialists marching through the streets, but it seemed these problems had been resolved by the Ministerpräsident.\n\nNow he sat in his office pleased with his profits. He knew, however, that he was already old and the sausage empire had to grow. In socialist and Sanacjonist Poland, the thought of handing over the business would be inconceivable. He would have to resort to the black market in order to get the opportunity to transfer satisfactory funds to his children and their grandchildren at all. In Austria, however, Mises made it possible. He had never seen this man, but he liked to listen to his speeches on the radio - because a wise man is always nice to hear.\n\nHe touched his beard and grey moustache and blinked his eyes several times. He adjusted his red bow tie and began signing the terms of the inheritance. He smiled to himself, pleased that he had achieved so much in his life.\n\n\"I have built a monument more durable than bronze, higher than the Pyramids' regal structures, that no consuming rain, nor wild north wind can destroy. It's a monument built with the help of sausages! Freedom is love and freedom is hope!\"\n\nHe laughed proudly at his own paraphrase and signed his will with elegant letters ending his life's achievements."

 austria.405.desc:0 "루트비히 폰 미제스는 당황한 채 자신의 dining room에 들어섰습니다. There, sitting around getting drunk, were the more amicable leaders of every major republican party save the AHVP, all gathered together. It was a rather strange place to have a political meeting, but it was a safe one. As long as no journalist could use this for fearmongering - or worse, His Majesty overheard these conversations, it was the best place possible for the work ahead. The smoke of cigars filled the entire room to the point that Mises's speech was interrupted by a muffled cough every now and then. \n\n\"My friends, we have gathered here again to talk about a rather serious business. I already knew your concern about me getting this position but hear me out. I can't bring Franz Ferdinand down...\"\n\n\"So what are we doing here, von Mises? Aren't you a \"liberal\"? I don't know how you can combine your ideas with the plan of the monarch-boy.\" \n\nMises snapped in the direction the voice was coming from.\n\n\"If you allowed me to speak, dear sir, I would be able to explain myself. Are any of you familiar with the British system? I see no hands up. Do you want me to explain what I mean more precisely?\" \n\n\"No one can hear your thoughts, Herr Ministepräsident.\"\n\nThe same arrogant voice came from the crowd and won a few shy laughs.\n\n\"I want to lower Franz Ferdinand II's authority over the state matters to the point that he will become a figurehead. We can't shatter the glass too quickly. We must take it slowly, gentlemen.  Otherwise I would risk losing my position, and you would have your necks in danger. The Czechs as well as some liberal parties would be of use here. Yes, the minorities collude dangerously with reds, but we could compete with them and offer the Czechs an actual, proper federation. To calm down our Kaiser's suspicions we would have to sell him a nice story, that we want to soothe the quarrels among the people. When His Majesty is already fooled – we will be able to use our new machinations to restrict his power, again and again until his position is just a symbol.\"\n\nThe drunken gentlemen fell silent and began nodding their heads. They weren't going to applaud, but on the inside they almost liked Mises's idea. The monarchy, in the opinion of the majority, should be abolished, but a republic, even if crowned, was a wonderful step forwards. As they left the room, they all shook Mises's hand in turn and said goodbye to him respectfully."

He knew what it was – at last, the only remaining great monarch of Europe was leaving into the shadows. 온갖 생각이 오토의 머리 안에서 휘몰아쳤습니다. 정녕 역사의 필연이었던 것인가? 자신의 모든 광휘와 작위를 여전히 손에 쥐고서, 한 유대인 상인의 손에 이끌린 채 자신의 나라를 떠나는 황제를 조상들께선 어떻게 생각하실까?\n\nDespite his strongest mental pursuits, all of this was a mystery to him. 남은 건 오직 하나. 자기 운명의 수용. 무슨 일이 있어도 하느님께선 천상에 계시며, 선은 선으로 남고 악은 악으로 남을 것입니다. Otto did not doubt his faith; like a rock, it gave him a solid ground, keeping him from falling into despair. 모든 것을 잃은 것은 아니었습니다. After all, he was given a new role in the state, and he would do his best to serve his subjects in it. While the realms of governance were taken from the crown and given to the suits and ties there remained one thing – the spirit. 이 어려운 때에, 오스트리아인들은 여전히 믿음을 둘, 우러러볼 누군가를 필요로 했습니다. And Otto's task was to serve as this conscience of the people – to keep the healthy moral fibre and unity among them. The Austrians have to be proud of their Emperor, they have to remain loyal, lest they not fall to the reds or some charlatan like Adolf Pölzl. 오토는 알고 있었습니다. 그 책임이 바로 자신에게 있음을.\n\n오토는 의자에서 일어섰습니다. 창가에 서 빈의 지붕과 거리를, 그 속에서 걸어다니는 작은 사람들을 바라보았습니다. 이 새로운 미래가 신민에게 무엇을 가져다 줄까? 번영을 향한 미제스의 약속은 이행될 것인가? 아니면 그저 빈곤과 압제만 뒤따라올 따름일까? 수많은 의문이 답을 듣지 못한 채 남아 있었지만, 한 가지만은 분명했습니다."

 austria.502.desc:0 "Pölzl stood before the crowd again. Today, it was the parliament, but there was little difference between speaking to the deputies or the salt of the earth. The goal was the same - to convince them of their holy German cause, and to strengthen their will to fight for what is true. He stood behind the podium and below the giant cross at the Parlamentsgebäude in Vienna, and cleared his throat purposefully before beginning.\n\n\"My dear brothers. We are standing before a challenge. I am, you are, all of us stand united. We wish to achieve something great - a truly German state. But we are kept down from this beautiful dream by a mob of furious and irrational people. These people still fight in the name of the old Empire, that harlet of Vienna. The Hapsburgs led our people into a period of decadence, all the while sucking on the blood of the Germans to keep itself artificially alive. Are we going to do nothing about these madmen?\"\n\nHands that had been slowly rising with the pitch of Pölzl's speech suddenly clenched furiously. Even from the back of the room, one could easily see a passion and fire that flowed from his eyes. A passion that struck the podium like lightning to a rod.\n\n\"We must do something! Anarchy, poverty, degeneracy - these are the diseases that haunt Ostmark and its German people. They are caused by these devils, spread throughout the common people like a plague. Making up this Satanic caravan, you have the liberals who fail to see that the workers without bread will join the ranks of the opposition. Trailing behind them of course, there are the nobles who pretend to be pious Catholics, but in fact live a lavish lifestyle on the backs of the people. And at the end of this Hellish parad trails a mob of the worst madmen. Red-skinned Beelzebubs. Communists. Those who wish to destroy all traditions, rend our flesh, and poison our minds... they wish to take our very souls!\"\n\nThe demagogue snapped to look to the ceiling as if something seized his attention, something beyond the ceiling that he was privy to, and seemed to grit his teeth. Then, slowly, purposefully, he laid his hands against the desk and cleared his throat once more.\n\n\"I ask of you, my brothers in faith and in  blood, what is there left for us good men to do? We must build a homeland that will unite all Germans in the struggle before us. We must make these possessed spirits pray to God again, in the hope that their uncountable sins will fall from their backs. We must fight, fight if we want a truly united German state, made for all Germans and no one else! Do not our ancestors want us to keep their sacred traditions alive for something greater than ourselves? Do we not believe in the Heavenly Father above?\"\n\nAlready, he could hear shouts of assent from the crowd, and the tone of his address softened. \"So, gentlemen, we know we must do something. We must take firm action against everyone who wants to destroy our dream. We must wage war! War for the very soul of our nation! War against all the forces of the Devil! But brothers, we must be organised , as good intentions are not enough. The road to Hell is paved with good intentions, what we need now are good works!\"\n\n\"That is why I call upon you, I ask you, my fellow Germans. Do not stand idly by and let our revolution go to vain. We have had enough of weak Minister-Presidents and rotten Kaisers, what we need is a Führer! Sons of Germany, allow me to lead you, and together, we shall find the promised land! We shall find glory! We shall find victory!\"\n\nMembers of Parliament rose from their seats and began to applaud and cheer Pölzl. The latter, sweating, bowed modestly, and began to take his seat again. But suddenly, a young man shot up with his arm outstretched. Then another. Old, young, balding, skinny, fat, men of all ages joined together in one cry:"

 austria.503.desc:0 "Elijah was not an Orthodox Jew, and neither was his immediate family. He didn't feel like he owed anything to any nation, but rather to an international struggle against the old bourgeois world. That's why, after Pölzl's coup, he started working with the underground, knowing that the new government couldn't mean anything good for him. Elijah now stood at the corner of the street, hiding in preparation to attack a passing squadron of the state's militias.\n\nHe took out his handgun and took careful aim, and soon one of his targets had fallen to the asphalt below, victim to the thunder that leapt from his barrel. Other revolutionaries took the signal and enfiladed the men, quickly leaving them bleeding out on the street. There seemed to be no trace of more of these Pölzlite thugs, meaning that the fighters could cheer for this small victory – a step to the great victory: the emancipation of the workers of the world. Elijah hid his gun in his pocket, preparing to beat a hasty retreat, when someone screamed. \n\n\"Watch out!\"\n\nAnd a powerful explosion was heard. Elijah's handgun fell out of his pocket, leaving him unarmed and with his face on the ground. The cataclysmic eruption pushed him face-first into the pavement, robbing him of the use of his eyes and ears. All he could hear now was a terrible buzzing noise. Intuition said to him that the best solution for now would be to keep lying down, keeping his head low. After some time when the buzzing noise had stopped, Elijah saw a sliver of a man marching through the streets, checking bodies. Comforted by the sight of his surviving comrade, he began to lift himself up from the ground. \n\n\"Another one? What, the explosion didn't kill these rats?\" \n\nElijah's face dropped. These men were soldiers, military police that were especially for occasions such as this. A soldier came closer to Elijah and grabbed his head to turn it for examination. Hot, acrid breath filled his nostrils as the soldier leered at him.\n\n\"And what do we have there? A Jew! I knew that we were right about these pests.\"\n\nElijah couldn't find it in him to answer. Something in his chest hurt - broken ribs? Red hot arcs of pain shot through his torso as the other men restrained him. No, not like this... not when there was still something worth fighting for. Not when there was still a chance to break away from the mob and fight on. But he was made, and if any of the militiamen were drawn from his neighbourhood here and could recognize him...\n\nA few days after the incident, while pondering the fate of his family, Elijah was sentenced. The judge of the special court ordered him against the wall at the same time as a gaggle of other dissidents. Again, he wanted to argue, to say something inspiring to men who would come after him, but his thoughts were only drawn to the judge gravely reading out the beginning of the death sentence:"

 austria.505.desc:0 "The One, True, Catholic and Apostolic faith was brought to the Germans through sword and sweet words in a process that lasted many centuries. The strong and virile Germanic pagans could not accept a meek God, and so they were bested in combat and recognised Christ's strength and the vitality it gave to His people. Ever since these events, our race's fate has been irrevocably interlinked with the Lord's will. Our earliest form of identity was the Holy Roman Empire, after the Ottonians made the wild confederacies of Saxons and Alamanni bend the knee to the crown and the cross. The fate of Catholicism was put to the test on the battlefield after Luther's infantile revolt, breaking the heart of Christianity within Europe in twain. We have still not recovered from this tragedy, and Catholics and Protestants still fight in childish strifes every so often, like Bismark's failed war against the Church.\n\nWe are ready to enter a new era beyond this pitiful loss of faith in factionalism and secularism. Severed from the ties that chained us to a fallen Rome, Germanic Catholicism will fly up high and soar like a proud eagle once again, restoring Christian values to their rightful place in the sun. A National Church, whichever form it may take, is the only answer to the chaos of our times. From these renewed institutions we will forge a new lineage of Germans: a holy brotherhood of fierce and gallant knights, much like Sigfried or Gunnar of legendary cycles. Children and women will learn their own principles and heroic values in national fraternity as well, and no trueblood German will be left behind in the great reconversion of our people!"

As he leaned on the podium, the sun peeked out from behind the clouds, illuminating the stage and blessing the orator with its rays. He raised his hand upwards and then let loose his sharp tongue.\n\n\"German Volk! Flowers of the German youth! German women! Veterans of the wars for great Germany! I speak to you all with the same voice.

But! Not every German can see that, some are blind. They cannot see His blessings and escape from God's light towards the dark... they escape towards sodomic modernity, socialist lies, or stay apathetic to the sins of his neighbours. That is how the situation looks north of our border. Communists still butcher innocents! Not only are they innocent, but they are our fellow Germans! In the name of who do these callous murders commit their sins? Who!? I am asking!  I tell you who, it is Gog and Magog who command these so-called 'Spartakists!' We want peace, we want peace for us and our fellow Germans, but we cannot tolerate the barbarism carried out by these red devils!\"\n\nPölzl laid his arms on the flag-wrapped lectern - that tricolour kissed by a hooked cross. \n\n\"I cannot tolerate these attacks on our brethren and on you. This here is a declaration of war. War for German unity! War against communism! War for the very soul of our nation! We must carry out a fight against the ruling elite, that red-painted elite that sows discontent among the German people by making siblings kill each other. When we strike northwards, we expect the French to aid in our struggle against the Spartakist demon. With our loyal allies - those brave Swiss and Prussians - we shall liberate our people from the ungodly regime of the communists. We are still aching for a total unity of our race. In spite of our differences, we shall create a united front in the name of Germanic liberation!\" \n\nHe widened his arms as if he wanted to embrace every onlooker as a father, as a leader, and as a great lover of his own homeland. His words would cause a great fire in Europe, tearing an old continent apart yet again. His last words caused the crowd to cry, scream with happiness and declare their dedication to his struggle."
