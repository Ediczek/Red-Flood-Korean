 ORE_DESC_MENU:0 "Aleksandr Dutov and his Orenburg Army brought the area of the Kazan Military District and the Steppes Governorate back into Russian control during the Civil War that rocked the Russian Empire. Twenty year passed since then, but his realm hasn't yet come to know peace. Kazakh and Socialist-Revolutionary militias roam the land, while patrols sent to stop them never return home. In the far away villages, peasants pray for the end of these dark times, with whispers of a movement forming around the former advisor of the late Tsarina, Rasputin. Meanwhile, in the halls of the University of Kazan, other rumours flow, that of the aims of the Eurasianists who made the university their home. Will Dutov be able to brave his enemies, or will he fall down at last?"

He'd recieved his fair share of letters in his years as Kazan's leader, both positive and negative. It was always an interesting surprise to guess which type it was, and although he preferred the former, a quick scan of the contents revealed that this time it would be the latter.\n\n\"To the dishonorable Alexander Ilyich Dutov, may your organs rot in your body. For too long the tyrannical Russian state has suppressed the Kazakh people, the workers, and many others, while you serve as the hand that holds the whip. You are the embodiment of evil, only bested by those who puppet you in Moscow. You are an agent of oppression enforcing an unjust hierarchy onto all peoples under your boot, and I cannot wait until the day your rule comes crumbling down and your corpse is dragged through the streets.\"\n\nAs Dutov finished reading through the verbal assault, he crushed the letter up and tossed it away. He was no stranger to demeaning messages, and each time the small sting grew less and less. At this point they had almost no effect on the man, for it was so normalized in his psyche.

This meant that his job as bodyguard was invaluable now more than ever, which lead to frustrations when Dutov wished to have his guard stand in the background of the stage, in order to promote a more \"peaceful and welcoming\" feeling for the crowd. His foolish wish to appeal to the common man was a huge breach of security protocols, but Alexei didn't want to disobey a direct command from his superior officer.\n\nAs the speech started, Alexei tried to ponder ways in which he could still protect the Ataman in a way that would be more discrete than usual, even if it had the downside of making Dutov appear more vulnerable. After a short period of deliberation, he realized he could attempt to blend into the crowd, and although he would be abandoning his post in technicality, he felt that the safety of the Ataman stood at a higher priority than simple orders.

 ore.4.d:0 "With General Dutov's death, his worst fears have been realized. Kazan - the city and the district both - are in chaos. A chain of explosions rattled the city early this morning with a series of massive hollow booms, and bands of Kazakh partisans, pre-positioned in workhouses and factory dormitories or packed into leased-out flophouses, flooded out into the city. Some groups are barely controlled, but other bands display uniform weaponry and clear signs of training as they move to seize strategic points throughout the city and the surrounding countryside. Gunfire echoes through Kazan as the insurgents trade fire with paramilitary police units. The citizens have vanished, huddling in their homes and hoping to avoid stray bullets, or else hunkering down with what arms they possess to defend their own property. However, something is amiss in this attempt at a while coup. Messages have gone out, missives dispatched by an anonymous writer claiming to be a general officer of the Kazan Russian Army, to the garrisons surrounding the city. The missives order the troops to assemble and immediately march on critical positions, doubtlessly putting them into direct conflict with the rebels. But with the source of these missives unknown and their authority dubious at best, the officers are quarreling over the proper response. It remains to be seen how many, if any, of the garrison commanders will march. If enough of them move quickly, their regular troops will no doubt crush the irregular partisans. A partial or piecemeal response from the army will likely hand victory to the rebels and traitors - but with Dutov dead and Kazan in chaos, it is a mystery who would have both the means and motive to arrange the failure of the revolt."

Dutov was right that this event would be a peaceful one, and Alexei blinked again.\n\nBut as he opened his eyes, he caught a glimpse of a reflection being tucked into a jacket. Maybe a gun? Alexei's eyes shot wide open as he focused solely on the man awkwardly shuffling around with his pockets, and his suspicions mounted tenfold when the man started walking towards the stage. The man locked eyes with Alexei's frozen watchmen, and he made a mad dash towards the stage.\n\n\"Ilyich!\", screamed Alexei at full sprint. \"Get down!\" The man leaped onstage, brandishing a grenade with the pin already pulled.

He alone stood between Hell and Heaven, as the guardian of life and death.\n\nAlexei's slow shuffle through the powdersnow was impeded by the jostling of the crowd, and more often than once he had been blocked from any movement for precious seconds, a risk that he could not afford to take. As he continued surveying the area, he noticed a man infront of him check over his shoulder before moving towards the stage. Alexei, the vigilant guardian he was, flung himself forward, engaging the mystery man in a chase. The Ataman's face was surprised at this disturbance, and when he turned around to find Alexei missing, his fate was already sealed.\n\nThe man lept onto the stage and into Dutov, before a blinding explosion with the brightness of the Sun threw shrapnel across the crowd. Alexei fell face-down into the same soft snow that had kept him still, his conciousness knocked out from him.

With an imposing height and a beard a white much brighter than the snow, he holds a woman by her arm. She meekly follows along. Dressed in exhuberant traditional clothes, this is none other than sweet Olga. The crowd hold their breath, as to not break the enchantment of the scene. When they reach the chapel, Rasputin's towering figure puts the small church to shame. A young boy hands the monk a wreath of white roses. Sadly, there are no more \"royal\" crown for the soon-to-be Queen, but the peasant simplicity of this floral tiara only contributes to the scene.\n\nOlga kneels elegantly, as she did in the dances and masquerades of the Imperial Court she left behind. Rasputin, with a silvery voice,pronounces a formulaic prayer, before gently letting the wreath rest on Olga's temples. He lifts her up by her marble hand, and presents the new Tsarista to the public."

She helped prepare sweet blini with her mother and grandmother. She brought the eggs to the kitchen as her mother had asked her to do so. She turned to her daughter and said.\n\n\"Masha, as if you were so good. Could you make blini dough? I don't have any hands and we need to make another batch.\"\n\nHer mom said as she carried a hot plate full of pastries to the outside table. Her grandmother smiled a secret at her and said.\n\n\"Well Masha, we'll be able to do this together?\"\n\nMasha nodded and saluted her grandmother. She put the eggs on the table and began searching the kitchen for flour. Finally she found her while Grandma was breaking eggs. Masha brought the flour and put it on the counter. Grandma poured it into a bowl and added milk, eggs, water and salt. Finally she also added melted butter inside. And she gave Masha a bowl and a spoon for her to stir it. The little girl did so and handed the bowl back to her grandmother who started putting the dough into the pan to fry the blini. The smell of the pancakes caught the attention of the gray-and-white family cat of the Jazz, who hopped on a chair and stared intently at the plate of tasty pancakes. Babushka, however, scared him so that he would not try to eat them. Eventually, however, her mother came and she had something in her hand that made Masha happy. It was a beautiful folk dress and a colorful kokoshnik that she had been asking her parents for for a long time. She ran to her mother and asked.\n\n\"Is this for me? It's wonderful! I always wanted a dress like this!\"\n\n\"Yes my dear. I bought it from Mr.Yezhnev when he visited our village. I thought that it would be really nice if you could dance with other girls in this.\"\n\n\"Thank you thank you!\"\n\nThe girl said and ran to another room where she dressed quickly and, regardless of her mother and grandmother, ran outside the house. The first thing she experienced after leaving the hut was a snowball made by Igor - a boy she liked. She giggled and started collecting snowballs in her hands to start a snowball fight with them. Hiding around the corner of the houses, more and more children began to join their skirmish in colorful flowery costumes until they were all tired and soaked. When the parents saw their children when they returned home, they were nervous because the costumes had to dry for the festive dance. However, their anger did not last long as the next day was \"Forgiveness Sunday\". Masha danced a beautiful dance in a quickly dried outfit with Igor in front of the whole village with the rest of the children and young men, and the father himself hugged her, being proud of her. The whole family, father, mother, Masha and grandmother listened to the priest's short sermon.\n\n\"As every year, Maslenitsa reminds us of passing, but also of the joy of life that comes from Jesus Christ. Remember, that the time of the Lord's judgment is  coming for us at a fast pace and we must remember that all good things on this earth will eventually come to an end. For there is no joy greater than the source of all joy which is God. Everything comes from God and everything will return to God. Remember my dear brothers and sisters in Christ! We are ashes, and from the ground we rose and returned to the ground!\"\n\nSeeing the reverie and sadness of the whole congregation, the priest, however, cheered up and stopped speaking in his loud sacral voice.\n\n\"But let's have fun, because every saint is smiling. Bring in the Maslenitsa Effigy!\"\n\nThe two men went to a nearby barn to pull out a decorated hay doll that was supposed to be Maslenitsa. It was created by all young men looking for a bride, hoping that Maslenitsa would bring them happiness. At the same time, mother-in-law met with their sons' wives and bride to forge new friendships by frying bliny. The men hung the puppet on a pole and all the villagers began to bring the remains of the pancakes and put them next to the puppet, mixing them with flammable straw. At first Masha did not understand why it was done, but her mother explained that it is used to fertilize the fields and to bring fertility. She nodded as she watched Maslenitsa burn, symbolizing the end of winter and the beginning of Lent and Spring."

He was old, with a long gray beard, yet his heart was still beating with boldness. Most people spoke about him with terror and with fear. This man was called Grigory Rasputin and he prepared for another Easter. Through the whole lent he whipped himself and tried not to eat anything while trying to mortify his own flesh. The faithful saw that in spite of the demands he imposed on himself, he remained of great faith, setting an example for his fellow believers. Like him, many took off their robes while walking only in undershirts, whipped themselves and fasted - women, men, children and the elderly. Eventually, however, the period of reflection was over and it was the time of celebration. Rasputin entered the room and knelt. He did not invite anyone, but he did not forbid anyone from entering the room, so many gathered in the room with him. Eventually, however, he knelt down and began repeating a sentence over and over and over again.\n\n\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\"\n\nFollowing their teacher, many also got down on their knees and began saying a prayer. Eventually, however, Rasputin got up and spoke to the crowd.\n\n\"I thank you my brothers and sisters in Christ for this moment of prayer together, and now let us rejoice because Christ is risen!\"\n\nAnd the crowd cheered and Rasputin asked for a \"special\" Kvass (which he called holly), nuts, sunflower seeds, bread and honey. He spoke again when food was distributed to the congregation. \"Take and eat; this is my body! Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom\" \n\nThey served each other food and drank the Kvass together. Eventually one woman got up from a kneeling position and tore off her top coat, becoming half-naked. She screamed out loud as if she was under the effect of an aphrodisiac and other intoxicating substances. \"I'm full of ecstasy and fire! I feel like the Holy Spirit descended upon me. Praise the Lord!\"\n\nShe began to dance wildly, and many of them began to feel a similar elation. In the end, however, she ran into the dull man and hugged him, and even though he did not know her and despite his shock, he hugged her as well. Rasputin himself was neither eating nor drinking, but also joined the wild joyful dance. They ate and drank beyond their control. Even Sodom and Gomorrah could envy them right now and there was no Lot to save them from this joyful festival of sin. Quickly the room filled with naked bodies rubbing against other bodies. Man with man, woman with woman, man with woman - it didn't matter who with who, but the only thing that mattered was the fact that the Holy Spirit descended and gave His favors to all of them. Rasputin himself undressed as well, and despite his age, he was still vigorous and his body was a muscular fiery temple of the holy spirit. Many women were eager to intercourse with him. After hours of wild orgy, everyone fell exhausted and intoxicated. Only Rasputin stood over them all, still fully conscious and sober. His whole life was full of ecstasy and fire, so for him this situation was nothing new. He put on his robes and slowly left the room, leaving tired people to fend for themselves. Many then began to call him \"the living god\" even though he asked not to be called that. The people ignored his request saying that they saw him leave the room after this holy orgy by passing through the wall and others shouted to him saying that he isn't merely a man but an angel struck by his beauty. Eventually, life returned to its normal course, although everyone remembered well what had happened on the day of the resurrection. However, many were ashamed to speak of it or felt that the experience could not be repeated. Thanks to this, this orgy became an open secret to everyone and no one dared to criticize Rasputin seeing it as a miracle rather than a sin."

He was sitting in his office decorated with many icons staring menacingly at everyone who entered his house. He licked his sausage-fat lips and continued counting money, taking the coins in his as thick as sausages that his hands ate and arranging them carefully. He noticed, however, that outside the window, behind which snow had been snowing for several days, something was moving and shining. He was surprised because he did not expect any visit and his house itself was a few kilometers away from other houses. He lifted his fat body from the armchair and shuffled towards the window to peer out, rubbed the glass and saw a sight that disturbed him. A procession of peasants in winter clothes holding torches passed in front of his house. He expected that some communists or other madmen could raid the clergy, so he quickly removed his clothes, cross and tried to remove as many icons as possible and hide them under the table and tablecloth. With his eye he noticed that the procession was already standing in front of his house, so he put on a coat over his country shirt and left his hut where immediately, when he closed the door behind him, he heard a loud scream from the crowd of a man.\n\n\"FATHER YEMELYANOVICH\"\n\nHis worst and innermost fears were confirmed. An old man, whom Yemelyanovich recognized, stepped in front of the line. He thought he was already dead, because a few weeks ago his son was knocking on his door from morning to night. He began to recognize more and more faces in the crowd that were the faces of angry villagers from nearby towns. The old man continued his speech, full of pain and envy.\n\n\"Father Yemelyanovich, you are a channel of these lands and a parasite on the holy body of Christ, if only you were the only divine messenger, I would already be dead and without hope... Like many of those gathered here... But we have been enlightened by one man - Father Rasputin. He. He is a living saint and an example to the faithful of the Church. He healed me, bandaged my wounds and the grace of God fell on me through his hands and I got up! Can you say that you have done similar wonderful deeds, Messenger of Mammon?\"\n\n\"Relax! We can explain everything! Christ said you must love your neighbor...\"\n\nSaid embarrassed Yemelyanovich tried to calm the crowd, but in vain.\n\n\"And he also said that he will bring a sword! Brothers and sisters! Give the poor the riches of this parasite! And get him out by his rags!\"\n\nThe old man shouted and the whole crowd burst into the house, taking out all the riches and distributing the trinkets among themselves. The priest tried to stop them screaming in despair and wringing his hands, but they also carried him out and led him to a lower field, where in the darkness there was a pole next to a pile of wood, books and other flammable objects. The old man watched as the fat young priest was dragged by three strong men and tied to the pole. He tried to break free, but could not. The villagers with torches approached the stake and lit it, and the cleric began to shout even louder, asking for deliverance from the Lord. The Lord, however, was deaf when the fires consumed him and his sinful life. And the old man smiled, seeing that justice had been done, speaking only one word very softly in whisper"

Fear the darkness which demons inhabit! Bring offerings to the great powers of nature! They shall wander a world of terrible and incredible beauty, a mosaic of stories that conform a great piece of art to God Above! Let us return to wild freedom! Let us return to myth!"

Nay, there reclined the Horseman Death, having rode his pale steed through the gates of Hell. His skeletal fingers lay pinched inside a small box, before lifting the contents towards his visage; he allowed his weary mind to relax for a brief moment as he inhaled his great victory. It was short-lived, of course, as his apostles had already gathered around him. The white substance still poured from one of his nasal cavities as the fourth apostle opened his mouth to speak. His voice did not carry a hint of nervosity or reluctance to accommodate the new line the Rider had brought forth, but rather genuine confusion.\n\n\"Comr-I mean, President Savinkov.\" The apostle corrected his slip of the tongue almost immediately, though it wasn't necessarily wrong. It took every one of them a while to bear the weight of the ruling. \"We had established our presence in the capital, yet many allies of the past regime lie in wait.\"\n\nThe horseman raised his eyebrow at the confused tone, as did all the other apostles. Had the fourth grown soft in his holy duty?\n\n\"And? You are aware of what will be done, are you not? You know your catechism, and you know mine as well. Do you need it spelled out to you?\" The horseman cut him off almost immediately.\n\n\"I am well aware of our duty, Comrade President. But I couldn't help but notice that we had made no effort to organise tribunals or put forth arrests for the traitor.\"\n\nTrials. Just the thing he needed to hear. The horseman's tone grew more agitated, yet he did not lack even a little for conviction.\n\n\"Trials, paah! Ivan Platonovich, you have been a member of the party long enough to tell a man apart from a leech! What's next? Do you plan on putting cats and dogs in front of the court as well? Just shoot them, for the love of God!\"\n\nThe horseman leant back into his chair upon bestowing his gospel, some of the apostles forcing an awkward chuckle at the jovial comment. All of them sank their faces to the ground, only one word leaving their mouths afterwards."

 ore.16.desc:0 "The man had not slept well for weeks, yet his mood could not be more jovial. His hands, rough from years spent in hiding, wandering from place to place for shelter, were fiddling with an elegant and particularly stubborn lock. Twisting and turning in dogged defiance, the mechanism refused to give way. The lock's next frustrating snap was enough. Grabbing a blunter instrument, he bashed and bashed until its brass guts were spilled onto the cold, wet ground.\n\nAs tiresome as the process had been, the man still couldn't hide his wry surprise. Usually, the creatures he had been hunting employed much heavier measures to protect themselves than this. Those who hadn't long fled before his arrival sent dogs and bullets, and when cornered, their claws and fists. It seldom made a difference. After all, there was nothing that could hold him back from playing that mesmerising melody the master had taught him years ago. He had been made aware of the machinations of his prey long ago, their excuses and meaningless pleas.\n\nEven before he had joined the party, it all made little sense to him. How can you divide land when the land is everywhere? It is a mercy that other things can be divided more rationally. With the thumb from the hand and the head from the neck or the nose from the face, his hands shook as he drew the cuts. It was a pleasant shiver, though. Electric, full of restless energy. One that grips and holds and does not let go.\n\nBam bam bam...whack! Each note sung as sludge smeared onto his face. Left, right, left, right, and FIN! He could not have enough. He could never have enough. In the moment he was a church organ, his body alone playing hymns that pleased the Lord. And happy was He, because the man could not stop playing. It wasn't a matter of how, but of how much. Hours had passed with no end in sight. Tranquil, sombre chants and visceral, ear-shattering soprano screeches, all melodies passed through his body and soul. Bones by bones, he painted Our Father into the flesh of the beast.\n\nThe man dropped his instrument onto the ground, gazing at the work he had done."

 ore.17.desc:0 "The sky above was starless and moonless, as if all spectators had for a moment turned their gaze away from the face of the Earth. Inside the little shack, the boys attending hadn't gotten the luck to bring in any torches, so in absence of pale moonlight they had to do with the piles of melted wax that could hardly be called candles. It projected their gaunt faces and scrawny bodies, drawing grotesque shapes on the rotten walls that danced in an unnerving frenzy. At the centre stage, a lone black coffin stood. It had no flowery wreath or mourner escort, but nonetheless its elegant ebony shapes dominated the scene. No one dared speak, even those sickly enough to breathe too loudly were quickly scorned by stares from their companions until the unnatural silence returned. After some half an hour or so, the door behind where they stood creaked and opened with plangent moans. Impossibly tall, a black hood plodded forwards. No one appeared to pay any attention, as they had yet to turn. However, as soon as the figure walked past them, they fell to their knees still averting its presence. The corroded wood screamed at every step. It must be how they were able to tell when to kneel. It advanced solemnly until reaching the coffin, and then positioned itself behind it. Revealing chalk-white hands under the robes, it raised its arms and spoke.\n\n\"In the realm of the Dead, this youth has found himself alone and afraid. He sees naught but darkness and knows nothing but cold. Behind him, a life. Parents. Friends. A beloved. Sweat and tears. And then, nothing. He has met no God or demon, only silence. See for yourself.\"\n\nDeath then opened the coffin and left the body exposed for all those gathered. He couldn't be older than 16, and looked even younger inside the cushioned innards of the box. Blonde and skinny with an early moustache, his dirty fingernails and pockmarked cheeks told of his farmer origin. The antiquated suit he was dressed in said otherwise. Death caressed his fringe almost motherly.\n\n\"Cold and silence are not meant for this young man. A higher order has called him. This is our mission, as all here present have also returned from the world of the dead born anew. Let all those revenants tell of the way back to this kingdom of flesh and passions, so this lost soul may return.\"\n\nGathering became choir, and spoke slowly and clearly with purposefully deep and gritty voices. Above the coffin, the ceiling opened slightly to reveal a pitch black room and the scared snarls of an animal. A fawn. A diminutive red deer. If there ever was a symbol of innocence, of prey, there it was. Its laments only dragged out more and grew more desperate as drop after drop of blood hit the corpse in the face and suit, making him flinch almost imperceptibly. Droplets became a steady stream.\n\n\"Orpheus, return from Hell as we did, follow the warmth of fresh blood and the sound of our beating hearts, return from Hell as we did, feel the fire burn your limbs and body, return from Hell as we did and be born again.\"\n\nIn a flash, the dead man opened his eyes and his companions tilted the coffin from the table to stand upright in the centre of the stage. Still drenched in blood, he took a step forward, upon which Death put a white robe over him, crowned him in a straw wreath, and offered a knife. The revenant trembled like a just-born wild animal. His shadow fought against everything around it. In a weak voice and teary eyes, he fulfilled the rite under a starless and moonless light.\n\n\"We cannot love! We are spiritual vagabonds!

It takes me a while to adjust the tie of the jacket, which once belonged to the man I had killed yesterday, his corpse still tied and hidden behind the dirty shower curtains decorating the bathroom of this unassuming, middle-class household. Its location does not provide any sort of situational advantage over the other houses with views of the town square, making me briefly wonder why my hammer had fallen on him.\n\nPerhaps it was the sun that had clouded my vision, making me act upon a simple impulse. There is no blood on the jacket, as his murder did not require anything more than a well-placed iron in the coronal suture to knock him out cold. My face is uneven and my hair is slightly rugged, though that had not drawn attention to me or my coworkers when I had gone to the grocer to resupply yesterday.\n\nI do not drink, and I do not smoke or partake in the act of gambling or the consumption of other addictive substances. By the age of fifteen, I had learned how to reassemble my father's gun, and at age twenty and one I had killed him with it. I don't say this to brag, of course, for all of us have suffered our fair share of woes in this world filled with meaningless emotions.\n\nWhen the clock strikes twelve, I wait for a signal from my associate across the street, leaning onto the mint-condition rifle bestowed upon me for this holy purpose. As he yanks a grenade into the unsuspecting crowd of passersby, so does my trigger move, hitting the target with striking precision. I watch with a faint smile as his brains sprawl over his horrified companion; both of them soon trample under the emerging chaos. I shoot and I shoot, none of my bullets missing whatever they aim at. My hold does not ease until the rifle lets out a quiet \"clink,\" signalling that its magazine has been emptied. I make my stand atop the window, reaching into my pocket for the pill handed to me by my assigned politruk. My lifeless body tumbles five stories onto the ground, its shattered bones joining the bloody chorus underneath."

A military parade was in full swing, with a great cohort of tanks making their way to the red square. Russians, white, great, and small, had gathered to hear the words of their bellowed president, and the crowds below him gathered like a particularly gigantic flock of churchgoers. They had bowed as he tapped onto the microphone, ready to bear his words with almost messianic reverence. And preach he did, the voice carrying a certain flame in its tones.\n\n\"Russians! Heroes! Israelites carrying the torch of reborn Zion! Today, we stand upon the corpses of the Beast's servants, basking in the glory of conquest bestowed upon us by the Lord! Once made to bow before tyrants and parasites who knew naught of the glories of God, we had grabbed the strings of fate with our right hand and an axe with the left, cutting heads of usurping cheats who had dared to rob us of this glory! In a matter of a few years, the Tsarist taint upon this land had been undone, the serpent strangling the future of our children and the children of our children slain. All thanks to you: Peasants, farmers, revolutionaries, and soldiers of the dawn! We were nothing under the reigns of these devils, so let us be all in the hands of God! Reap the rewards of your harvest, drink from the barrels of plenty, and rest under the tree of life, undiluted by the smog of their horrible factories. The Lord had served us victory, his hammer crushing the tyrants without mercy. Let us advance mercilessly and diligently work towards a Republic of All! Through struggle, we have attained our rights, and it is our holy duty to protect their sanctity.\"\n\nAt his jovial raising of hands, so did the crowds raise theirs in cheers. Some clapped, some threw their hats in the air, some dropped onto their knees and shouted hallelujah, and some shot from guns as if to celebrate their victory. Everyone, sober or drunk, held an unmistakable fire in their eyes. They could not be certain of what the future would bring, but they were at least certain of one thing now."

Firstly education for the common man, so he knows resistance against autocracy is alive and well, showing the way for all those of brave hearts and fiery passions. Secondly, it educates the manyfold tyrants on exactly what is coming to them. No escape, no contrition, no hiding hole is enough for them to run away from their fate.

 ORE_seventh_seal_desc:0 "Silence falls over the Heavens. Pained shrieks, wailing screams, seas upon seas of blood as a mountain of corpses is claimed in the name of the Reapers toil. Just today, the voices of the Beast's servants draw out that of the martyrs who had laid everything for our cause. His scythe is relentless, his hands unshaken as he cuts through the parasites as if he was cutting weeds out of an infested garden. It is a good day, and our conscience is crystal clear: For it was not circumstance that handed out their punishment, but the Will of the Most Holy God. As the Seventh Seal opens, patriots make their move. No longer do we have to sit in wait, moving pieces on a chessboard with Death. Today, trumpets sound over the mountains of Rus, and its wayward sons have a call to answer: March with us, or face annihilation."
 ORE_smite_beast:0 "Smite the Beast"
 ORE_smite_beast_desc:0 "Moscow, Moscow...mother of beauty, first flame of the revolution, what had they done to you? The Beast rules in Petrograd, and its grip only tightens on your soil with every passing second, corrupting the good, laying waste to the holy. Worms, feasting on a carcass long rotten. No longer. A firm arm grips the revolver, slotting its round bullet by bullet. Those who had defiled Mother Russia, those who thought they could afford to spit in the face of God - They shall all pay. There is no target his bullet cannot pierce, no oligarch or industrialist, prince or tsar who can hide from its endless wrath guided from Above. Time to march, and time to put as many in the grave as we possibly can."
 ORE_whore_virgin:0 "The Whore or the Virgin?"
 ORE_whore_virgin_desc:0 "The kremlin deep hidden behind a veil of storm, hope to those who had once loved and lost. Many of our friends hide among them, Social Revolutionaries with a gun in one hand and a motyga in the other, awaiting our call to rise to the ranks of holy warriors. Though many of them had spurred us before, lambasting us as arrogant fools whose violent ways diluted the message of our movement into mindless pursuit of wanton cruelty, they can do nothing now except bite their tongues in shame, silently acknowledging that our methods had bore fruit. And yet we will turn the other cheek, for despite their folly, they too are brother revolutionaries. Yet they are not the only ones who await our riders. As did Old Babylon once reign over all kings beyond the Lord, so does Harbin reign over a realm of deluded ideologues, each as incoherent as the next. Bolshevik wreckers and Kadet alike hide underneath the shroud of good samaritarianism, hoping to turn our followers away from the covenant and into their wicked creed. The final decision ultimately falls on the President himself. Shall we greet our so-called \"comrades\" with open arms, or open fire?"
 ORE_new_jerusalem:0 "Towards New Jerusalem"
 ORE_new_jerusalem_desc:0 "A mighty chorus rips open the storm, the silence that preceded now a passing memory. We had marched through the valley of the shadow of death with nothing but our rags and the shepherd's staff as company, emerging victorious with laurels in both hands. The exodus had ended, Russia's everbinding chains melted down through faith and diligence of those who were willing to kill for an idea higher than their very souls. Its green pastures no longer stand overshadowed by that vile fog, its peasant no longer has to bear commands from mouths parroting foreign words and foreign ideas. We have conquered, and now it's time to reap, and to build. A New Jerusalem shall rise from the songs of the dawn rotten, one that shall surpass the one that was raised before. Those who were decried terrorists arise as saints in this golden age of Russian power, a testament to the ideal that all which is built with righteous intend shall withstand all tests of time."
