 ICE_danish_exiles:0 "아버지의 꿈"
 ICE_danish_exiles_desc:0 "덴마크라는 나라는 무언가가 썩었습니다. 덴마크의 신성한 땅이 신을 모르는 공산주의자 도당들에 의해 통치되고 있기에 참으로 부패했습니다.\n\n슐레스비히-홀슈타인인들이 튜튼족의 억압적인 통치에 맞서 봉기한 후, 그들의 정당한 왕은 그들을 자신의 영토로 데려오는 데 동의했습니다. 그러나 덴마크인들이 남쪽의 형제들의 해방을 환호하는 동안, 몇몇 보수적인 의회 의원들은 왕이 데인 인들을 해방한 것에 분노했습니다. 그들은 정당한 왕에 대항하여 반란을 일으켰고 독일의 지원을 받아 왕을 현재의 이 땅으로 피신하도록 강요당하였습니다.\n\n매일 밤 기독교인은 코펜하겐에서 다시 한 번 왕좌에 앉는 꿈을 꿉니다. 그리고 그 일은 이루어질 것입니다. 왜냐하면 하나님께서 그를 뜻하시기 때문입니다."
 ICE_lady_promise:0 "여인의 약속"
 ICE_lady_promise_desc:0 "But there are more things in heaven and earth, Kristján, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. For while the king of Denmark has a plan for Iceland, the people of Iceland have hatched a very different sort of plan. Though the progressive, socialist, and independence parties were all dissolved upon Christian's entrance into Iceland, the ideas that they stood for could not. For the quest to freedom is not a matter of petty politics, but a connection to the soil, to the Lady Of The Mountain, who will awaken and unleash a flood which will push the Danish wretches into the sea, once and for all time."
 ICE_another_generation_of_vikings:0 "또 다른 바이킹 세대"
 ICE_another_generation_of_vikings_desc:0 "When Copenhagen burned red and the Germans invaded, there was a frantic dash to escape the tide of socialism by many. Only a small trifling of Danes could flee, forty thousand or so. But while a small number for Denmark, it was not so small for Iceland, who has had to bear the brunt of their emigration. And while many Icelanders took the fleeing Danes as arms, the reception was not all positive. The island now stands divided between these new and old sons of Denmark, and for how much longer the situation can last is an enigma."

 ICE_arrow:0 "Høder's Notched Arrow"
 ICE_arrow_desc:0 "To his peers, and perhaps even to himself, Balder seemed invincible. He was adored by all, the fairest of the gods. He seemed almost destined to rule Asgård. Yet when his blind brother pierced his heart with a mistletoe-laden arrow, he fell nonetheless.\n\nThe young prime minister finds himself in a rarely relatable position. He is adored by the people, respected in his party, and supposedly the man for the job. But he is not without proverbial mistletoe; the failure of his predecessor has left the king skeptical, the people, though supportive, have enormous expectations, and then there's always the question of the middling Islanders. A single well placed arrow might be all it takes to end this arctic democracy."
 ICE_own:0 "Our Very Own Hoddmímisholt"
 ICE_own_desc:0 "A calamity approaches, and these new men on our shores seem to want nothing more than to pick up their spears and run towards certain doom. We shall do no such thing; for these lands are ours, and ours they will remain.\n\nThe man of the hour- there to witness every step towards the emancipation of his people, and then the sudden tumble backwards. But even after the sharp betrayal in 1917, Sveinn remains firmly committed to the ideal of cooperation. For however slowly, he will earn for his people their kingdom.\n\nFor the first time it seems truly within reach, with the Danish government largely detaching itself from its native counterpart, now able to focus entirely on the return. But should he fail in his task, it would mean not only the end of cooperation, but the end of Denmark."
 ICE_woman:0 "A Woman Scorned"
 ICE_woman_desc:0 "Deceit is no stranger to the people of this isle- for the last time we saw the light of sovereignty was the day we sold ourselves to the dreaded Haakon IV. Through trickery and sleight of hand the Norrmen, then the Danir have brushed us aside, moved us against each other like pawns in a never ending game of chess. No more.\n\nThis island is ours, we will not sit idly by while our own men are strung up and puppetted before us, drained of every drop of dignity. Griðungur, Gammur, Dreki, Bergrisi. These symbols are our protectors, and we, the lady of the mountain shall lead them in our crusade against the other."
 ICE_yggdrasil:0 "A new Yggdrasil"
 ICE_yggdrasil_desc:0 "Though the 9 worlds were separate, they existed only as extensions of the world tree. Denmark is much the same, with a territory that once spanned the entire globe, from Serampore to Cape York! Alas, those days are past, and frozen tundra is all that remains in the hands of his majesty. But perhaps, this is not all that was meant for us. No, our destiny is ours, and ours alone.\n\nWe must preserve our roots from The Nidhug in Berlin; the infernal beast. This can, however, only be achieved through a further harmonizing of our peoples, for we are all of the same blood. The Icelanders ask for autonomy, but they know not what they need. Given enough time, they will thank us.\n\nWe are not of this land, but it is of our realm; our Rige."
 ICE_maney:0 "Máney, at last"
 ICE_maney_desc:0 "I just don't enjoy Moon Island,\njolly though it can be\nwhen boisterous breakers wallop\nthe beach right next to me.\n\nFarther away, wee fledglings\nflop in the sea and drown:\nsurf makes the sea-cliff shudder\nand sends eggs pattering down.\n\nI hate it here on Moon Island,\nbut I have to stay, you see,\nwith my ribcage ripped to pieces\nwhen the rockslide fell on me."
