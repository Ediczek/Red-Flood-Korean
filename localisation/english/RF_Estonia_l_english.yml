 EST_restoration_of_independence_desc:0 "While we briefly flirted with independence during the Republican revolution in Russia, Estonia's history has by and large been one of German and Russian domination. Now, though, the chaos of European geopolitics has allowed for a unique chance at self-governance. Long Live Estonia!"
 EST_foreign_policy_desc:0 "As we have been ruled by foreigners for the last several centuries, our country has had little opportunity to determine its own foreign policy. Our newly obtained independence has set the challenge before us to decide for ourselves who our friends and foes will be in the coming conflict. One thing is already certain: whatever Estonia chooses to do, she will ensure her continued existence and prosperity."
 EST_question_of_latvia_desc:0 "natural that they should join us in trying to survive the next great European war. While they would most likely accept an offer of alliance, the more hawkish members of government have proposed a solution which will allow us to take advantage of Latvia's resources in a more… direct manner. We should weigh our options carefully, lest we risk losing a war to a potential ally."
 EST_claims_on_ingerimaa_desc:0 "Under the old Russian Tsardom and the Empire, Estonians were governed collectively with other Balts via the Ingermanland Governorate. We Estonians call this land Ingerimaa, and consider it our ancestral home. While the portion of this land pertaining to our national borders have been returned, Finns and Estonian expatriates are still brutally repressed by Russian autocracy. Me must lay claim to our old territories, so that our people might not suffer under the Russians any longer."
 EST_improve_relations_with_south_desc:0 "War with our friends and allies against foreign domination and oppression is unthinkable! Our chances of retaining independence are bolstered far more if we stand together as friends, rather than one of us sitting with a boot on the other's face. As such, we shall pursue a doctrine of collaboration and friendship with the Latvians to move forwards to a Baltic brotherhood against all who threaten us!"
 EST_improve_relations_with_north_desc:0 "The Finnish are like our brothers. Both in the realms of culture or faith or language we share many similarities. But more than that, we also share a history of oppression and rule by foreign empires seeking to exploit our people and take our wealth. Never has this been truer than with the domineering gaze of the Russians to the East. If we are to stand as much a chance as we can against them, let us work towards better relations with our Finnish friends in the North."
 EST_question_lithuania_desc:0 "With the Latvian question settled, it is now time to examine our options regarding Lithuania. Although they are a fellow Baltic nation, they have been independent for much longer, meaning our people have weaker ties than that between us and the Latvians. However, it may still be worth it to at least offer an alliance. If they refuse, we can always let their army have a meeting with ours to sort out any issues."
 EST_luuga_or_war_desc:0 "Enough is enough. For years now, we have tolerated Russian occupation of our outlying lands, including the valuable mining locality of Luuga. This land belongs to us, and what better time to reclaim it than when Russia has made so many enemies? Surely, if we demand our territory back, either Russia will hand it over, or our comrades in the Intermarium will join us in the struggle against them. Surely they will… "
 EST_baltic_federation_focus_desc:0 "Our army and state now control the entire Baltic region, however, we are still officially the Republic of Estonia. This needs to change, as Estonians now make up only a small portion of our population, and ethnic dissatisfaction could easily turn into revolt. Therefore, let us proclaim the Baltic Federation, which will represent all Baltic peoples, and will only just so happen to have a majority-Estonian government."
 EST_finno_urgic_union_focus_desc:0 "Though we are now a Baltic people, Estonians have an ancestral history with Finns via ancient Uralic tribes. We should reach out to Finland and begin fostering ties with them so that our people might one day reunite. At the very least, they will find us to be better partners than the Russians."
 EST_autocracy_of_pats_desc:0 "Although we dare not say it openly, Estonia is in a state of complete chaos. Extremist militias roam the countryside picking fights with their opponents as well as civilians, most high-value trading partners in Europe have either closed off diplomatic contact with us or just have yet to recognize our fledgling state, and all of this is happening while Russian troops hungrily eye our border. But they say hard times breed strong men, and Konstantin Päts is one of those men. A peasant with social-democratic tendencies, Päts has assumed the mantle of both Prime Minister and President during this trying time. With a strong hand to guide us, perhaps Estonia may just make it out of the 1930s in one piece. "
 EST_exile_left_wing_politicans_desc:0 "While President Päts is sympathetic to the centre-left, the radical socialist camp has long been a threat to stability in Estonia. The last thing we need are some damn Reds taking advantage of our national emergency to start some ill-fated \"revolution\" and throw our nation into total destruction. No, instead we shall cut off this tumour before it becomes malignant by exiling those to the left of Päts. Most will probably be welcomed by Germany and live cushy lives with the rest of their degenerate comrades, but President Päts is secretly hoping that some will end up in Russia, at the mercy of Kolchak."
 EST_eesti_rahva_armee_desc:0 "Since we struck out for independence, our country has been ravaged by various militias who style themselves as armies, but are nothing more than wandering bandits. To combat these militias and bring legitimacy and protection to our state, President Päts has officially announced the founding of the Estonian National Army. Recruiters are promising lucrative signing bonuses for the first to volunteer, and it's likely that any remaining gaps after the campaign will be filled via conscription."
 EST_one_man_rule_desc:0 "While our president and our people both place value upon democracy and collective leadership, now is hardly the time to be arguing over political minutia. Even the Roman Republic had its fair share of dictators to lead them through times of crisis, and the same power shall be enshrined in our leader, Konstantin Päts. And when the time comes, we can be assured that he will give power back to the people. Eventually."
 EST_crush_political_opponents_desc:0 "Opposition is healthy to a thriving democracy, but ours is hardly thriving at the moment. For the time being, anyone who opposes President Päts publicly will be viciously censored and repressed, so that our people do not lose unity or belief in their leader. Some may say that this goes a bit too far beyond our duties of bringing order to the nation, but those kinds of people are either in prison already, or they are about to be."
 EST_tonissons_cabinet_desc:0 "By the grace of the people, Jaan Tõnisson has been elected President via their first ever democratic election. Now that the social democrat has risen to prominence, it is time for him to build his cabinet. Made up of left progressives and moderate socialists, this new cabinet will employ populism and a big-tent philosophy in order to establish a strong popular base. May the Tõnisson administration be a prosperous and long-lasting one. "
 EST_exile_right_wing_politicans_desc:0 "While President Tõnisson is a believer in unity and democracy, some people just cause more trouble than they are worth. Already, right-wingers are hard at work spreading misinformation about President Tõnisson being a secret socialist sympathiser who wants to turn Estonia into a socialist-German puppet state. From riots on President Tõnisson's inauguration day to trying to cause a Red Scare, the right-wing is a plague on Estonian society. One that must be purged without delay. "
 EST_gain_western_support_desc:0 "While France and Germany may have fallen to extremism, not all of the West is lost. Italy, Britain, and the United States stand as beacons of democracy, bringing hope to democrats all over the world. We should petition these powers for an official declaration of support, so that our enemies might realise that our new republic has international backing, and won't be such an easy target for them to pick on."
 EST_coalition_government_desc:0 "While President Tõnisson's party has a comfortable majority in parliament, there are both symbolic and practical benefits to forming a coalition government. Let us join together with our leftist allies, as well as the centrists and remaining right-wing, in order to form a government of national unity, compromise, and populism."
 EST_welfare_and_free_trade_desc:0 "Our economic policies are our main area of disagreement with radical socialism. Rather than building an isolated, protectionist command economy, we will maintain free trade and free markets while establishing substantial social safety nets and public welfare programs. Ours shall be a fair, yet free economy."
 EST_stabilize_the_economy_desc:0 "Above all, our economy needs stability. Because of the recent political upheavals in our nation, our people haven't seen a stable economy in years now. By utilising Keynesian economics, we can ingratiate the people to our government by offering them their first taste of the prosperity that comes with independence. Although we refuse to take total control of the economy, ending the anarchy in production will help end the anarchy in our nation."
 EST_tallinn_industry_desc:0 "Tallinn is our most populous and productive city, making it an excellent choice for our capitol. If our nation is to see an industrial revolution in the way of other European nations, it should start here, in the heart of our republic. "
 EST_parnu_industry_desc:0 "Although not our most populous, Pärnu is a bustling city brimming with potential. Industrialising it is a natural next step in the development of our country, and will provide a much-needed boost to our small economy."
 EST_estonian_oil_shale_desc:0 "Estonia has very few resources to begin with, much less resources that the rest of the world lacks. And while we may not be sitting on the kind of oil seen in the United States, we do have an oil resource which is largely untapped: oil shale. We can develop this valuable resource to have a world-class fuel industry."
 EST_begin_the_hunt_desc:0 "You can almost hear the Flight of the Valkyries beginning to play across the Latvian countryside as our militias ready themselves for the Great Hunt. And while hunts are great for birds and foxes, our Great Hunt will target a set of prey that is much more cunning, challenging, and dangerous: parasites. German landlords, Russian partisans, and other would-be agents of foreign rule shall be excised from Latvia, like a tumour eating away at a once proud and vibrant mind. Once and for all, Latvia will stand free among the nations, at last in charge of its own destiny."
 EST_maanteeamet_desc:0 "The Estonian Road Administration, or Maanteeamet, is the governing body responsible for developing roads and other infrastructural projects in our nation. They have brought to our government proposals for several large-scale projects that would overhaul and improve our nation's road and rail systems and make themselves indispensable to the development of our country going forward. These projects should be approved and provided adequate funding immediately."
 EST_strategic_ports_desc:0 "Our position on the Baltic Sea gives us a unique advantage in trade and diplomacy in Northern Europe. It also makes us a high-value target for expansionists who value our location and resources. While military threats are certain to come over land, we must have a fleet worthy of defending our ports so that we are not bombarded from the sea and pincered as we retreat from the invading army. "
 EST_estonian_metal_desc:0 "The steel reserve of the Estonian nation is small to begin with, and much of it is currently in the hands of private holders. While mass nationalisation is too extreme a method for our government, it is critical that we fill in the gaps where we have need for it. A certain portion of our natural steel resources will be reserved for government and military projects."
 EST_narva_steel_desc:0 "Named for the river upon which it rests, Narva is an up-and-coming city which delicately dances upon the Estonian-Russian border. Despite its vulnerable position, Narva is a potentially abundant source of much-needed steel for our industry. Significant investment should be made into the development of this invaluable resource."
 EST_narva_industry_desc:0 "As the city of Narva continues to become one of the crown jewels of Estonia, the natural next step will be its industrialization. Narva's factories will tower over the Narva river, showing to the Russians across the border that we are a self-sufficient and industrious people."
 EST_viru_industry_desc:0 "\"Situated on our Southern border, Viru is quite honestly not much to write home about. It is a relatively small city with a large Latvian and Russian minority, just like most Estonian cities. However, it is this exact indistinct nature that leaves it open to potential, and open for business.\""
 EST_study_the_great_war_desc:0 "The Great War is unparalleled in its methods, scale, and horrific violence. Although we were subjects of the Russians up until the tail end of the war, our army and the veterans that helped us gain our independence were given tremendous experience that will be indispensable in the next war. We should default on the expertise of those who fought before to teach those who will fight for us in the future."
 EST_conscription_question_desc:0 "The debate over military conscription has severely divided the Estonian public as of late. The conservative side argues that without mandatory conscription, Estonia can never build the kind of standing army necessary for defending our sovereignty. However, Social Democrats tend to argue that the government should pursue peace as a viable option, and that conscription represents the sort of oppression that Democrats fought against when the Russians had our people in chains. The answer to this question can only be determined by the people via referendum in accordance with the constitution."
 EST_metallhobune_desc:0 "The advent of cavalry changed the art of war for centuries to come. Of all the innovations to come to the battlefield, the horse has few equals, but a newer technology threatens to make it all but obsolete: the automobile. By providing our army with cars previously slated for civilian production, we can produce a mobile cavalry force that is fast enough to encircle and overwhelm our enemies."
 EST_expand_the_arsenal_desc:0 "Our state arsenal is, to put things gently, basically nonexistent. In the face of encroaching invaders from east and west, this status quo cannot be allowed to continue. Immediate action must be taken to purchase and produce new weapons to supply our troops for the war ahead."
 EST_new_era_doctrines_desc:0 "Our veterans remember the Eastern Front well: dangerous, yet stagnant in most places. However, the openness and size of the front line as compared to the Western Front allowed for some wiggle room, where previously unseen tactics of warfare were allowed to shine. These tactics should be studied and combined with the knowledge our high command have gained through vigorous study in order to form new doctrines fit to the modern world."
 EST_form_kindralstaap_desc:0 "Because our army was only created recently, we have had to wait quite a while to see any soldiers be promoted to officers. However, recent operations have seen some of our outstanding officers soar through the ranks, to the point that we now have several renowned generals and marshals. We should form a general staff composed of the most competent army officers, so that they might guide our soldiers and form a competent military doctrine."
 EST_study_from_foreign_pilots_desc:0 "Planes are a relatively recent invention, and as such even our Russian overlords did not have time to develop an air force before our independence, much less bestowing one upon us. We now have an industry capable of producing planes, but hardly anyone knows how to fly one, and absolutely no one has any idea what a good air doctrine would look like. We should study the successes of well-known pilots across the world, so that we might emulate and one day surpass them."
 EST_plane_production_contracts_desc:0 "Aeroplanes are not exactly a high-demand product. Our industry has no incentive to produce planes, and that needs to change if we are to develop a competent air force. To this end, military industrial corporations will be offered lucrative contracts with the government in order to produce as many planes as we need."
 EST_balic_aerial_superiority_desc:0 "There is much talk both in cultural and military spheres surrounding the Baltic Sea, but what of the Baltic Sky? We cannot afford to neglect our aerial defences, for those who control the skies will undoubtedly control the next war. Our industry, civilians, and army forces can be decimated without the enemy ever entering our borders if they are allowed to dominate the air."
 EST_reform_the_miinisadam_desc:0 "Miinisadam is the centrepiece of Estonia's naval production industry, being Tallinn's main port and point of access to the sea. Despite it being the pride of the Estonian navy, it has one major issue: it is still calibrated to pre-war naval production. Material needs, work hours, and industrial capacity is all based on our needs before the war. This decrepit system must be completely overhauled if we are ever to modernise."
 EST_coastal_defense_navy_desc:0 "Whether we like it or not, we will likely not have an oceangoing navy any time soon. Our naval doctrines and production should be designed around the fact that we are a coastal nation whose defences belong close to home."
 EST_battleship_designs_desc:0 "Seeing as Estonia has not historically been a major naval power, not much thought has ever been put into developing our own battleship design. However, our nation now possesses independence and with it, our own navy. We should work to get the design documents we need to build battleships, whether we make them or buy them from someone else."
 EST_retrofit_the_navy_desc:0 "What few ships we already possess need not be scuttled or sold, when instead we can replace their old and outdated parts with portions of our new designs. These retrofitted ships will serve out the rest of their days with refurbished parts, and will eventually be replaced once they're destroyed in battle."
 EST_baltic_naval_superiority_desc:0 "The world doubted us. They claimed we were too small, too weak to ever take control of our sea. They told us it would always belong to the so-called great powers, the oppressors who see the Baltics as their backyard. But today, as our naval forces patrol the waves looking for enemies of the Baltic people, we stand proud knowing that we proved them wrong. The Baltic lads belong to the Baltic peoples, and now, so does their sea!"
 EST_unified_military_desc:0 "It is true that Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians have all fought side-by-side at one point or another, but at no point in history have they ever fought together for no one but themselves. Our army today reflects a change in this reality, for now Balts of all creeds and nations train together, eat together, sleep together, and most importantly, defend their fatherlands together. May the three banners fly forever more!"
 EST_baltic_regional_power_desc:0 "We stand now as more than a small, victimised nation stuck between two world powers. We hold dominion or influence over the entire Baltic region, and not even the Finns, Germans, or Russians dare to march into our land like it belongs to them. The Baltics stand firm and independent thanks to our hegemony. "

Masing is a voice of reason for the devil-worshippers, inventors of the perpetual motion machine, and humble servants of the Triune godhead of Estonian Poets. What they have in common, however, is a hatred for Europe and contempt for Germans and Russians, as well as a desire to radically revitalize Estonian culture.\n\nEstonia was the first prophet of the End of the Faustian Civilisation and the beginning of the Taoist Turanian Horde that will flood all of Europe! At present, however, we are at the mercy of the Messrs of Warsaw. There is no doubt in our minds that the Poles liberated us for their benefit, but for now we shall play their game; without them the Latvians and Russians would once again gladly taste our lands. We must consolidate, revive, and industrialize before we are ready to return to the grace of Taara. Let us hope that this unstable diarchy holds, otherwise we will be consumed by our own hearth fires and devoured by hungry dogs. We can only hope that our Prophet Kalevipoja will return in our hour of need and bring us one thousand years of peace."
