 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "대전쟁 직후 이어진 독일과 러시아의 붕괴에 따라, 폴란드는 몇 세기에 걸친 외세의 지배라는 잿더미 속에서 다시 태어났습니다. 피우수츠키 장군이 이끄는 폴란드는 이른바 \"인테르마리움\"이라는 동유럽 방위협약을 형성함으로써 독일, 러시아, 체코슬로바키아에 이르는 주변의 위협을 물리치고 이겨냈습니다. 하지만 이것도 15년 전이니, 피우수츠키는 이제 늙었습니다. 암 투병으로 병상에 누운 그가 얼마나 버틸 진 알 수 없습니다만, 대원수가 자신의 최후의 전투에서 패배하는 것도 시간 문제에 불과합니다."
 POLITICS_PILSUDSKI_DESC:0 "최근 몇 년 동안 유제프 피우수트스키보다 더 성공적인 인물을 찾는 것은 거의 불가능한 일입니다. 그의 겸손한 혁명적 시작에도 불구하고, 제치포스폴리타(연방)의 나첼니크(국가수령)는 누구보다도 높은 위치에 올랐으며, 국가를 완전히 변모시키는 데 성공했습니다.\n\n그러나 그의 가장 중요한 싸움은 그의 정반대 인물, 로만 드모프스키와의 대결이었습니다. 피우수트스키가 삼국 협정을 독립의 수단으로 여겼을 때, 드모프스키는 러시아가 그 역할을 더 잘할 것이라고 생각했습니다. 역사는 거의 드모프스키의 손을 들어줄 뻔했지만, 독재적인 차르 체제에 맞서 일어난 러시아 민중의 반란이 그의 예상을 뒤엎었습니다. 이 작은 불꽃은 서쪽을 불타오르게 했고, 피우수트스키는 폴란드, 벨라루스, 리투아니아, 우크라이나의 민중들과 함께 무기를 들었으며, 네 나라를 통합하려는 목표를 거의 이루는 데 성공했습니다. 행운은 계속 이어졌고, 복수심에 불타던 독일은 혁명가들의 승리와 독일 사회민주당(SPD)의 지배로 인해 그 위협이 사라졌습니다.\n\n하지만 그의 업적을 단순히 지정학적 성공으로만 언급한다면, 피우수트스키의 성취 중 절반을 생략하는 셈이 될 것입니다. 그는 충성스러운 동료들과 함께 사나치아라는 거대한 프로젝트에 거의 모든 애국자를 포함 시켰습니다. 이 조직은 백 년 넘게 자국을 잃고 분열된 폴란드인들과 그들의 정치를 회복하는 것을 목표로 하고 있습니다. 이 거대한 정치적 연합에서도 그의 권위는 의심받지 않으며, 그의 전설은 점점 더 커져가고, 그의 정부가 계속해서 성공을 거두면서, 일부 사람들은 그를 \"아우구스투스만큼 운이 좋고, 트라야누스만큼 훌륭하다\"고 평가하고 있습니다.\n\n그러나 행운의 여신께서는 언제나 미소 지어주실 수 없습니다. 피우수트스키는 이미 노령이며, 심각한 질병에 걸렸습니다. 독일에서의 독일 사회민주당의 지배는 언젠가 쇠퇴할 것이며, 러시아의 꿈틀거림은 곰이 다시 포효할 날이 머지않았음을 암시합니다. 그의 건강이 악화되는 가운데, 그의 마음은 여전히 이루지 못한 것들과 그의 노력이 지속될 수 있을지에 대한 불안으로 가득 차 있습니다. 그의 후계자가 누가 될지, 그리고 그가 카이사르의 뒤를 이은 아우구스투스가 될 수 있을지는 오직 시간이 말해줄 것입니다."

We are all united by a certain feeling and this feeling can be brought out by communing with art; MY art! And it WILL flood all of humanity!”\n\nArtaud didn't know what to think of Ignatcy Witkiewicz; Loud, unpleasant and unbearable. However, one thing was wrong; The lack of Cynicism he had heard so much about. Although wrong was the phrase; Witkacy was cynical to the extreme. He argued with Artaud about plays and said that ‘Theatre of Cruelty’ was a mere sham. He demonstrated the primitiveness of his theory by throwing himself on the floor and making loud noises in various frequencies. Only, this cynicism was somehow more cheerful and less malicious.\n\n“And Mr Witkacy... How do you want to achieve this metaphysical feeling? The reactionary Revolution you are introducing is more akin to Louis XIV than to the Paris Commune!”\n\nBataille smiled smugly while glancing at Artaud from time to time; was this how Georges felt when he was telling him about the Mexicanisms? The Pole jumped up on the table dropping the plates left over from the dinner and spread his arms prophetically.\n\n“Bataille! I can't believe that your vision is the perfect, bastardized unification of all humanity in an orange slush of floating brains! I have read your books and the communist explosion of energy is not dissimilar to what I want to introduce! Lust let loose in the erotic-economic dance of a new spontaneous religion! What I mean is that I, Mr. Artaud, you, that gypsy freak Shaytanov, Dalí and Mr. Breton have more in common than you think! And where is André Robert? I invited him to a meeting at the Belvedere not without reason! We are More popular than De Meistre and Bigger than Burke!”\n\nArtaud spoke up.\n\n“You're a reactionary, Breton said, and you might feel excommunicated from trying to contact him-”\n\n“Oh fuck him! I'll send the ambassador with instructions to bang his fist loudly on the window of his hacienda until he agrees to meet me. And then I'll tell him to his face to go fuck himself. I may not be a Marxdrone like Mr-There-Present Georges, but I am not a reactionary! I am at heart a Bolshevik! I took part in Dzierżyński's Attaché to the Kavkaz and killed some bastards with my very hands!”\n\nHe jumped down from the table and clapped his boots and hands above his head bouncing.\n\n“And now, gentlemen, I propose little-dancing to Góral music for better digestion!”\n\nHe grabbed their hands without warning and began to spin in a circle with them in a demonic trance. Antonin was still abashed by Beelzebub, but he could not deny that it was a wild and enjoyable encounter; To know that he was not the only one who still believed in the power of Heliogabalus."

He runs into the living room and there are; Ignacy Witkiewicz - The President, Boy-Żeleński - The Oppositionist, and Bronisław Malinowski - A Minister in his government. He takes off his cap and points his finger at Boy-Żeleński.\n\n\"What is he doing here and what are you doing? Is this some secret meeting? Żeleński works with the Kombinat Awangardzistów, they hate us because they are goddamn commies.\"\n\nThe three looked at each other and burst out laughing. They showed him to join them. Śmigły exhaled, rolled his eyes and sat down. Despite his reluctance to join the game, he was doing quite well.\n\n\"You should limit the role of the clergy more. You're such revolutionaries and one can't even get an abortion in this country.\"\n\n\"If it's legalized, it's legalized. And now stop bullshitting... When you're poor you have to think about work, not fucking. We should ban sex altogether for ugly and poor people.\"\n\nWitkacy mumbled, returning to the game. At one point he threw his cards to everyone's surprise and walked away from the table and went to the cabinet. He took out peyote and handed it to Malinowski, Żeleński and Smigly. The Marshal of Poland raised his eyebrow.\n\n\"What is this?\"\n\n\"Peyote, an Indian drug, a means of access to the metaphysical.\"\n\nŚmigły hesitated, but after persuasion and patting from the writers, he took the substance. It began to affect his hearing and vision centers, causing rich synesthetic experiences. Under the influence of the substance, Witkiewicz began to ponder over the cards.\n\n\"Antonin Artaud... He's the greatest thinker of our time! No! He is equal to the gods, Artaud becomes Kalki, Kalki becomes Artaud. He will end the revolution of 1789 and begin the revolution of the spirit! He will save Western civilization!\"\n\n\"Artaud is a sissy. If you need to Praise someone, Praise Apollinaire, Nungesser, Coli or D'Annunzio, even if he's also fruity. They are the true architects of the 1934 coup.\"\n\nŚmigły spit on the floor. Witkacy got upset and stood up. He growled like a wild dog under the influence of the drug and raised his voice, overturning the table with cards.\n\n\"In this house no one will insult Antonin Artaud! His name is sacred! If you're so sure, how about a duel of stupid faces.\"\n\nŚmigły bared his teeth and said, \"Stands.\" By faces, Witkacy meant drawing caricatures. Both men stood facing each other, Malinowski and Żeleński watched them. It took them an hour to finish drawing at about the same time. Malinowski glanced at Śmigły's work.\n\n\"In my opinion, Śmigły won, he captured your nooks well.\" Witkacy got irritated, started snorting, stamping his foot, but seeing that this boring military man Śmigły was smiling, he cheered himself up and said."

He was horrified by this feeling. He got up for breakfast; he tried to prepare it as simply and boringly as possible; Frankfurter Würstchen and scrambled eggs with bread. He poured himself an absinthe in a glass and began to eat. After the second bite he stopped eating; He enjoyed the food, he felt pleasure in his meal. It irritated him, he got furious and threw his plate against the wall. He picked up the glass of absinthe, he intended to throw it too, but gave up his intention and drank the contents of the glass. He turned to the phone to call Śmigły.\n\n\"Śmigły! Come to me, quickly! Something's happening to me, help for fuck's sake!\"\n\n\"I'll be there as soon as possible, call the doctor.\"\n\nŚmigły hung up. Witkiewicz called another number, but not the doctor. Śmigły's journey took several hours, but he reached Zakopane by train.  He knocked on the door styled in the Zakopane style and was opened by Artur Maria Swinarski. He showed him silently to enter. He closed the door and went in, seeing Witkacy sitting by the window. Śmigły took his seat and stared at Witkacy; He was thoughtful. Edward began unceremoniously.\n\n\"So what's wrong with you?\"\n\n\"I feel like I should have died in 1939. Cut my veins and bleed out like a pig I am. I feel like I live on stolen time. I'm happy for the Poles, I'm happy for life. It pisses me off.\"\n\nŚwinarski snorted. Witkacy stared at him with a heavy gaze then howled through clenched teeth.\n\n\"Maybe you'll be of some use Mr. \"Knock-Out\" before I knock all your teeth out! Give us Damn Tea!\"\n\nSwinarski fell silent and stormed out. Witkacy fell silent too, but quickly shouted to him again.\n\n\"And bring us some Diethyl ether if you please!\"\n\nŚmigły glanced amused at Witkacy. It irritated him that he was bothering him with such a fuss, but at the same time he found it quite funny. He uttered words from between his lips.\n\n\"Ignaś! Maybe you're just a healthy patriot and you care about your friends!\"\n\n\"Shut your mouth you Mud-Eating Deepfried tight military boy! I'M NOT NICE, I'M DEMONIC!\"\n\nHe pulled himself up from his chair then, seeing the amused face of Śmigły, calmed down and sat down. The Marshal said.\n\n\"There is nothing wrong with enjoying success. You yourself wanted to be like Artaud and perhaps you have surpassed him. We have shown those Muscovites where they belong. I’m not a fan of all of your oddities, but the whole world cheers you. You saved Western Civilisation, Bungo. To be appreciated, to succeed - Isn't that a nice feeling?\""

He noticed from over his glass that a man dressed in a coat and hat had approached him. He wanted to say something, but the stranger preceded him.\n\n\"Good morning sir... I would like to ask you your name.\"\n\n\"Edward Rydz-Śmigły, you should know me from parades!\"\n\n\"Oh, it's you, Mr Śmigły, sorry for my mistake.\"\n\nThe man said, reaching into his pocket for something. Śmigły did not sense anything wrong. Maybe he was after an autograph, he was also a media playboy after all. It was a handkerchief. Red and white with the initials \"E.R-Ś\" in gold.\n\n\"I'm asking because you lost your handkerchief and I wanted to give it back.\"\n\nŚmigły did not recall ever having such a handkerchief, but perhaps he had simply forgotten it.

Śmigły returned to consuming his coffee after seeing Roman leave the café. Something still didn't sit right with him though. He froze in stillness. Kuchciak was the name of a syndicalist terrorist from Łódź. He pulled himself up, but it was too late. Roman, coming out, gave a signal to the men in the motorcar by the window.

After the confectionery factory that his parents had owned for generations was nationalized, he was re-employed as a manager and at a union meeting was elevated to the position of chief executive. By treating employees well over the previous years, they returned the favor. With the help of government funding, he began to immediately tektologize the production process. Using techniques invented by Marian Mazur, Oskar Lange and Alexander Bogdanov, he was able to revolutionize the production management process. Although he was not the first to introduce computers into production. The first man was Bolesław Piasecki, who, despite co-operating with Zadruga, opened his own company, INCO-Veritas S.A. The detergent \"Ludwik\", which filled all the shop shelves thanks to Piasecki's clever campaign in which he broke gender stereotypes with a single slogan, was a success:\"Ludwik, to the saucepan!\". Wedel was particularly envious of Piasecki because he had managed to get hold of cheap labor in the form of the Priest-Workers and oppositionists who could not find work anywhere else through the terror of the Sanacja regime. Despite this missed opportunity, he managed to introduce some of his own original innovations.\n\nHe invited, therefore, the Minister of State Assets; Jędrzej Moraczewski and the Minister of Internal Affairs; Felicjan Sławoj-Składkowski, to visit and taste sweets. He welcomed them into a circular room where real-time screens displayed information and computers beeped merrily.\n\n\"Welcome to the E.Wedel Headquarters and Factory! I am pleased to greet you gentlemen and present the functionality of the factory!\"\n\nSkładkowski and Moraczewski exchanged a few kind words with Jan and asked the employees, who praised the Wedel CEO, to the skies.  Składkowski was no expert in economics, but  the speed of the assembly lines on which the sweets were laid convinced him of Wedel's success. Moraczewski, who was versed in socialist economics, was skeptical. Listening to the statistics they were able to drink warm but bitter cocoa. Finally, when they arrived back in the control room Wedel said.\n\n\"... I am pleased to announce a 400% increase in efficiency. Thanks to our revolutionary new product - Bird's Milk! A soft marshmallow coated in chocolate delight. Thanks to overproduction, I am ready to add that every employee will get a box on their own.\"\n\nMoraczewski and Składkowski were given a treat by Wedel and, after consumption, Moraczewski's skepticism disappeared; \"It's delicious, I guarantee you more funds.\" - He said while licking his lips."

The latest policy pushed by Tadeusz Dzieduszycki banned dishes  that would insult the whiteness of the Polish race. Bożydar did not care about the racial policy of the ZBSR, and he and his neighbor were white; what pleased him was less competition. Loosening regulations allowed the establishment to expand and accommodate more tourists, but the Highlanders came to Gdynia, creating competition for him.

But his happiness was fleeting.\n\nWhen the music started playing loudly because the musicians themselves had had a few brews they stopped holding back their musical talent and played loudly; Too loudly. The police who were questioning a neighboring businessman about his food also heard the sounds of the saxophone. Bożydar, who had been dancing to the rhythm of the music moments before, saw out of the corner of his eye how the police sent one officer to check Bożydarr's premises. He had forgotten that Jazz had also been banned under laws of racial hygiene. He turned white and turned to the orchestra shouting for them to stop playing.

Now, however, they have taken on a metaphysical significance; it was an attack on a living symbol of Polishness. Kazimierz did not complain. It was a trip for him; he enjoyed the sights of the Belarusian countryside. Hramada knew about this place but their sin were too big for people to know about it. He had access to stimulants and became an assistant camp doctor. He did not shy away from work because he saw other prisoners receive five to fifty blows in the face with a whip for avoiding the work. He did his tasks properly and thoroughly though there were not many of them. Therefore, he spent his time in discussion, conversation and deliberation. From what he understood from the wardens, this was one of many outposts scattered throughout the Intermarium; But, they proudly proclaimed that they were the first, established as part of the cooperation between Hramada and Sanacja. Even the most Polanosceptic movements in Belarus were afraid to reveal the truth about the Camp, as they would have to let go of political opponents who did not suit them.\n\nThere was a boy, a young National Democracy activist, who, surprisingly, was in a cold cell on a concrete floor with young Ukrainian nationalists. He did not go near them because he knew they could beat him up for being a member of the Jewish mafia. However, he overheard their conversation that it was a National Democrat who was sent to Bereza for a double violation of the law; Insulting the Name of Józef Piłsudski and Insulting the Religious Mariavites who venerate Piłsudski as Blessed.\n\nThe camp ‘re-education’ itself was manifold. Some were close to Sanacja activists who simply had to read books, often their own.  Others were regularly beaten with a truncheon and their stay in the camp prolonged if the educational programme did not work. In the worst case, he saw one of the guards order a young boy to lick his shoes and then send him to brush the toilet. The scene was memorable for him because the Guard yelled aloud; ‘You Buckled Dwarf of Reaction! You stand before the Titan of Sanacja ’ Kazimierz helped a few of them to recover from the baton harassment.\n\nHe sympathized a little with the bastards, but would be lying if he said he cared much about their fate. He was, after all, still a loyal Piłsudskiite.... Although after he was let go the paternal gaze of the Piłsudski portraits took on a harsher and more accusatory expression for him. That gaze looking at him accusingly stopped him from stealing further, he became a good civilian again, not wanting to visit Bereza again."

It was the largest gathering of Ukrainian nationalists the city had seen since the days of the War of the Winkelried, before Lwow was turned over to Poland. Of course, Ukrainians thought of it as just as Ukrainian as Kyiv was, but the government’s relative avoidance of the issue meant that, outside of the nationalists’ occasional attacks, Warsaw’s peace was kept here. Since Bandera’s takeover, that very much changed.\n\nToday, Ukraine left the Intermarium. The Kyiv government stated they had all the means to defend themselves against both Warsaw’s and Moscow’s aggressions. Celebrations quickly began among Ukrainian communities, and the policemen had the extremely troublesome task of preventing incidents from erupting. In Lwow’s main square, the task was largely being achieved, until the Polish nationals mounted a demonstration of their own.\n\n“No to the new Chmielnicki! No to Ukrainian revanchism!” proclaimed the leaders of a march entering the square where the Ukrainians were present. “Ukrainians! Those of you loyal to the country you are living within, join us! Those of you unhappy with us, the Poles, leave! Go back to Kyiv!”\n\n“To hell with Poland! This is Ukrainian territory! You, filthy occupiers, beware! We will chase you across the Vistula and show you your place!” replied leaders of the Banderite demonstration. “Leave the square! Do not mess with us or there will be consequences!”\n\n“Don’t talk to us like that! Especially in our own country! This is an ultimatum! You leave now!”\n\nThe Ukrainians didn’t respond with words, they simply let their fists do the talking. From all directions, men and boys emerged to counter the threats. The Poles responded in kind. The Poles, already walking on a tightrope, had to join in to end the violence. By the day’s end, the city had been pacified, but the situation already reached the international press.

When he joined the army, he hoped for a peaceful posting. War was not something many longed for, including him. His father fought for the country’s freedom, and he respected him for that, but enough blood had been spelt in the last war on the continent. None more was needed. He only hoped the men in Kyiv understood that as well.\n\nHis area was, like many others in the region, frequented by nationalist militants crossing into or out of Ukraine. Helped by their army, of course. Since Ukraine left the Intermarium, they could be blatantly open about it. Bandera had turned Ukraine into one massive camp, which he said was able to take on Warsaw and Moscow. Filip wondered if that man knew the reality of his claims, or what the Ukrainian people thought of him. Ukraine couldn’t simply face any of its neighbours alone. Just until a few years ago, their economy was propped up by Polish aid. Maybe it was all a ruse, Filip concluded, to keep up his popularity. Of course, that would run its course. The Ukrainians would get tired of living like that and remove him. The sooner the better, he concluded.\n\nFrom his guard post, Filip was able to tell a movement out in the morning crepuscule. A man, a partisan, a deserter? The latter were rare. He was heading exactly towards him. Was it an attack?\n\n“Reveal yourself! Show your hands! Drop your weapon!” Filip aimed his rifle and screamed at the shadow emerging near his guard post.\n\n“Don’t shoot, sir! I mean no harm! I am a deserter from the Ukrainian army! You are going to be attacked!”\n\n“When?”, asked a confused Filip.\n\n“Now, today, that’s all I know. We received the orders tonight. It is a folly, I know that. I couldn’t die in such a stupid war. I crossed the line. I have the plans I received with me. Please, don’t leave me here in the open. I will be shot!”\n\nFilip felt something in his mind, telling him that the deserter was indeed right. He climbed down from his post and called him to come. He didn’t know what to do with him. He resolved to call command and inform them. All will be well, he thought. Mayhaps war could be avoided.\n\n“Stay behind the wall, here. I will telephone my superiors.” he told the soldiers that was now just in front of him. He turned to climb up the stairs to the telephone, only for him to hear a gunshot behind him. In the next second, a bullet pierced his head from behind. He had no time to react. His body fell to the floor."

Szukalski and Stachniuk did not show hostility towards the Germans, so it was decided that the talks would pass peacefully.\n\nThe Poles invited the representatives of red Germany to Gdańsk, where it was agreed that in exchange for Królewiec and permanent low customs duties on the border on goods brought to Królewiec, the Germans promised to carry out a population exchange, leading the Germans out of Silesia, Pomerania and Masuria and also much more favorable for the Intermarium trade agreements were established for the import of coal and food from the Intermarium areas to Germany and Hungary. Such a move is to allow both sides to completely obliterate all age-old disputes and forge an alliance that will oppose both Russia's reaction and the madness of France."

After the Poles conquered Königsberg, we started negotiations in Gdańsk.\n\nBolesław Piasecki chaired the talks. The Polish side insisted on keeping all of Prussia in Polish and Lithuanian hands, but in the end we convinced them that a better solution would be lower tariffs on the border and population exchange, and additionally more advantageous trade agreements for Intermarium in exchange for giving Königsberg to us. Poles will lend us their railroads to transport goods to Königsberg and in return they will receive land and national unity.

Despite the fact that Poland was governed by Laïcisme, Walery Sławek approved of the participation of government officials in the ceremony of Piłsudski's elevation to the altar. Churches were separated from the state and religiosity remained a private matter of the people, but this did not prevent the POS from favoring the national churches.

Piłsudski understood perfectly well the need for the Polish National Church and the fight for the achievements of the Cyrillo-Methodian rite in the Slavic world. Every nation has its own Church that corresponds to the spirituality of that nation! Why should we answer to the Cosmopolitan Catholics?\n\nPiłsudski understood this need for Polishness and like us; He wanted to serve Poland and not rule over it! Piłsudski's miracles are clear, apart from divine intervention during the Battle of Kiev, Piłsudski possessed telepathic abilities and the gift of bilocation.

These lands once belonged to us. But well...

They carried the General out of the Belvedere window.\n\nWalery Sławek, who was leaving to finish his duties as Minister of Justice, was caught near the Raczyński Palace building. This notorious act was carried out by the Anarchists, who did not hesitate to brand him with blood by pouring pigs' guts on his bald head.\n\nAt the same time, the most bestial and sadistic treatment was meted out to Ignacy Daszynski, who was accused of being a demolitionist and a weakling unworthy of being Commander-in-Chief. The Tatar Pagans of the Death Hussars detachment did not fail to beat him several times, breaking his ribs.\n\nThey were all brought down by the empty Royal Castle and the seat of the Chief of the Polish State. Hempel, Piasecki, Stachniuk and, at the helm, Szukalski stood in a semicircle; Szukalski salutatorian spread his hands as if grasping the whole world and spoke like a prophet to the crowd of living fire.\n\n\"Comrades, brothers, sisters - Followers of the Faith of the Ancestors, believers in eternal blood and you furious ones! We bring to you traitors of the nation who have committed the greatest of all evil deeds and that is faith-breaking! How can people without honor lead us to glory when they are not honest to themselves?

His movement brought Ukraine into a disastrous war with its former allies, and his defeat brought his movement to an end just as bloody as its actions.\n\nUkraine would need a new government now, friendly to Poland and able to heal the country’s social and political life. Torn apart by ethnic hatred and revanchism, Ukraine became a mirror of the Russian empire. Luckily, there was a man perfect for the job. Petro Bolbochan, a renowned Ukrainian general, stepped up to lead Poland on the path of healthy reconstruction.\n\n“Bandera has led the Ukrainian people astray, with false promises of greatness and imperialism. He forgot Ukraine's real borders and meaning. In his dreams, Kyiv would be the master of all lands from Poznan to Vladivostok. It is true that we have brothers languishing under Moscow’s domination, but their liberation can’t come from a mere reversal of oppressors and oppressed. Bandera was speaking Kolchak’s language, he was unbecoming of what it meant to be Ukrainian.” proclaimed general Bolbochan before the people of Kyiv. “Intermarine friendship is true and sincere. They haven’t annexed any territories. They have made no humiliations to our nation. We’ve only been asked to honour our treaties and our alliances, which will. Bandera was the culmination of the chaos that Mikhnovsky began. Now, I will be the one that will ensure nothing like this will repeat ever again.”\n\nThe people had just went through a painful war, all in their very own names. Were Lviv and Brest worth going to war over? Now, certainly not. They scorned their friends, but they still welcomed them with open arms. Unlike Bandera’s gloomy predictions, Poland did not demand Volyn, nor did they force Ukraine’s economy into bondage. And they would be grateful for that and repay back their generosity. Lone claps were heard, and then the whole square joined in, cheering Bolbochan, Ukraine’s real saviour."

A radical republican opposed to the “3 don'ts” – Spartakism, semitism and freemasonry, Cybichowski takes his notes from various books in Europe where Dmowskis expertise is lacking, such as our Black Hundreds or the Romanian Iron Guard.\n\nFinally Stanisław Kozicki is the most orthodox choice, Member of the old guard of National Democrats and one of the men who had lobbied for the formation Dmowszczyzna, the agreement between Dmowski and Stolypin which would ensure the formation of a Polish autonomy within the Russian Empire. Such a decision was seen as blatant collaborationism then however, and his appointment would likely not sit well with much of the general population.

One of the leading theorists of Polish Nation Democracy, a movement that had largely operated in exile ever since the Sanationalist coup d'etat, Rybarski treats the fine little between the movements anglophilia and russophilia. A staunch liberal nationalist, his ascension would be a bone thrown to both sides of this double-edged sword of Polish oppositionalism.\n\nLast but not least, Tomasz Arciszewski is a London minded social democrat, frontman of the Polish Socialist Party of which Pilsudski was once a member as well. Their relationship had not been warm for years however, as Arciszewskis followers were one of the first Poles to speak out against Sanations blatant seizure of power.

His appointment would set Poland on a path of soft rebranding, retaining the economic policies of Sanacja while moving away from the ideas of Prometheism and strongman leadership. He wishes to syncretize a model of futurism-communism not too dissimilar to that of Kavkaz with Polish nationalism, bringing Poland to a new, modern age.\n\nMieczysław Moczar is something of an idealistic young man, leading a minor organisation styling itself as the Polish answer to National Vanguardism. His militaristic strain of Bolshevism merges with the pro-catholic and nationalist policies of National Democracy, a paradox he sees fit to put himself on the forefront of resolving. Often spicing his speeches with what mirrors the antisemitic rhetoric of more anti socialist Polish nationalism, many suspect there is more to his brand of “Proletarian Nationalism” than what meets the eye.\n\nJózef Cyrankiewicz is a functionary of the Berliner kind, an old dog communist with a knack for clearly defined procedures and keeping to political theory.

A republic born out of the people's sacred will, aided by our wise guidance. Piłsudski's regime made the mistake of driving a wedge between the Slavic peoples, but nothing is beyond repair. Soon a new Poland will rise from the ashes of what it had destroyed, more just than ever before. But who shall lead it?\n\nOur first choice is Jan Dębski: a major politician in the radical left of the PSL party, the main opposition group to the old Sanation regime. He is a representative of the populist agrarian movement sympathetic to our cause. It is this movement that he speaks for, and his plans include nothing more but fulfilling its program: reducing Piłsudski's breakneck industrialisation and urbanisation policies, conducting a radical land reform, and bringing the fruits of modern welfare to the countryside. In return for autonomy in Poland's internal matters, he would prove a loyal supporter of Russia on the world stage, with a large support base of peasants provided.\n\nAnother player in the occupation government is Bolesław Bierut: an odd figure, he's close to Jan Hempel, a theorist of the left-wing faction of the neo-pagan Zadruga movement and remains deeply influenced by his thought. Beirut's vision represents nothing less but a synthesis of anarcho-syndicalism with Polish-Slavic nationalism and folkish mysticism. Following the word of Hempel, Bierut wishes to combine what he terms an “Aryan” Old Slavic spirit with a maximalist communist project of liberation of the world proletariat. He spins colourful visages of workers freed of the darkness of Christianity, coming together to worship life itself. A regime like his could become highly unstable, and his rhetoric plays dangerously close to the tunes of Zadruga, but maybe it is revolutionary fire that Poland needs to recover from national humiliation?\n\nLast but not least, there is general Lucjan Żeligowski. A committed pan-slavist since youth, Żeligowski expresses an enthusiastic desire to bring Poland and Russia closer together again. However, Żeligowski remains loyal to the ideological guidelines of Sanacja - in which he sees a system, that once purged of the anti-Russian sentiment that brought the brother nations to a disaster, will guide Poland into a glorious future as a modern, united and disciplined nation. Overall, Żeligowski seeks to continue the policies of Piłsudski's nationalistic, industrial socialism aided by a new rhetoric of freedom and unity of the Slavic race. Żeligowski's strong hand will certainly bring stability to the Polish nation, and his slavophile fervour will make sure that an eternal alliance will unite our peoples to walk towards the glorious future together."

The Polish economy relies on foreign tourists, German goods, Ukrainian grain and many other things that we do not need for happiness - we can bake steel and bread in Poland and the snobs only make our culture a marketplace or a dead museum.\n\nA new zadrużna era is coming! And with it a new economy. Poland must make itself economically dependent on its neighboring countries. It is not a question of reducing exports, but of increasing them and producing what is most necessary at home.\n\nWe will have to recalibrate the economic course taken by Marshal Piłsudski and steer it on the right path."

The Great Cultural Revolution has taken place and we have transformed the spirituality of the Poles into a new more modern one devoid of the delusions of the Middle Ages. We are moving forward, but this is not the end of the battle. For the shortcomings of Piłsudski and his associates, and the legacy of Roman Dmowski still hanging over Poland, must be addressed.\n\nZadruga's tasks will include cleaning up the country's dire economic situation and unfinished business. Agrarian reform stuck in limbo, integration of the Intermarium, preparations for war with Moscow and general economic mobilization of the country. The very implementation of cultural reforms must be closely linked to our economic ambitions.\n\nFor as we proclaim, the nation is not a nation of individuals, but a single national collective united by the Ideomatrix; a guiding thought controlling whether the nation survives or falls in battle."

The Countryside is nothing and the City is everything for the City is the most modern human creation; A nutshell of everything that is modern and beautiful. Poland shall be one massive industrial zone that will unite Poles and then all Intermarium into one dance of production; We will become termites, bug people who do not forsake their individuality but know that the individual is nothing when the mass creates the future.

 POL_PPS.1.t:0 "Death of the Patron"
 POL_PPS.1.desc:0 "The day started horribly for Kazimierz Pużak and it was only up to him to turn its course. Ignacy Daszyński's death was sudden as its announcement to the highest authorities, who ordered a total blackout regarding the subject until a proper response was delivered. A calming response for everyone but the new Naczelnik. How was he going to tell an already grieving nation that in less than a year since Piłsudski's death, his successor was gone too?\n\nHe sat at his desk and began writing a myriad of drafts. He had nobody to turn to for advice. If word was to get out, who knows what dark and sinister forces could attempt at the life of the nation? He had to stay disciplined, and with him Poland. Daszyński never announced his clear timeline for holding elections, something which the streets have been agitating for since the Marshal's death. But Poland could not proceed with them today, or tomorrow, or next month. It needed time. Sanacja was a behemoth that engulfed all political life. Growing new movements, freeing the democratic spirit, it all took time. Pużak knew he had the power to do it the right way, it was built in the very system he wanted to dismantle! Suddenly, he felt the right words to use in his declaration.\n\nA sudden press conference was held in Warsaw. Reporters from Polish and foreign newspapers all knew it was about a major event, but no other details were given. Confusion was read on the attendees' faces and heard in the radio reporters' voices when Pużak entered after the Naczelnik's arrival was announced. The event was already scripted in his mind.

With a firm and calm voice, the Naczelnik spoke:\n\n\"This morning, the Daszyński household has informed our administration that the venerable Ignacy Dasyzński has died peacefully, in his sleep. Funeral arrangements have been made according to his last wishes. Given the current situation, I have become Poland's new Naczelnik. The planned reforms will continue as announced. The people are demanding free and fair elections, and we will grant them their rights once a period of proper reform from above will conclude. We have decided that these elections will be held in 1941, and will be open to all democratic parties in our country.\"\n\nThe hall was silent for a moment, then it erupted in applause.

This proposed period of transition to democracy is nothing more than another dictatorship. We'll be locked up in Bereza Kartuska and then PPS will hold their sham elections.

Pużak looked at them and then at the whole assembly to see how many stood in agreement. He was surprised at the actual reception of Witos' speech. In almost every party, some applauded and others sat in silence. In his own PPS, the deputies booed the outrageous statements. Being Naczelnik was especially hard today, being openly slandered by obvious power grabbers. Nevertheless, Pużak knew he had to keep his calm in this situation. There was great confusion among the Sejm over what liberalization truly meant even now, but Puzak was going to clearly explain his plans. The people were calmed when he announced a date for the elections. There was an antidote for the politicians, too.\n\n\"Neither I, nor anyone in my party, seeks to overthrow the government and cancel the great accomplishment made in the service of our nation and of our democracy. There's fear and confusion, and I will dispel the rumors surrounding our plans. We will hold to our promise of elections in 1941. Furthermore, we will proceed with rewriting the Constitution in order to limit the powers of the Naczelnik. All powers but that of the Supreme Chief of the Army will be granted to the Prime Minister and the President, who will be elected democratically.\", announced Pużak to the Sejm.\n\n\"This is not enough!\", Witos instantly replied. \"Piłsudski's constitution should be thrown into the Vistula the same way the French did with theirs in 1934! It has only enabled him and his clique to control the country without impunity. Every part of it is a real act of treason against our interests! We demand a new Constitution!

Like in many other towns in Poland, deregulation allowed managers to start their own enterprises, bringing in exotic products from far away places such as America.

Capitalism must be brought to Poland!”, a young newspaper hawker’s voice shouts to passersby, hoping to sell the paper.\n\nSince the liberalization of the political sphere, this has become a common sight on the streets of various cities. Some of them became nearly impassable as a result, with hawkers left and right, each trying to be louder than the rest, so that the message not only might reach the furthest, but also be understood. The Chrobry street in Gniezno, however, had only one. One of the men walking by stops, seemingly interested in the paper.\n\n“Don’t we... already have capitalism, young man?”, he asks.\n\n“Here we do, but look behind me!”, the hawker points to the state-owned Społem grocery store behind him. “Socialism still lives there! It’s about time we do something about it, about the bloat it creates!”\n\n“Doesn’t it still have to abide by market rules? After all, if nobody bought there, surely the stores couldn’t be kept.”\n\n“Sir, that’s not how this works. The state-owned proposition has natural advantage over private owners, as the state can set the prices as low as it wants to! Tell me, sir, if you had a store, and your state-owned competitor didn’t have to care about the prices, because they have effectively infinite funds, would that be fair? We, who vote for Koneczny, want to put a stop to this! The state must not interfere! Sir, if you want to know more, buy our newspaper - About Time!”\n\nThe man, after the young hawker’s onslaught of liberal concepts, thinks for a moment. He thinks about whether he can afford buying another paper from another party. PSL, PPS, Endeks, even, got his money, and now, this “About Time” thing. Eventually, he decides that if he’s going to vote, he must be informed. He takes out a 10 grosz coin and hands it to the hawker, in a free-market exchange between two sovereign citizens.

How can we save Poland if we can’t have the army at our side?” Puzak thought for a second. “Should we purge them?”\n\n“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

The period of custodianship was over, he announced, democracy was here to stay for good. But even the government's words and its promised period of adaptation did not fully erase the marks of a newborn democracy. In the last years, the Poles grew accustomed to the other face of democracy. Countless marches over any minor disagreement, a deluge of newspapers, radical youth wing and clashes with the police, to some those were nevertheless the sights of real freedom. Five major parties left their greatest impression among the Polish electorate. Some were veteran forces, some were bold newcomers, but all of them promised an appealing future to Poland's many faces.\n\nThe center-left ZLN, under Stanisław Grabski, is a double-edged sword. Its attractive agenda of Westernisation through liberal and moderately classical-radical means presents an attractive option, free from the radical ideas of German socialism and French futurism. In total contrast, its youth wing, led by Adam Doboszyński, represents the most reactionary tendency in current politics. Antisemitic, anti-industrial, anti-urban and anti-Intermarium, but for now powerless, empowering its mother party would open the doors to killing Polish democracy and modernity in its infancy.\n\nThe SK “Piast” presents a safer option for Poland's moderates, being founded by some of Poland's independence figures. Inspired by American values, its program is built around eventually federalising the Intermarium. Meanwhile, the SL “Radykalne” has been the party of opposition by excellence. The first leftists to oppose Pilsudski's deal with the landowners, connected with the futurists, and espousing agrarian radicalism, they would continue the modern Poland's chain of constant revolutions.\n\nThe PSCHD presents yet another radical break with the past, but this time into free market liberalism. Led by Felix Koneczny, the party has called for radical deregulation and civic nationalism, drawing heavy support from various entrepreneurs and the Catholic intellectuals.\n\nBut against all these parties, there's still a major force to be reckoned with. Puzak's PPS has brought Poland here. Won't democracy's heralds also be its best custodians? The party is counting on a victory, betting on its excellent performance at the helm of Poland so far."

Walery Slawek was musing on this as he found himself in front of the very same monument, attending the very same Marshal's speech on Intermarine unity. The audience of Intermarine,  German, French and Yellow Russian diplomats was relieved to hear of the continued progress of the alliance's projects, and its exemplary unity. It was perhaps these thoughts that made Slawek turn to his right, to Ignacy Daszyński.\n\n“What's next for us?” asked Slawek, inviting conversation.\n\nDaszyński seemed to maintain his quiet observation, but then turned to reply. “For us? Just milk and honey,” he replied.\n\n“Don't be rude now...Take a look around, Ignacy. Around our seats... and around our borders, too...”\n\nIgnacy turned his sights on the men around him, listening attentively to Pilsudski's speech.

If they attack, it'll be their end.”\n\n“You may be right. After all, under us and our Marshal, Poland and the Intermarium have only known success after success..” Slawek was about to continue when he realized the speech had abruptly come to an end.

He began the meeting with military affairs; with the suggestion of sullying up two more divisions. What he thought would be a popular suggestion ran into the wall of typical Daszyński dithering, and Pilsudski began to feel the ache of gravity upon his bones.\n“What of the budget?

His eyes shot over to look at his Minister for Foreign Affairs with characteristic swiftness, if not the old clarity.\n\n\"About Mikhnovsky.\"\n\n\"Well, truth be told, he's a son of a whore.\"\n\nBeck returned to the matter at hand. \"I don't know if we can convince him to shut up about Lviv now, let alone about wanting to leave the Intermarium.\"\n\n\"Great,” he grunted in reply, back to looking elsewhere. He was searching for something else... Yes, a good smoke would be nice.\n\n\"What's an old man to do to get a smoke here?\" He motioned to the bedside table, on which sat some documents and a glass of water. Right, under the reports...\n\n\"Let me,\" chimed Moraczewski, head of the Union of Trade Unions. He retrieved the little tin and popped it open, producing a cigar.\n\nThe Marshal could find something to grin about there. \"Thank you. Anything new in Vilnius?\"\n\n\"Another attack on some stores. Ironically, Jews doing it to Lithuanians this time. Seems like they had enough bricks through their windows.\"\n\nPiłsudski sighed as he pulled a match from his pocket and struck it. \"Anything good?\"\n\nA young nurse spotted the woosh of flame from the other side of the ward. \"No no no! Mr Piłsudski, you can't smoke, you promised!\" She rushed over, trying to shove her way past the men to grab it from him. The Marshal, for his part, just stared her down, flame licking at the cigar hungrily and greedily. Kwiatkowski, the Economic Minister, put his arm out to motion for her to stop, then spoke up. \"Well, Gdynia has reported record export volumes. As for SOP and L-LOP, well it's been looking good. With the kind of industrial output Lviv has, I can see why the Ukrainians want their hands on it.\"\n\nPiłsudski smiled and began puffing on his cigar. The tobacco turned black and then into glowing embers. Good. He took a drag. A nice one. He'd really been craving it. The nicotine flooded his old body, calming him. Another. He felt himself sink deeply into the mattress. He felt dizzy, and then nauseous. He took another."

Witkacy got to work on the portrait. Surprisingly, the artist and the Marshal found common ground in being men of great vision.\n\n“And what of the banks? Those strongholds of reaction?” Witkacy asked.\n\n“What of them? Are you insinuating that the strict regulations of our administration have been ineffective? That Poland remains shackled to the rentier powers of yesterday?” The Marshal replied with a wry smile. “Couldn't be.”\n\nWitkacy deadpanned in return: “If only all things were as easy as conducting military miracles.” The Marshal scoffed. When he returned his gaze to the man, Witkacy rotated the easel to show his work, and Witkacy grinned as he saw the bushy eyebrows raise. The face seemed so imperious, so regal, so true to form.\n\n“I... I like it,” he eventually mustered. “Tell me again, what do you call your school, or movement, or what have you?” Witkacy shrugged and Pilsudski resumed his musing, staring at his own visage. But this also reminded him of recent briefings on goings-ons in France and Kavkaz, and he saw a chance to ask an expert. “Tell me,” Piłsudski intoned, “What is the thrust of the Surrealists? Or of Khlebnikov?”\n\n“Breton and his clique attempt to capture that dark but true quality of nightmares,” Witkacy answered. “Khlebnikov distills meaning from the roots of the Russian language, crafting neologisms to be more... evocative. But whatever you think of them, the Surrealists see you as some great Gog to tear down the temples dedicated to the past.”\n\nThe Marshal snorted. “I shit and piss like everyone else. I have done great things but I am not their savior; I am no demigod.”\n\n“Not if Stanisław Szukalski has anything to say about it,”  Witkacy retorted.\n\nThe two men said their goodbyes, and Pilsudski was left to his contemplation in the room. He juggled these strange men and their ideas in his head, but each piece fell one by one from his consideration. He couldn't spare much mind these days, only the old friends stuck. As if on cue, Feliks Dzierżyński entered the room and made an open-armed gesture of greeting.\n\n“Marshal. I have been delegating security enforcement to the Husarzy Śmierci, but matters of the general policy remain in my hands. Hunting season is on.”\n\n“Very well. We may have transitioned messily from warfare into politics, but at least we can bring along the cavalry.”\n\nDzierżyński looked at the painting, then turned to Pilsudski with a smile. “I see Witkacy depicted you well.

Things were not so bad with him yet, but he sensed that he would die before long. He felt like an old dog or bison that, in order not to be a burden to his herd, removed himself into a corner... It was not a pleasant feeling, but he knew that this was the order of things. He set about writing his last will and testament. He was good when it came to severe and formal things, but he decided to write in a less traditional style.\n\n“I, Józef Piłsudski, born in 1867, have lived for almost 80 years on this damned planet. 80 years in service of Poland, and it’s still not enough. I joined the one party that wished to fight, only to have to split it and take the worthwhile people with me. I led legions of Poles in the Great War, fighting for independence, and let it be known - I succeeded. I succeeded, I took this country away from whores. Whores in the Sejm, whores who worked alongside the greatest threat, whores trying to dismantle my beloved Poland. I stood on the pyramid of minds, piercing the clouds of superstition, I showed everyone what’s possible, and I became the greatest man. And now even life itself is working against me. If life wishes to be another whore, then so be it! I have to realize my plans for the Commonwealth, and I’ll do so regardless of whether or not life itself wants it! But what if I don’t have enough time? I’m old, my health is worsening by the day… Oh God, what will happen to Poland when I’m gone? What if I lose any ability to lead the state? What if it dies once more? What of my legacy? Will anyone remember? Will they start lying about me? I did so much, I did what I could, all for her. Is it enough?\n\nEven if death claims me soon, what options does Poland have? I could probably just write down “If I die, I wish for Walery Sławek to succeed me”. After all, he is the closest man to my vision and a good friend of mine. There’s also Ignacy Daszyński, a bit of an idiot, but he and his men might secure my legacy through a popular mandate. There is Dzierżyński, my old school buddy and bloodthristy hound. I hope he is not going to choke on his own glove… And finally, there’s Edward Rydz-Śmigły, but who knows what his political views are… Still, he’s a good man, and I doubt my legacy will be forgotten with him at the helm.\n\nAs for Szukalski, ZNR, Witkacy, Futurists, and Cat, I don’t even want to think about them. I want my successor to be someone I know is reliable, someone I fought with against the occupiers. While they helped me build a new Poland, they don’t know what I truly wish for."

Even before the ceremony had officially begun, a blanket of mournful silence had fallen across the streets and avenues of Warsaw. The national flag was flown at half-mast alongside black flags of mourning on governmental and private buildings alike. The mourners came in the tens of thousands, likewise wearing black somewhere on or all over their person. They flocked to the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, where the Marshal’s body remained on public display, that the weeping crowds might give their farewells. Some wept, some stood silent, and more than a few gave the new polish salute, raising an arm with all fingers folded except for the middle and index. Overseen and guarded by the military, not one incident blemished the sanctity of the occasion. A day later, the funeral mass was administered personally by Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski, once more without interruption or incident. It was as though all the struggle and turmoil across the nation had paused, just for one instant, to mourn the Marshal. Indeed, despite all that she faced, Poland seemed to be united. One might even say Poland was truly whole if only in its grief and respect for the Marshal’s passing. Upon concluding the mass, Piłsudski’s mortal remains were carefully transported by train, with a full honor guard in tow, towards his final resting place in Krakow, within the Crypt of St. Leonard on Wawel.\n\nIt was there that solemnity gave way to outrage, upon the following day. In a shocking turn of events, Cardinal Sapihea ordered that Piłsudski's were to be moved elsewhere within the Cathedral, inside the Crypt of the Silver Bells. Without consulting or seeking permission from the government, or seemingly anyone else for that matter. When the news broke, the reaction was nothing short of fury, boiling and acidic. To move the Marshal from his magnificent repose as if he were nothing more than cheap furniture to be shunted to and fro? Though governmental and church authorities immediately tried to stymie the outpour of anger lest it boil over, it was in vain. Catholic parishes across the capital soon found furious bands of indignant young students and veteran legionaries all thoroughly enamored with the Marshal, ready to prove it through assaulting those they deemed as responsible for insulting his memory so soon after his passing. Street battles were soon a common sight between those outraged at the violence against the clergy and those determined to preserve the Marshal's dignity in death. Left without a choice, lest public anger grow too great, the ZBSR made a final ultimatum, threatening to nationalise the cathedral entirely, and to strip the Cardinal of every last scrap of influence should he not relent. Balking at the prospect, the Cardinal submitted at last. Crowds turned out across the country to celebrate this reversal and victory for Piłsudski's memory, cheering long into the night and beyond."

He could not shake off the disappointment at the rewards he and his men received for their contributions to the war effort against the Russians. Every collaborator they picked on the road received more enough territory to equate a fortune, but Poland’s elite units were to become the caretakers of endless swathes of wilderness.\n\nWho to talk to about this but his old friend, Łukasz Siemiątkowski? Of all the men in Poland that he knew, it was him that could give him much needed advice. He arrived at Siemiatkowski’s compound and nodded at the guards. Quickly let in, he headed straight to Lukasz’s office. His friend quickly read his face and got to cheering him up.\n\n“This is just unfair!”, screamed Jozef. “I told Szendzielarz and Rajs about our new posting and they were just as angry as I was. How could they do this to us?”\n\n“Jozef, friend.”, calmly replied Lukasz. “You fail to see the wider picture here. That wilderness you talk about has many riches to be found for those who know where to look.” Lokietek was all ears. “There’s all sorts of resources there. Oil, steel, chromium ... uranium. Think about the profits and the leverage! In a few years, all will want uranium for their nuclear plants and you will be its king! All you have to do is rebuild what the Russians already had there and make it bigger!”\n\n“You’re right, yes...How foolish of me to reject this gift! Yes, finally, our own piece of land. For many years I told our men how one day we would sprint like our Sarmatian ancestors across the plains of Central Asia. No authority to pester us, no rules to whisper in our ears telling us what to do. A new golden age!”\n\nJozef suddenly gained back his spirit. He forgot how just a few minutes ago he was traversing between anger and desperation. He could see his dreams materialising in front of his eyes: The wild expanse. His sarmatians roaming on their iron horse. The bandits they would punish for their insubordination. Yes, this was what they have been waiting for all along.\n\nJozef then turned to the friend who once again proved his worthiness. “Lukacs, you’ve been by my side. And the Hussars’s, too! You deserve compensation. I know, yes! You will receive your share of the riches we will reap beyond the Urals. It is only fair.”\n\nLukacs could only accept his friend’s offer with a smile that brazenly expressed both his appreciation towards his friend and the prospect of the coming opportunities ahead.

What should the Hussars’ role be in the future?\n\nFirstly, we could settle them into a stable secret police. The political scene is still full of unruly elements that would use any opportunity at hand to chip away at the country’s stability and our power. Killing all attempts at terrorism in their infancy would save resources, but most importantly the lives of our citizens.\n\nSecondly, there have been calls to integrate them into our army. A secret police is the last thing a civilised nation like Poland needs. Instead of sending them to hunt whatever cell of malcontents, the army could finally receive proper instruction into its duty and discipline. This sounds comical at first, but the Hussars’ patriotism and their methods could give us the edge over the Russians’ own savagery.\n\nBut there’s also the third option, let them be.

Maybe not necessarily as a kindred spirit but an absolute Quixote, someone with no regard for their conscience or the nagging obsession with “the normal” of the mob.

Feliks Dzierżyński put out his cigarette, he sniffled as he looked around the room, seemingly sizing up his audience.\n\n“Piłsudski was weak.”\n\nA few higher ups within the ZBSR audibly gasped. It was a peculiar choice of word, weak? Many of his detractors have called him brutish, harsh, power-hungry, but weak? Nobody in their right mind would think that, let alone say it out loud, yet there sat Dzierżyński, having said just that.\n\n“Let's look at the facts. There’s still organisations outside the party, a whole opposition we can point to. There are active threats to national security perusing our streets, and his weakness is to blame.”\n\nHe paused for a moment, a group of aristocrats in the middle of the hall stared at him, some in abject disgust, others with pure malice.\n\n“That’s not even to mention his failure to deliver all those grand land reforms. Great fat landowners still obstruct our vision, large swathes of the countryside, in fact, are completely blind to us, unless you take the word our good friends here in the audie-”\n\n“Don’t you DARE speak of OUR Naczelnik like that! You have NO idea what he sacrificed for our country, and for you for that matter! And you throw all of that away, how DARE you.”\n\nThe group of aristocrats were now vertical. Feliks looked on, his face still devoid of any emotion. He sighed, stood up, and signaled for security to get involved. As the men were dragged out of the room The Naczelnik took a deep breath, and sat back in his chair. For a moment there was that same strange silence, then Feliks smirked:\n\n“He was of course, also a very strong man. Without him we wouldn’t be here,” he gestured towards the exit, “and they, there.”\n\n“It was he who got us this far, but far isn’t all the way; Poland deserves all of what Piłsudski wanted, not just what he accomplished. As your new Naczelnik, I can proudly announce that I will see to this myself. This time, all the way to the finish line.”"

It was filled with his sculptures, his work and old monuments, outdated paintings thrown into unmemorable corners. There was so much ahead of him and so much on his shoulders, but he was still confident that he could lift it with his strength. A day, two, he couldn't remember how much more precisely had passed since they had subjected the three men to public execution by dropping them into a sea of drawn knives.\n\n\"You are a great artist, you are an even greater visionary Stanislaw, but tell me - Do you want Poland to become the same as France? A desperate burst of energy that will quickly go out? Marshal Piłsudski had a plan and a vision of action and this is what Artaud lacks.... Let's not kid ourselves, you lack it too.\"\n\nShukalski patted his Papakha on his head, they were on the second floor, everything should be warm, but he felt a penetrating chill that touched him to the core. He touched a stone with his shoe, which lay in shards of glass. He bent down, broke through the window and opened up a view of the red-hot street. Veterans and swarthy youths were jumping at each other's throats; Accusations of treason and of clericalism. Zadruga was crumbling in its foundations, Poland on the brink of civil war. Red-flagged workers provoked one and other, seeing that they could benefit. Both Dzerzhinsky and the Death Hussars would slip through their fingers and crush the Veterans, Students and Zadruga itself. Felix sank to the ground, waiting for the moment to strike.\n\n\"If you don't have a plan then surely Piasecki will. Solutions perfect for every eventuality. Szukalski... Think our design will turn against us, against you, you will lose power and be forgotten. Go away as a hero, go away as the one who overthrew the authority of Judeo-Christianity over the Polish soul and not the one who caused it to consolidate its position.\"\n\nStachniuk put his hand on Szukalski's shoulder; He was about to say - \"So what's it going to be,\" but fell silent when he felt Stanislaw get up from his kneeling and stop to watch the chaos happening before his eyes.

Zadruga had not yet dared to raise its hand against the bishops and cardinals, not wanting to risk an international crisis; August Hlond was merely being held in Bereza Kartuska. Jan Stachniuk continued his speech before a crowd of soldiers situated in a clearing, close to the trees and even closer to the rushing forest stream. It was a beautiful day, but the Commander-in-Chief wanted everyone to look closely at the faces of the gagged priests.\n\n\"Traitors, dwarves of reaction, who gloated with power over the government of souls and thought they could steer and direct the historical fate of Poland! The unprincipled sympathisers of the Rozwadowski-Januszajtis Rebellion of 1926, agents of Moscow and lackeys of the Vatican. All were accused of one thing - treason and subversive actions against the National Collective and deceiving the people from the National Truth! Today we are gathered here to pass the final verdict, so I ask you people, fellow believers in the vitalist truth - what should we do with them?\"\n\nIt was certain, more than certain, what would happen to them when the torches touched their bodies, which smelled tellingly of oil. Stachniuk stood on the platform presenting himself as the Emperor of ancient times and the 'Divi Filus' whose right it was to decide life and death. Soldiers, veterans of the Polish Legions, roving young men, random passersby shouted only two short sentences; \"Let the fires digest them! Let them taste the Hell they promised us!\" Stachniuk continued with a brief gesture as the soldiers at the poles began their preparations.\n\n\"There is a well-known custom in our culture, the Burning of Marzannas; the Harsh Goddess of Winter which is a symbol of the start of a new season. There was also a custom, now forgotten, practiced by Tadeusz Kościuszko and other giants of Polishness, which was the hanging of traitorous bishops of Targowica. There was also a time when the Polish people, in the guise of Jakub Szela, inflicted punishment on people like them. Will we honor our ancestors and affirm our customs if we do not burn them on the pyres they prepared for themselves?\"\n\n“Raze them with fire!” He raised his hands and zoldiers approached the poles.

At least he would do it with dignity and return to creating, having once been part of something bigger. Now he was on the rostrum, all eyes on him, for the end of his great performance: the end of King Krak's reign. The radio reporters set up their microphones, and a flash of cameras illuminated his face as the Zadrugists performed the Fiumanist hail towards him. He weighed the words, his tongue tapping his palate, his lips.\n\n\"Dear comrades, loyal to the pagan faith of your ancestors and the creed of revolutionary nationalism! The moment has come, the time of transition and the time of stability has arrived. We are moving from a feudal past into a revolutionary future, for we have overthrown the rule of inept old men who were servants of capitalist interests and of the clerical elite that infested our country like a disease. My duty has been completed.\"\n\nWhispers between journalists and guests filled the hall. Piasecki, Hempel, Stachniuk and their allies remained silent. They held their open hands high in suspense until Chief Stachniuk had finished his speech.\n\n\"That is why I am resigning from the position of Chief. I bless Jan Stachniuk as my successor and hope that the ZBSR will elect him. He is the thinker that Poland needs, and will stabilize our country after a radical transformation...\"\n\nThe press murmurs grew louder, and a cascade of camera flashes followed. Radios in all corners of the country and in every car played Szukalski's speech and all hearts froze.\n\n\"Rise up, Jan Stachniuk!\"\n\nThe philosopher approached the rostrum with a calm step. He was wearing an elegant white shirt different from the extravagant attire of Szukalski, adorned with a Horned Heart. He had the right as a nominee to make his speech, and he knew that no one would oppose him, as it would amount to passing a death sentence on himself.\n\n\"I thank Stanislaw Szukalski for his dedication to his country and for anointing me as his successor. It was a surprise, but one of the more pleasant ones. I promise you a laconic government that gets to the heart of the matter without mincing words. My hand will tighten its noose on the larynx of street anarchy, in the name of the national collective.

He closed his eyes, but did not die, but ascended to greatness in the heavens and reunited with his father: the Swiatowid!\"\n\nThe mad prophet began his great speech in front of St Mary's Church at the heart of the Eucharist. He was carried on a lectern by four young men, adorned in a Sarmatian kontusz and topped with a helmet that was more befitting of the Aztecs than anything drawn from medieval Europe. He positioned himself on a simple box and, gesticulating vigorously, roused the crowds and drew the God-fearing faithful out from under the power of the old cleric's sermon. His speech was curious and unusual and his voice so booming that even the church pulpit could not drown it out; he spoke in the language of fire.\n\n\"The Marshal is in our midst, and he is fire, and he is spirit, and he is the power of thunder! He is the Polish Hercules and I am his follower, and you should be his followers too! I tell you, I will demolish Wawel!

They whispered among themselves, and were frightened to see the newcomer who had come late and from a bygone era to awaken the drowsy Poles with his speech.\n\n\"And I will build you a Temple in which you will pay homage to Piłsudski. And I will build you a Tower of Babel soaring over the horizon that you will see in the land of corn. In three days I will build highways and lay asphalt, I will do what no other prophet has done. For I am not speaking of a temple of a dead body, but about the living organism that is the nation! Life and death for the nation!\"\n\nThey did not understand his speech so far, for they did not know that his speech was about the road, about the current, about the monuments and about the nation; but they perceived in the scraps of his words a lwisdom which they had not heard in any of the Churches.\n\n\"'Hail Piłsudski; for he is the only one who has not died, but is still alive and endures for ever!

In the middle of it, at the level of Jesus' heart was a bullet hole. Possession of religious objects was not banned in Poland, at least not yet, but the government did look down on signs of Catholic worship. Andrzej feared, with growing certainty, that one of his friends or at least neighbors would report him to the authorities. He was a veteran of the First Winkelried War, only seventeen when he joined the army at the time - he lied about his maturity. He was a young communist then, though he was still one to a certain extent. Engels, after all, said that Christianity was socialism in the Roman Empire, and Rosa Luxemburg approved the Red Concordat...\n\nDuring the Kharkov expedition, he was shot by a Russian bullet. A 7.63×25mm Mauser to be exact. His mother told him to put a holy picture in his uniform, which now stood framed in front of him. He was reluctant. During the battle, the bullet pierced the image of Christ and crushed ribs, but then miraculously stopped before it reached his heart. From that day on, he converted.\n\nHe was not against Piłsudski's laïcisme, as it was a sensible policy, but Zadruga's furious attack on the Church caused him a sense of trepidation. Pagan  harvest festivals and feasts were celebrated in front of every parish. Newspapers promoted theories about Christ's alternative origins to belittle him. After his mother's death, he was the only one in the family to persevere in his faith - his father became a staunch supporter of Hempel. His friend and fellow veterans were leaving the churches and he felt as if he was sitting in the middle of nowhere in the cathedral.\n\nMen and women dressed as pagan deities now paraded in front of his house. He folded his arms and hid his head in the pads of his fingers. He glanced through the prism of his hands at the image of Christ and at the table next to the crucifix and next to the picture. There was a chess game there. He was playing against... a Vis wz.35 pistol, and he was losing against it.\n\n\"Oh Lord; Give me strength because I will do something terrible.”\n\nAs strong as the temptation to join the ungodly Homen that circled his home was, he was so strongly tempted to turn the gun against himself or go on a lone crusade against the whole world that had turned to Gog and Magog. To be a Christian in those days one would have to be a fool... Perhaps his miracle was a mere coincidence, or he deserved to perish Kharkov as scum to his fatherland.

This was... an ashtray from Biała, with a swastika engraved on it and a cross ending in a horizontal line on each side of the crucifix.\n\nHowever, this was not what caught Marcille's attention. She was more interested in the statue of a large sasquatch-like entity with a Christian cross hanging from it, painted on the wall behind the urn and surmounted by a brave Slavic warrior in armour in a style confusingly similar to art deco. It certainly could not have been an archaeological monument.\n\n\"Ah yes! The government said it would make the exhibition more attractive. This pavilion is to showcase Poland's long historical heritage and its bright future.\"\n\nSo said the exhibition curator, who was standing by Marcille commenting on the works. It was clearly a recitation, but he was ready to polemicize.\n\n\"Oh, that is certain, but what exactly is the bigfoot supposed to represent?\"\n\n\"Stanislaw Szukalski was inspired by American art, both indigenous and post-Columbian, in his vision. The Yeti is nothing more than a symbol of backwardness and of the Muscovites.\"\n\n\"But, did not Christianity give your nation the opportunity to form statehood?\"\n\n\"Jan Stachniuk would disagree. Christianity with its slave mirality led Poland to its downfall. The Piast monarchy merely persisted by force. Wasn't Boleslaw the Bold exiled because he wanted to stop the conspiracy of the clergy? Christianity creates an ideomatrix that forces people to abandon their being in the name of personalism and sanctimoniousness.\"\n\nMarcille reflected; she was not interested in politics, but could see some truth in this. She had been afraid to come to Poland at first, listening to rumors of violent pogroms triggered by the change of power and the death of the Speaker, but the Zadruga government had been true to its promises. Entering Krakow, she could see the Wawel Castle being rebuilt and a huge statue piled up above the Kościuszko Mound. If anything was to prove the greatness of the Zadruga idea, it was the symbol of action.\n\n\"Truly it is an interesting sight, but why a Yeti?\"\n\nThe curator visibly tried to maintain an air of seriousness through his spiel.\n\n\"Szukalski believes the Yetis are the fruit of the Yeti's rape of humans and they rule the world and the Poles are supposed to lead the crusade against them.\"\n\nShe was slammed with realization and burst out laughing."

We recognize you do not agree with our long-term agenda for Poland, but you and I once were comrades in the PPS, We must have some common ground.”  “And what projects would those be?” “We are thinking of regulating some of the most egregious clerical behaviors and privileges, the ones that every Pole secretly curses in his heart, and also some infrastructure projects like bridges and railroads and such.”\n\nDaszysniki thought it over. It seemed to be within reason, but he would have to watch out for Hempel exposing his true colors later.  On the other hand, Hempel's distance from the normative institutions that were the backbone of Polish society for thousands of years would look bad for him if it came out that they were political allies. Besides, he had enough faith in his own party. Even if they weren't that many in number their belief in Polish democracy was good enough for him."

 poland.2000.d:0 "The most recent article of Tajny Detektyw aroused more outrage than the last; an achievement most thought impossible. Aimed, if such a rag could have such purpose and drive to aim, at the government. There was the horrible outstretched body of a girl, splayed across a bed, blood staining the light sheets, her mouth agape, almost in a grin, milky eyes yet with a hint of joy. She was beautiful, even in her state. Oh, and what tragedy had befallen the poor girl! A few trysts with an up and coming officer ended with the man stabbing her in her bed after he discovered she had charmed another. He thought she had loved him, they were to be married. He was also the son of an imprint at figure in Sancja, she the daughter of a worker.\n\nIt was really a romantic tale, written in a simplistic, yet appealing prose, it’s rather purple tone was no doubt disguised by the simple horror of the scene above it. It was to be a marriage the kind of which most desired by the current regime, cut short by all too human passions.The writing made the act seem almost admirable; the Skamandryci have lauded it, many more artists have, either in jealousy or awe, referenced the article in conversation or their work. Tajny Detektyw is a sensation, it’s every new, horrific, pornographic issue awaited with baited breath by the men of taste of this country.\nWithin Sanacja, it is a byword for everything wrong with Polish thought. It is Freudian, they seethe, an outlet, something that shouldn’t exist for the good of society. They castigate it as a reflection of a proletarian culture borne of slums and prisons, a rag that one would expect bourgeois women in countries afar to read greedily and guiltily, not supposed revolutionaries. Alluding to the recent article, they also claim the magazine is run by anti-regime forces bent on slandering Sanacja and “making tragicomedy of its workers personal lives”.Many in the police forces claim that the articles spur more than mere artistic emulation, but that many criminals seemingly audition for the articles by making their crimes ever more brazen, grandiose, and brutal.\n\nCuriously, this magazine has come into state ownership, and thus, we play an instrumental role in its output. The artist allies of the regime have begged us to keep it in circulation, arguing that it utilizes terrible acts in such a beautiful way as to give it artistic merit. Most Sanacjists have called for the end of its publication, and the police have requested that its writers be sent in for questioning, alluding to their being potential accomplices to their subjects. Whatever the case, it is clear we must make some kind of call regarding this obscene periodical."

 poland.2001.t:0 "General Sweetheart"
 poland.2001.d:0 "General Bolesław Długoszowski personifies the “New Revolutionary Man” that has emerged under the Sanation regime. Serving alongside the Naczelnik during the Revolution, he emerged as a war-hero and highly respected General, serving as Pilsudki’s adjutant as well as the head of the Military for a brief period. As the regime slowly solidified, the General threw himself headfirst into the material delights of contemporary Warsaw; his home became a literary salon, a refuge for trysts, and a receptacle for all manner of up-and-coming wunderkinds. Długoszowski’s increasingly prodigal activities were masked by philanthropic acts equal or even greater in extravagance, and an unswerving loyalty to the Party.\n\nWith a single article from a half-rate newspaper, seemingly everything has been revealed. The  story is littered with images of the General traipsing about Warsaw’s most fashionable districts with a dizzying array of women. Coupled with short blurbs describing the women and their daily activities, are various bills surreptitiously collected from the innumerable boutiques, restaurants, and jewelry stores patronized by Długoszowski and his girlfriends. The write-up details eye-popping sums: thousands of zlotys on French necklaces and mink, kegs of alcohol imported from across the continent, endless arrays of complex, rare delicacies, earning the jealousy of even the most seasoned connoisseurs and cosmopolitans in the country from mere description.\n\nThe article released exactly one week ago, and has since been picked up by every major paper, with the exception of those most intimately connected with the military top brass or Sanacja. This is not due to Długoszowski’s maneuverings, however. If anything, the General seems to be enjoying his time in the spotlight, with interviews in various gossip rags solidifying his caddish image, while also earning him legions of tender admirers, mostly female. “I have been good to every women I have encountered,” has become his catch phrase. “Yet they still slander me”. Has become his coy refrain.\nDługoszowski’s critics have largely let the man and his myth speak for itself. While he may have admirers now, his habits, they warn, will inevitably bring him to ruin. Yet, the increased publicity has not only given the General a chance to renew his celebrity; he has become an icon. The legions of new, young libertines have taken Długoszowski as a patron-saint; with many publicly dedicating their works and orgies in his name. "

He only nodded his head and acquiesced whenever that parched angel of the State before him elaborated on the ways to lead him out of his disgrace.\n\n- First, we have to put you on a diet, citizen. No more vodka or sweets, the doctors will take good care of that. Then, some good exercise and maybe we will make a man out of you!\n\nAs the official descended into further details of the health camp’s technicalia, Jankowski’s gaze turned to the portrait of the grand dictator above him. He felt angry at the State for stripping him bare in shame and forcing him to run in circles like a trained dog. Yet the subtle smile of the man in the painting, of the omnipresent face which looked at him from every edifice of his city perplexed him.\n\nDid this man really love him? Did he really wish to see him strong and healthy, not just as cannon fodder, but as a new human being?\n\n- And remember, this is all for your good, citizen Jankowski - finished the official - because comrade Dzierżyński loves us all.

He had called him in again, to that little office with the bizarre paintings and comfortable, stiff chairs. Josef wanted to spit in his eye, but then he would be placed on social work duty again, and Josef hated that more than he hated the Miniuve man.\n\n“I see you’re angry, know that impotent rage only serves to engender further ill-feeling—“\n“You do that well enough yourself!”\nJosef spat. The Miniuve man went quiet, with a ridiculous wry smirk stretching across his maw. He turned, pulling out a pen and paper, jotting down some notes. Josef thought about leaving, of buffeting the man’s exposed head. But he merely sat, glaring as the Miniuve man set aside his notes.\n“Josef, I believe I have had you mistaken. You are not a depressive, or delusional, or truly antisocial.”\nThe Miniuve man’s tone had changed. For the past four meetings, his voice had never assumed anything approaching the frank, sharp tone that he assumed. Josef was taken aback somewhat, though he did his best not to show it.\n“Yes, I think I have you down. You are merely unpleasant. You worked too much, and saw the worst of everyone. You have only ever had liaison with those whom you despise; you told me about your mother., about those criminals, of course on of whom was the reason why you are here.”\n“That kid deserved a good beating, evidently his probably absent father never administered any, with how he squealed. I did something kind to that boy, really, and they call me a brute! The nerve of you people!

The man’s visage was impassive. Josef was a little unnerved at how rapidly his whole comport had shifted.\n“This camp is not a simple prison, Josef. Have a drink.”\nThe Miniuve man pulled out a bottle. Josef lit up.\n“This whole operation is meant to make men like you better, to learn to love those you beat.

They surrounded him and corrupted his vision, the Muscovite monkeys and the whitewashed Abyssinians. They locked him up in that mental institution and sentenced him to torture.\n\nStanislaw Szukalski was sentenced to exile to his \"personal Elba\" in the form of the Choroszcz Psychiatric Hospital. He was isolated from his family and could only listen from time to time; as he thought, to a recorded message on the telephone and not to his wife. His company was kept by Sonia, a nurse with her legs spread too wide. He was in the room alone when the nurse came in with a meal.\n\n\"I demand to be able to talk to Joan! Poland needs me!

He dismissed her hand and the woman cringed away. Szukalski stepped away from her and tucked back the map, carefully folding it.\n\n\"This means, that as a civic duty, you will help your Wódz meet his wife and help them organize their escape together!\"\n\nThe nurse was disappointed when he returned to the meal she had brought and began to consume it. Soon he was pulling his notes from under the bed to return to work,  whispering the word “Zermat” to himself.

Not so long ago he was still standing next to Piasecki, whose skull had shattered into a million shrapnel shells - He feared he would be next. That devil Hempel had disappeared - He was unable to confront him, but every territorial unit was almost given over to anarchy and had ceased contact with the national government. There was indeed a spirit of anarchy in Poland which terrorized everything and everyone like a vampire bent on revenge and blood.

Failure would doom not only him, his plans, his men, but also Poland itself. Szukalski couldn’t be allowed to continue ruling, and God knows how bad the situation in the country will get if he rules alone. Stachniuk and Hempel, on the other hand, while better than Szukalski, were far from desirable. Bolesław knew what he had to do all along. Szukalski was a gateway - whereas he is the way itself.

Normally, it’d be their own foreign minister, but this was no formal ocassion. The Poles mobilised to welcome their foreign minister. He had to show them that Lithuania won’t cower to their attitude.\n\nJust thinking about this fiasco was enough to make his head spin. He was close to calling for a chair to sit when the train from Warsaw finally entered the station. Just as it stopped, Beck descended and shook Grinius’ hand.\n\n“Your Excellency, I’m glad to meet you. I say we urgently move to address the situation at hand.” Grinius could not agree more.\n\nThe official car began its drive to the Presidential Palace. Grinius and Beck agreed not to wave to the gathered civilians. They barely calmed down when news broke of Beck’s arrival that day. President Grinius could only hope things would stay that way, and it seemed Beck was agreeing. Then, the chants began.\n\nIt was a cacophony of Polish and Lithuanian at start, but then Vilnius’ Polish majority made itself known. “Heil! The Great Poland!”, “Lead Us To Kaunas!” and more were coming from all directions. Pancarts proclaiming Poland’s unity were being raised for Jozef Beck to see. His name was being chanted like a mantra. After all these weeks of fighting against the Lithuanians, the Polish motherland sent its prodigal son to deliver salvation to her sons, it seemed.\n\nThe car entered the Presidential Palace, leaving the populace behind. Grinius, however, couldn’t forget the scene. What was Beck thinking about all of this? Who did Poland side with? His government tried its best, he surely could tell that. Lithuania’s fate was at stake and Grinius could only fear the worst. Will history books remember him as the man who sold away his nation?"

Smiling, Beck was glad to announce a joint approach was decided upon, which will be announced to the troubled Lithuanians immediately.\n\nThe gathered people waited all day for the solution to their woes, and now they were finally going to hear it from the balcony of the Presidential Palace. Beck and Grinius, Pole and Lithuanian, greeted the crowd together. In the cheers of the excited population, Beck spoke first:\n\n“We, Poles and Lithuanians, have a long shared history. We triumphed and suffered together across centuries. Just two decades ago, we regained our independence together, and we will defend it together. The events in Vilnius were not an omen to our future, but a test to our friendship. This is why I came all the way here not as a Polish satrap, but as an ally and comrade of yours. Together with the Lithuanian government, we have agreed on a common plan of action.”\n\nBeck retreated, letting President Grinius to speak. “Dear Lithuanians,”, he began. “These past weeks have shown us the incessant need for reason and understanding among each other. We must not let radicals tear apart the peace. This is why Minister Beck has arrived here today. Lithuanian and Pole, we must shed our differences aside and reach an understanding. We are not enemies. Minister Beck is here to work with us and aid us in conducting negotiations with all sides involved in these unfortunate events.”\n\n“Poles, brothers!”, spoke Beck again. “I am here to speak in your name. There is nothing to fear! The Lithuanians have agreed to negotiations and peace, but only as long as we commit to it as well. Brothers! Lay down your arms and extend the hand of peace to the Lithuanians! Give peace a chance!”\n\nBeck’s gambit paid off, to his relief. Suddenly, enemies turned into friends once again. Hostility was laid down. Beck would be sending a great report back home, knowing that tonight, he was the man that saved Poland, Lithuania, and the Intermarium."

What can the murmurings of our countrymen teach us?\n\nPilsudksi was perhaps the most democratic world leader in history; his revolution included all of the progressive social classes and united them not through violence or threats, but through the common bonds of patriotism and brotherhood. When it started, Sanacja was a firm break with the reactionary or bourgeois regimes elsewhere, incorporating workers' Unions as a central pillar of the Party, as well as making land reform its driving policy on all matters rural. It stood against the deleterious Reactionary elements and the superstitions of the Church and its minders.\n\nWhile Pilsudski died, his ideal lives! It resides in the hearts of the workers, the dreams of the youth, the ideals that drove Poland time and time again to tear off its chains. It pushes the inventor, the scientist, and the artist to thrust upon the world their creations and irrevocably change reality and the mind.

The prices of goods are not controlled by unscrupulous capitalists and speculators, but by the objective, rational networks of computers adjusting prices in real time for maximal efficiency and welfare; wages of workers are not set by bosses seeking to squeeze as much blood and sweat from them, but by committees of workers and planners co-operating in harmony for a better future.

To some on our more radical wing this will sound like a pointless entanglement with incurably backwards forces. We say that our Party’s future is based on cooperation with compatible allies.

Now, in conjunction with our partners in the People’s Party, we can properly address the question of land reform from a socialist and peasant perspective.

Everywhere we see the trace influences of local notables and other caste-like structures with no place in a modern, socialist economy. And even worse, we see promising candidates passed over for jobs or positions within the workplace by reason of their political affiliation - or even lack thereof! While we cannot yet fully unwind the ZBSR and its auxiliary, the Union of Trade Unions, it must be made clear that the socialist Polish economy of the future is of and for every Pole, regardless of race or language.

We will continue and expand existing efforts to reinforce Poland’s domestic military industry, both through investment and by directly funding research. Even if we can’t match Petrograd soldier for soldier, the defenders of Poland will be better equipped and better provisioned. To lay the foundations for a military consistent with our vision of Poland, we will also begin to establish popular militia units.

 POL_give_me_the_reign_of_souls_desc:0 "Our rule shall embrace all of Poland! Away with Zadruga and their pawns! Nobody is against us! A new total state shall embrace the whole of Polish society. The youth and the artists will be its new vanguard. Sanacja's architecture will embrace the primordial surrealist spirit. The new state will be Art, Religion and Philosophy, the new state will be everything."

 POL_the_holy_creed_of_amarna_desc:0 "Only a fool would believe that Christianity destroyed the ancient ideal. It was in fact Hellenism, with its tales of petty gods with petty disputes, that brought a decay to this world. This vicious path can be walked back however, to the times of Pharaoh Akhenaton. It is silly to think a revival of ancient paganism will take place in Poland, what we truly seek is a reformation of our Christianity in the shape of its ideal, back to its roots, with no structure, full of spontaneity."

 POL_the_tyrant_of_beauty_desc:0 "Many bugmen have tried to define beauty to their own standards, ascribe it their own beliefs. What a foolish endeavour that is, as beauty can be found anywhere, in goodness and truth, in cruelty and repulsiveness. Beyond good and evil, beyond left or right, our government seeks one thing - beauty. Smigly is the personification of this endeavor. He is a caring father to his loyal children and a vengeful god to his enemies. He is, rightfully so, a son of Mars, a Tyrant of Beauty."

The new shape of the world must rearrange the lands it has conquered, build where until now death walked. The new Golden Age can now begin, the Age of mighty rulers, beautiful men and wonderful artists!"

 POL_insatiability_of_our_lust_desc:0 "We are honest to ourselves: conquest is like a drug. We have developed an addiction to warfare, to expanding our dominion across the globe, to subjugating lower men to our rule. The greatest enemy of Poland has been defeated for good, but where to go now but to expand our reach across the whole world!"

From Vistula to the Pacific, ample rituals shall bring our way to the men over which our flag flies! From the Caucasus to Siberia, extraction of resources shall re-commence immediately! Poland is walking into the new age of myth, and it will do so properly prepared!"

The solution is easy for men like us, let them be as long as they keep the peace. Eventually they will learn to live under our yoke, even if it might take some time and effort to reach that point."

Prometheus has been liberated by the hand of the individual, not by the petty statelets that we rule over. Legends will be told of our glories long after we passed, by men seeking to surpass our achievements and reach beyond the stars and the sky. We can only imagine what will come after our Endeavour, but know it will be just as great as our own struggle."
