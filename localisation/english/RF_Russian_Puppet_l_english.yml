 TER.1.t:0 "To Crown a Tsar"
 TER.1.d:0 "After centuries of humiliation, finally... Poland no longer the beaten dog of Europe. Never again! Poland has fulfilled its historic duty. Gaude Mater Polonia! You have gained the status of Empire that you so richly deserved. However, if we had slaughtered Moscow like the Muscovites slaughtered the Praga of Warsaw, would we not have become just like the Muscovites? Therefore, we will give the Russians the opportunity to present to us people who can represent them.\n\nThree collaborating parties have come together in Moscow. Bronislav Kaminsky, Vasily Biskupsky and Yuri Mirolubov. Each of them has his own personal vision for Russia after our victory. We have allowed the formation of the 'Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia', which will prepare the foundations for the 'Nowy Porządek' under our watchful eye.\n\nBronislav Kaminsky is an opportunist. One might even use the dysphemism \"useful idiot\". A half-Pole who does not have very strongly developed views apart from support for private property.  He supported us with several hundred Russian volunteers, who were not against Russia, but against the regime. He has unfortunately carried out several massacres which may discourage the Russians from cooperating with us... But at the same time, he is clueless and will allow us to mold the new Russia as we wish. We will certainly demoscene it and resurrect the Novgorod Myth.\n\nThe second candidate is Vasily Biskupsky. The complete opposite of Kaminsky. A conservative industrialist who hates revolution with all his heart. That is why we were so surprised when he offered us a share of the Romanovs' wealth when Russia began to collapse. Piłsudski had almost introduced the Otto Neurath model before his death, which is why it was so strange that Biskupsky praised our Naczelnik to the skies. However, we suspect that, in a strange way, Vasily sees in us an opportunity to establish a Conservative Muscovite Republic free of Asian, Jewish, and Communist influence. We are grateful for his donations but suspect that when we offer him a position we will lose considerable control over how Russia will look... In return, we will get a stable and reliable ally.\n\nMirolubov's Vedists are the most unpredictable option. Jan Stachniuk and Volodymyr Shayan contacted them and highly recommended them to us! We see this as an opportunity for the greatest transformation of Russia from Muscovism, but at the same time, we will give them the illusion of control over their own government. Of course, this choice could also turn against us, as the Vedists are neo-pagans who pray to Veles. They are the wild card. Their election could pacify Russia once and for all... But it could also enrage the masses incited by the Orthodox Church.\n\nIn the end, we will have to choose someone, but this choice should be anticipated. We are already receiving numerous rumors of partisans in Russia we have conquered. If we choose the wrong option we can only worsen our situation in the West."

 TER_great_awakening:0 "The Great Awakening"
 TER_great_awakening_desc:0 "Glory! Glory to the liberators! Every man in whom the blood of Rus flows, every man who has not forgotten the legacy of the noble warriors who raised Novgorod, rise in celebration! Our Slavic brothers came, with the fierceness of their hussar ancestors in their clanking gilded bevors, to liberate us from the Asiatic rule. Sanationist heroes and men of Zadruga, putting Yahweh's slavish followers to shame, throwing his priests off their Babylonian altars right onto the rabid crowds of awakened people! A revolt of the masses is underway, right under our very own eyes— right under Veles' eyes! So dance and cheer brave bogatyr, dance, and cheer he who loves his faith and people still! If your heart still beats with Slavic blood, dance and cheer! Eastern Rus stands ready alongside the Oryans and Lechites, the Krivyans, the ancient Prussians, and the Latgales. May our brotherhood remain forever strong and our Indo-Aryan roots never again be stamped underfoot by mongrel reactionaries and Bolshevik devils. Breathe freely and enjoy the unspoiled soil, accompanied by women tending the wheat fields. Our reborn Rus shall be nothing short of a paradise."

 TER_gold_from_dust_desc:0 "Many monarchists and nationalists are lamenting the loss of their precious empire, cursing our benefactors wherever they go. We shall let them die alongside the past they hold so dear. What good were ever Siberia, Ukraine, or Zheltorossiya to the Muscovite anyway? Nothing but lead balls tied to our feet, every single one of them. Holdouts for Asians who poisoned our blood and razed our homes, Jews spreading their poisons of atheism and Judeo-Spartakism, and liberal homosexuals harboring nothing but pure and unfiltered hatred for our culture. To hell with all of them! The Poles have done us great service in melting down that rusting chain, allowing for a new Muscovy to grow alongside its allies in perfect harmony. In Piłsudski's world, every race can find its own place, and every piece of God's green earth fits exactly where it belongs. Why should we not cherish such a world? Gaze toward the sky with tears in your eyes, brother, for it is just getting started."
 TER_feast_for_crows:0 "A Feast for Crows"
 TER_feast_for_crows_desc:0 "Many of our detractors wave their fingers angrily in the air, slandering us as modern carpetbaggers here to feed on Russia's decrepit corpse. While it is true that Russia has certainly seen better days, it is also true, however, that chaos opens doors that would otherwise remain closed off forever. While our Provisional Government for the Resurrection of the Russian Nation means to eventually emulate order of our own, it would be equally impossible to deny the immense goldmine our Polish occupiers have thrown at our feet in the form of seats to fill, means to confiscate, and lands to rule over. Where old decrepit oafs sing their Slavsyas or Internationales and swear on their respective bibles to never, under any circumstances, work for the enemy, ambitious young officers are eager to move in their place and grab fate by the tail, chasing it with all the riches it can offer. Most, if not everything, of what the Unifiers forces as much as touched can easily be found with a presidential seal stamped on its rear and an eager collector willing to pay a lifetime to hold it. All this comes with a level of restraint, of course; for we are not common thieves. Not within the laws we write, anyway."
 TER_unifer:0 "Legacy of the Unifier"
 TER_unifer_desc:0 "Something's brewing within West Russia, and the results are unlikely to be pretty. For while the dreams of Prometheus stand realized and his flame burns bright from Poznan to Vladivostok, the anger of those who trembled in the Intermarium's march for progress could not die out alongside the nascent Russian state. Even now defiant whispers are coming from across the country. In Novgorod, in Moscow, in Nevsk. Few oblasts of the new statelet could pride themselves in lacking patrols going missing without a trace, shipments of arms vanishing into the night, collaborationist bureaucrats missing a leg— or head. The most optimistic in our ranks say the process of replacing Russian Peace with that of the poles has to be a long, dreadful, and demanding one. And the rest?\n\nThey can only pray it will last."
