 april_fools.36.title:0 "The Jobless Progressive Party Convention"
 april_fools.36.desc:0 "Where else could it be but in Chicago? The Jobless Progressive Party brass and supporters descended on the Second City for four days of speaking, rallying, and outlining the party platform and candidate for the 1936 election. The mood was understandably raucous, sometimes for the better, like when up-and-coming folk musician Woody Guthrie led the room in a chorus of Solidarity Forever. Sometimes, however, the jostling between progressives and outright communists could be a little pointed… That being said, everyone could largely agree on getting President Mellon out of office and implementing drastic economic and social reforms.\n\nThe Jobless Progressive Party is a broad front clustered around one man: the labor priest Father James Renshaw Cox. Cox is many things - a Roman Catholic pastor who served as a chaplain during the American intervention in France, the holder of a Masters degree in Economics, and a community organizer who has gone from setting up food and housing relief in Pittsburgh to leading a march of the unemployed on DC in the heady days of 1932. That same year, he ran for President under the new \"Jobless Party\" ticket, pursuing a program of massive public works and labor reform. Quixotic as it was, this effort became the nucleus for the Progressive Party, the Socialist Party, Republican defectors, and even the odd communist to form up around in an effort to avoid splitting the left vote. The so-called \"Pastor of the Poor\" was a shoe-in as the newly founded JPP's presidential candidate."

 april_fools.37.title:0 "The Jobless Progressive Party Convention"
 april_fools.37.desc:0 "Choosing the Vice Presidential candidate has been a more difficult matter, however. With the list narrowed down, the first candidate is Kentucky's favorite son, Nestor Makhno. One of the most visible progressives on the national stage, this ex-Republican has a record of supporting labor during his time in Congress, as well as being an early opponent of Prohibition. He's been barnstorming for the JPP on a platform of radical decentralization, land reform, and really bringing political participation to everyone in America. On the other hand, as progressive as he is, his quietly anti-Mennonite agenda and even his Ukrainian ancestry have raised concerns among the party establishment. The specter of ethnic Ukrainian secession weighs heavily upon the world.\n\nThe wildcard choice, however, is Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. The longtime labor and feminist activist would be a bold choice given… the prejudices of the time, but her credentials to the left wing of the party are impeccable. Flynn has been a socialist activist since her teen years, organizing with the International Workers of the World since the age of 17.  Additionally, she was a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union. Forged in the fire of the final years of the Wilson administration, she would advance further up the ladder of the IWW, which came to be increasingly dominated by anarchist thought as it eventually shed more high-profile communists. Flynn, more than anyone, is responsible for some of the most militant labor activists in the country throwing their support behind the JPP, and nominating her would be an impressive gesture towards the most skittish of the party's left wing, at the cost of potentially worrying the more liberal members.\n\nIn the end, Cox's choice was..."

 april_fools.38.title:0 "The Freelance Party Convention"
 april_fools.38.desc:0 "The stain of Woodrow Wilson's legacy was too dark for anything to salvage the remains of the Democratic Party. By the time his stroke-addled (and possibly deceased) body was being propped up to run for a fifth term by the grace of the Klan dead-enders who controlled the party, the fracture of the coalition had become irreversible.\n\nBut with the Republicans burning down the country and the JPP and Technocrats a little too radical, the void in American politics would be filled by another force, one that could unite the vital center with the aimless protest vote. That force was Huey Long- oh, pardon me, I'm being handed a note. It says \"to remove the dominating presence of Huey Long in most alternate-history American populists, we have seen fit to have him die to a hippo in the Mississippi.\" So the new force that came after him was the Freelance Party under so-called hyperkinetic rabbity thing Max.\n\nThere were some questions about whether this little rabbit could run for President, but all constitutional scholars and even the Supreme Court were rapidly silenced by a threatening letter bomb campaign, so people wisely learned not to ask these questions. Max's whirlwind tour of the nation under his new political vehicle has brought boosters and detractors out from under every rock, but they ARE talking about him. Decisive action against organized crime, a frankly preposterous public works campaign, an unprecedented military buildup, an outright antagonistic foreign policy, and cryptic allusions to closer ties with Canada have been promised. For a country tired of politics as usual, this has been a very welcome sight, either due to earnest belief in the merits of the party program or desire to fuck everyone else over.\n\nWith Max a shoe-in for the nomination, his VP slot easily fell to his co-conspirator and former co-worker, an anthropomorphic dog Sam."

 april_fools.39.title:0 "The Republican Party Convention"
 april_fools.39.desc:0 "Hard times demand hard men, but also sometimes they demand new ways of thinking. President Andrew Mellon's stock in the Republican Party itself had plummeted precipitously as his term progressed. Even he knew it was unlikely the night would progress without a primary challenge. That's why, two days before the event in Chicago, President Mellon announced he would stand down to let new blood take the reigns and (hopefully) boost the fortunes of the party in a country that was not ready for his genius.\n\nConfusion and elation reigned. Vice President and businessman Wendell Willkie attempted to get the party brass behind him on such short notice, but was surprised on the night of the convention to find that ANOTHER barnstorming businessman had already won them over. Someone with impeccable business credentials. Someone with a successful record in governing at the Treasury. Someone who- oh son of a bitch.\n\nWillkie seethed in the audience as Andrew Melon, an old man in a mask, claimed the nomination to unanimous assent and roaring applause."

 april_fools.40.desc:0 "With the party conventions over, it seems like the American federal election season is truly underway. It goes without saying this will have dramatic consequences for the country. The incumbency advantage of the Republican Party has been badly damaged by the failure to deal with the Great Depression, and the opposition has coalesced into three major parties promising dramatic transformation of America to address its problems.\n\nSuch a field seems crowded and likely to produce a split government again, but the electoral system of the USA is a relic made up of old compromises. The Republican Party was not favored to win in 1932 either, but the split opposition allowed them to eke out a win in the Electoral College by being merely the most popular party in the right states. If any one party can enlarge their lead over the others, there's a chance they could secure a majority in Congress as well as the presidency.\n\nThe Jobless Progressive Party, Freelance Police Party, and Technocracy, Inc. are waging the most competitive national campaigns. With the Republican Party increasingly moribund, the odds are good that a brand new party will win the presidency for the first time since Abraham Lincoln."

So Makhno was officially acting as president while he was relaxing in a hotel in Fresno. It was a scary thought, but now wasn't the time to be afraid; America needed a leader, and he was more than ready to be that leader. When he arrived back in Washington, D.C, there was no great swearing in ceremony. After a quick speech where he promised to uphold American values and make the Klan pay, he found a judge and had him swear him in, for procedure still required a ceremony. A bible and a hardcover copy of the constitution was found to swear in on, and within seconds, he was now officially president. Now it was time to act. "

One such local, a farmer simply going by the alias \"Sneed\" was responsible for the organization of one such rebellion and has made it his right to lead the now independent community, by means unknown to the american public. His friend and now political ally Chuck wasnt as enigmatic however, as many speculations arose from statements made by his person, such as \"The Nebraskan people shall never again fall to the boot of foreign city slickers and their fancy german social reactionism!\".

The overweight, anthropomorphic dog looked around the room and adjusted his blue and black striped tie. Then he placed his eyes on the little rabbit and asked:\n\n\"Hey Max, remember when I said that I join America and the rest of the free world in praying that would never happen?\"\n\n\"Well, either Allah didn't listen to you or it's the praying that never happened.\" -Max replied.\n\n\"Either way, how does it feel to be the president of the United States?\"\n\n\"Incredible!

In the blink of an eye Max ran to answer it, screaming:\n\n\"I GOT IT!

Yes! Yes! Oh, alright! Got it! You too! Goodbye!\"\n\nSam put down the phone loudly. Max quickly got up on his feet and asked:"

Not only that, he also wanted you to bring the country to prosperity and reinstate it as a great power, since that's apparently what you are supposed to do as a president.\"\n\nThe enthusiasm on Max's face turned into an aggrieved scowl. He shouted: \"Oh, come on! I didn't even get to capture all these hippos so I can dump them into Britain. Ugh… What do we have to do?\"\n\n\"Well, there's the economic depression, terrifyingly high unemployment rate, the dustbowl crippling our agriculture and...\"\n\n\"Well, this country is beyond saving.

The government was desperate to achieve \"Socialist Plenty\" in animal products, and had begun releasing generous permits to conduct massive livestock operations. Heinrich's books showed consistent excellence in resource management and he was well-liked by the local agricultural union. In other words, he would be a shoe-in for approval. The question was, did he want to take on the added stress of expansion, or just be content with his current peaceful and moderately prosperous way of life? To turn down such an offer would seem mad, but it certainly was a risk, and Heinrich debated whether or not the risk was worth it. Did he want to roll the dice on the life he loved? Or did he want to simmer down, be humble, and enjoy the gifts that he's been given?"

As his farm expanded, so did the attacks he faced. That pesky Hermann Göring and the rest of Die Tierfreunde were constantly harassing him, spitting on him, calling him a rat-faced murderer, and \"liberating\" his chickens. One day, he had enough. As he stepped out to walk to the police station and report the hooligan, he felt a great wave of force slam into his back as the ground gave way beneath him. \n\nHe woke up in a maze of mazes of green grass, the Blood of the Lamb coating the Lion's claws all around him. He did not belong, not as he was. Less than an ant, less than a worm, before this terrible might. It peered inside his soul, naming itself to him. Agartha it was, Land of Lands, heart of this world and home of the Aryan race. It enfolded him in its power, and he rose once more, out of the bosom of the earth and into the void above his chicken farm. He saw the coward Göring shaking with fear as he flew towards him, chanting the proto-proto-proto-Vedas and cursing the names of the Annunaki. He felt a bullet strike his side. As he fell to the earth, saved only by his Super Magical Aryan Healing (tm dont steal) he knew that his battle with Göring had only just begun."

Confusion was absolute. Was it the Celts? The Acephale? \nThe tanks pulled up to the Tuileries palace and drove right through the walls, settling in the central garden. The entire State Artistic Council ran out to confront them, guns at the ready. Artaud led the charge, fully prepared to die to destroy these traitors to France.\nSuddenly, the hatch of the lead tank opened, and out popped-- hold on-- was that fucking Fernand Leger?! He hadn't been seen since before the regime change! He was dead!\nLeger grinned at the councillors before him, still bleary from sleep. \"Gentlemen!\" he cried, sweeping his arm over the tanks, \"it is just as you see. Le Soleil is ours, and the instruments of the State have been cowed by our superior force. I will be taking the reins of the nation, to save it in this time of disaster. Now, you, Antonin, have a choice to make.\"\nHe stepped down from the tank and approached Artaud, holding out his hand to shake. \"Are you with me?\" he said, as his other hand raised a shining dagger, \"Or against me? Answer now!\""

I grabbed the clips, put them on and turned on the car battery. \"FASTER FASTER FASTER\" I yelled to daddy Artaud as the current cooked my nads. \"Better get going, need to stay on task.\" I quickly slipped on my leather jacket and boxer shorts and sprinted to the nearest Sonic, pushing one of the waitresses over and grabbing the food out of her hands. \"Shouldn't have been trad, idiot\" I whispered as I slipped the roller skates off her feet (oh those are ripe) and I got my roll on, skating back to my apartment at velocities that would make Marinetti (PBUH) proud. \"With a rollerskates, you can go anywhere you want\" I said, out loud.  \n\nAs soon as I got home I started up Draw.io. \"Bourbaki formalist neo-Pythagorean EsoMathSocAccel France path?\" I asked my friend in the mirror. \"What a great idea, you majestic stallion!\" I began to giggle, imagining the cringe soy reddit rage when we teased \"Set Theory for the State\" focuses.  With that trilemma settled, I took my mandatory 15 minute break to pray. \"Accelerationism is just Fast Fascism, praise be to our fathers Mussolini, D'Annunzio, and Marinetti IN THAT ORDER. They teach us that Fascism is when there's weird art and leather, and the more weird art and leather the fascister it is.\" I felt my tears of rapture mixing with the burger grease on my face into a delicious nectar, which I scraped off my face and offered to the altar. I would need their guidance in the hours ahead. \n\nAfter hanging the White Monster IV bag, I finished the focus tree. Fully implemented in just 25 minutes, still not even close to my record though *swag*. I didn't worry about descriptions or events, the Loc Fairy would take care of that. I started to gently convulse, wiping my chin. \"Uh oh, foaming again.\" It only took ten hours for the spasms to end this time, that was a relief. Before going to bed, I ran down to the gas station to grab dinner. I snagged a nozzle and selected 94 octane, guzzling the sweet Modernity Juice as fast as I could. Once my after-dinner blackout was over I got into bed. I needed to be up bright and early tomorrow so I could delay the update for the 20th time this month. I smiled as the motors began to roar behind my eyes."
