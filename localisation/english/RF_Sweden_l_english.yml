 SWE_Elmo_desc:0 "It would seem to be a banal truism that to be young in Europe in this age invariably also means throwing your hat in with this or that radical faction.  Elmo Lindholm, at thirty-eight years of age, younger than Artaud by a year, Levi by over a decade, and D’Annunzio by three, stands as proof that the virtues of tradition and conservatism are not exclusive to the old and feeble.\n\nAn academic by background, Lindholm began his initial flirtation with politics in 1920 when, attracted to the ideals of then Prime Minister Rudolf Kjelling, he joined the ultraconservative  Sveriges Nationella Förbund, acting as an editor for the organization’s monthly publication.  It was during this time that he began to pivot away from his academic interests in classicism and move towards politics as his primary intellectual activity; embracing a reactionary monarchist line defined by a celebratory attitude towards traditional forms of authority in Swedish Society.  Lindholm’s eloquent and powerful writings placed him in a favorable position for rising through the ranks in the SNF.  When General Bror Munck succeeded Kjellen as Prime Minister following the former’s death, it was the SNF which enabled the old General to gain the assent of parliament, and Lindholm, having himself written fervently in support of Munck’s hardline approach, was elevated to the leader of the party’s youth wing.  Lindholm’s prestige and influence only grew from there, culminating in his ascent to party chairman in 1934 and, with Munck’s death a year later, Prime Minister.\n\nOn a superficial level, Lindholm is the ideal leader for Sweden, as both an intellectual protege of Kjellen and a firebrand supporter of Munck, he seems positioned as someone capable of embodying the status quo of Swedish politics.  In reality, however, Lindholm is a far more astute writer than politician, and the exigencies of managing the complex network of estates, parties, factions within parties, and paramilitaries which form the foundation of Swedish Society could result in the young Lindholm suffering a premature death in politics."
 SWE_organic_state:0 "An Organic State"
 SWE_organic_state_desc:0 "Lindholm has managed to secure his hold on Swedish politics and with it a mandate to carry on the legacy of Rudolph Kjellen.  With the recalcitrants humiliated or removed from power, the path now lies open for Lindholm to guide the reins of state towards the fashioning of a truly living and breathing Sweden; body and soul to its people.  In honoring the memory of his mentor, Lindholm shall breathe life into this nascent organism, draw blood into its arteries and air into its lungs, so that Sweden may open her eyes, feel her own legs moving, and stride across Europe as its noble defender."
 SWE_hearts_crosses:0 "Cold Hearts And Crooked Crosses"
 SWE_hearts_crosses_desc:0 "Lindholm, in his delusional commitments to the unintelligible sophist ideals of “organic statehood,” that foolish bit of rhetoric wafting up from the rotting corpse of Kjellen, has become ineffectual and myopic to society’s true nature.  Power is something which flows naturally from those who are blessed with the racial and heroic nobility to wield it.  The Swedish nation is only as important as the purity of its people, the latter of which may only be preserved under the enlightened auspices of Sweden's own aristocratic caste.  It is the duty of the most noble to guard the flame of a people’s spirit lest it be extinguished beneath the stampede of mass mediocrity and racial degeneration.  It is to this responsibility that Count Von Rosen has selflessly committed himself on behalf of all Sweden’s people: high and low.\n\nThey’re so lucky to have him."
 SWE_aurora:0 "Aurora Borealis"
 SWE_aurora_desc:0 "Once, in the cold and distant chapters of history, Viking longships slid off the coast of Sweden and crashed into the icy brine of the North Sea, carrying within them the furious aplomb of Viking warriors who charted a path of ferocious glory across Europe’s boreal plane.  These overmen of yore, so far removed from the feminized rabble of modern Europe, held in their hearts the spiritual Northern homeland of Atlantis.  It is to their memory that we shall look to as we reclaim that frigid and pure city at the pinnacle of the North by bathing Sweden and the entire Nordic race in the vivifying Northern Lights of beauty and power."
 SWE_skies_fields:0 "Bluer Skies And Greener Fields"
 SWE_skies_fields_desc:0 "The regime which for so long kept the Swedish people shackled justified its existence largely on the basis that it was necessary for our safety, that without the firm grip of the SNF and military around the throat of public life we would descend into socialist chaos, a German-backed revolution would erupt in Stockholm, people would openly shoot at our beloved king…\n\nAs recent events have demonstrated, this was all a lie.  Immediately upon being faced with the sort of threat which for so long served as their entire reason for existence, the entire regime apparatus seized up in paralyzed terror.  Their recent failure belies the more uncomfortable fact that, in the past decades, our enemies have not been chastened in the least and have only continued to further encroach upon us.  Arvid Lindman, having awoken us from our decades long nightmare, understands that when one sacrifices freedom for security, they get neither.  With him at the helm, we begin our long journey towards a society that is at once safe from the predations of the Socialists and free enough to be the object of their jealousy."
 SWE_munck:0 "The Munck Era"
 SWE_munck_desc:0 "We did not have to wait long before the traitorous bastard Lindman displayed the shades of red lying beneath his polished veneer of Swedish colours.  Despite all his bluster about keeping Sweden “safe and free” his mere immediate move to disbar the Social Democrats from political activities proved definitively that all this was merely a sham for delivering Sweden into the hands of the Rotfront.\n\nFortunately for Sweden and her people, the vigilance of the army has stopped this internationalist treachery in its tracks.  In this hour of need Colonel Erik Grafstrom has appeared to rescue his nation, an act recalling his service with Bror Munck so many years ago.  Just like his hero and mentor, Grafstrom is willing to sacrifice everything to defend Sweden from the Red Tide, and will stand by his post for as long as it takes…\n\n…And it looks like it’s going to be a very long time."
 SWE_heart_north:0 "Heart Of The North"
 SWE_heart_north_desc:0 "The carnivalesque display of incompetence which followed the attempt on Gustav V life made it clear that the SNF government is entirely lacking in what it takes to defend their king and country from even a single person.  No one grasped this more immediately and acutely than the King himself, whose brush with death has spurred him to Lindholm as the head of government and install, in his place, Sven Hedin, in the hopes that his close friend and associate can return some dignity to skill to the governance of Sweden.  Hedin, in his cautious outlook has charted a path forward for Sweden which rests on ensuring placid stability above all else, leveraging his own celebrity and connections with the nobility to shape a serene and generous Sweden which cares for its people and cooperates with its allies while still giving no quarter to its enemies abroad."
 SWE_tower:0 "The Proud Tower"
 SWE_tower_desc:0 "Sweden stands as the lone major emissary of a lost world.  Germany collapsed into red madness, France was devoured by the wolves of accelerationism, Britain and Italy fell into an ineffectual Liberal slumber, and even Russia and Austria, steadfast in their commitment to tradition, found themselves gripped by revolutionary violence.  It was Sweden alone that maintained the torch of Old Europe, with all the power and splendor of that nearly forgotten age.  When the revolutionary tide of the new Europe smashed against the shores of Scandinavia in 1918, first in Denmark and then in Finland, Sweden took all available measures to insulate itself against the Red tide, conducting a scorched Earth campaign within its own politics, culminating in the thirteen year rule of Bror Munck, to burn away any trace of revolutionary fervor.\n\nThe maintenance of this reactionary status quo has entailed a vast curtailing of civic and democratic liberties, the perpetuation of a state of emergency within our politics, and the empowering of both the state as well as paramilitary organizations to execute an all but unlimited scope of counterrevolutionary violence against all threats within our borders.  This has ironically produced an atmosphere within Sweden far more akin to a permanent revolution than a serene rule of tradition.  Nonetheless, despite the occasional surfacing of Swedish society’s more chaotic aspects, the Kingdom remains that last best hope for Europe in the minds of the continent’s traditionalists."
 SWE_castle:0 "The Castle In The Forest"
 SWE_castle_desc:0 "Emerging from the smoldering embers of the Central Powers, the Birkeneid, drawing its name from a cataclysmic battle in German mythology in which the forces of the north will triumph over their southern opponents, stands as the noble shield guarding Europe against the twin abysses of Spartakism and Accelerationism, the great Vanguard of a more nobler time, the great avenging angel of the past come to dispense justice on those who dare defy her divinely vested power.\n\n…Ostensibly, at least.  In reality the Birkeneid is barely more than a strained mutual defense agreement between Sweden, its vassals, and the German rump state in Eastern Prussia.  Thus far there has been little evidence to suggest that the Birkeneid is capable of doing anything more than producing a continuous shrill inveighing against the forces of history sweeping across Europe.  Despite the fact that France and the Rotfront have continued their expansion unabated, so too has the strength of Sweden, and as the Birkeneid prepares with each passing day for this final battle in the forest, it appears less and less as a pathetic vestige of a bygone era and more as a force capable of sending Europe’s new age to an early grave."
 SWE_kjellen:0 "The Kjellen Era"
 SWE_kjellen_desc:0 "Rudolf Kjellen only served as Prime Minister for three years in the immediate aftermath of the Great War.  However the crucial historical significance of those three years, as well as the voluminous catalog of work produced throughout the remainder of his career in academia and politics, has established Kjellen as an inescapable presence within Swedish politics.  Kjellen’s conception of states as organic entities that compete for power remains the reigning dogma of the Sveriges Nationella Förbund, which has dominated national politics in Kjellen’s stead since his death in office in 1922; much of the policies, both domestic and international, pursued by the SNF are directly descended in some form or another from Kjellen’s thought, even as they were taken in a radically reactionary direction when General Munck succeeded Kjellen.  The notion of the state as a natural being transcending mere legal definition, the creation of robust social welfare institutions intended to reinforce an ideal of “national” rather than class based socialism, and, perhaps most importantly, the creation of the Birkeneid as a distinct means of consolidating geopolitical power, are all ideas which found their catalyst with Kjellen.  Despite this monopolizing influence, the stranglehold of Kjellen’s ideas on Swedish politics has begun to fracture, as an insurgent younger wing of the SNF shows an increasing disdain for the perceived cosmopolitanism of the Kjelling’s thought, while reformist voices grow louder in the accusations that the current government, in disregarding Kjellen’s more liberal tendencies, is doing nothing more than wearing his skin."
 SWE_wound:0 "An Unhealing Wound"
 SWE_wound_desc:0 "The Spartakist revolt in Norway was undoubtedly the catalyzing event for much of what has occurred within in our nation over the past decade, with the continuing survival of the revolutionary government in Bergen remaining a persistent source of humiliation and trauma not merely for Sweden, but also the innumerable Norwegians who remain loyal to their king.  At present, the Norwegian situation has taken on the position of an eternally unanswered question, something which those in the halls of power seem committed to banishing from existence by simply refusing to speak of it.  While this strategy has certainly enabled us to avoid a potentially disastrous confrontation with the Rotfront; our inability to excise this cancer on our own western border has produced, even among the most fervently loyal coteries of the Norwegian Kingdom, a skepticism in our ability to properly fulfill our task of protecting Norway and its people against the red scourge.  If action is not taken at some point, the Norwegians may decide to do so themselves."
 SWE_tundra:0 "The Bloody Tundra"
 SWE_tundra_desc:0 "When, in 1914, the Riksdag, under extensive royal pressure, voted narrowly to support Germany in the Great War after years of Russian provocation, it was not to the scarred fields of the Somme or the cragged peaks of the Carpathians that Sweden’s soldiers marched, but instead it was the frigid northern tundra which drew the most blood from Sweden during the conflict.  The “Lapland Campaign” would be Sweden’s largest contribution to the Central Powers’ war effort, and like many of the grand campaigns of the war, it would prove almost entirely inconclusive.  “Inconclusive”, however, is not a synonym for worthless, and Sweden’s lack of territorial gain during the Great War were at least compensated for by an invaluable growth of expertise within the Swedish military, and when the Swedish Jaegers returned home from the Tundra after the war, they were quick to align themselves with the emerging reactionary order in the nation’s politics, forming a vital backbone of the state’s both official and unofficial apparatus of counterrevolutionary terror.  This, coupled with the fact that Sweden’s comparative lack of casualties placed it in a uniquely advantageous position to assume great power status after the war, arguably made Sweden the only nation to unambiguously benefit from participation in the Great War."
 SWE_king:0 "Every Inch A King?"
 SWE_king_desc:0 "It is a popular joke in Sweden to respond to any exhortations for the king to step in and do something by saying that Gustav V is a king not a leader.  This jab at the monarch’s expense, tasteless as it is, nonetheless touches on the uncomfortable fact that our king simply is not himself these days, and hasn’t been since the death of his Wife so many years ago.  A simpering, gaunt imitation of regal power, he has become a muted presence in Swedish politics, incapable of raising his voice above the hum of the Riksdag, though it's doubtful he would even want to.\n\nNonetheless, the prestige of the monarchy is not something that can be wrung out of a man like water from a cloth, and Gustav V remains a figure around whom the figures of Swedish tread carefully, aware that with perhaps a few carefully words, this feeble twig of a man could completely alter the trajectory.  As such, amongst more acute political operators, the king is treated as something of a landmine rather than a joke, and those closest to him have no illusions about the power that inhabits this seemingly pathetic vessel."
