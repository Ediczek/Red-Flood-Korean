It was supposed to be the morale boost we needed, to buoy the economy and prevent a crash. But it was a pipe dream. Stocks have plummeted, food prices have risen even higher than before, and business are closing across the country. The Big Four are already planning for massive layoffs, and there are reports of some shareholders killing themselves. The exact reasons for the crash are obvious to those within the Emperor's personal council; the massive investments in military industry and imperial development have left the home islands underfunded, neglected even. No one could say anything, because the philosophy of Sonnō-ha was inherently militaristic, and any attempt to divert spending from the army or the navy was interpreted as anti-patriotic and cowardly. Now, it seems they were cowards not to speak out. Japan's future is now uncertain, to say the least. The situation in China is still precarious and now the Patriotic Vanguard of Okawa Shūmei will most certainly seize on the crisis, so we will need to heavily monitor political activity within the army and the working classes, or else we will fall to communist agitation. The Emperor's reign is now more threatened than ever, and now we must wait to see what becomes of our nation."

Sakai Toshihiko and Hasegawa Teruko are two of the more notable advocates, they have been distributing flies and dictionaries across the country at an alarming rate, there is now high demand for Esperanto tutors in Tokyo and Hiroshima. It seems as though the two may be at the fore-front of a linguistic revolution in Japan. The interior ministry has done little to prevent this movement, many among its own staff are also advocates. Some of the more traditional members of the Socialist Worker's Unions have kicked up a fuss however, claiming that these students and petit-bourgeoise clerks are trying to eliminate Japanese culture and identity.

That means a change in management; a new Emperor, in other words. Pretender to the throne Kamazawa Hiromichi has volunteered himself as the new Emperor, soldiers loyal to us have stormed the royal palace and are starting to build defences in case of counterattack. The defence was heavy, with some of the most fanatical loyalists of the Emperor standing guard. Our soldiers were able to blast through their fortifications with explosives, but with a lot of casualties on both sides. Police officers loyal to the Military Faction have also been working around the clock to preserve order and ensure that rioting and civil unrest is kept at a minimum; we can't allow the enemies of Japan any chances to destroy our nation, be it without or within. Now, all we have to do is hold out and wait for Hiromichi to come to Kyoto. Yasuhito has been surprisingly cooperative; he isn't happy with the situation, but he hasn't been doing anything to resist either.

The centre of the debate is focused on the idea of two women. Itō Noe and Yamakawa Kikue.\nItō takes the stance of keeping prostitution legal so that women across Japan may feel a sense of sexual liberation as well as opposition to traditional and exploitative roles imposed on women by the more conservative aspects of society which shame them (and in many cases kill them in cases of “honour killings”) for simply having sexual relations with other people.\nKikue however, views prostitution as a despicable institution which oppresses hundreds of millions of women across the globe. The idea of sexually liberated women to fall under the servitude of men is contradictory with the views of the revolution which supports rights for women.”"
 japan.32.a:0 "The debate begins."
 japan.321.t:0 "Itō Noe Takes The Stand"
 japan.321.d:0 "“Comrades, let us reaffirm what the nature of this revolution is. It is a movement that came from the peasantry in the countryside and the workers in the city. Those who stood up against the reactionary and neo-feudal remnants of our Bourgeois past so that we may be free from the chafing bonds of Capitalist and reactionary oppression! Thus, one of the staple parts of our movement, by its very nature, must be the rejection of reactionary views on the woman and on sex!\nSo, I ask you. What is there, more reactionary, more oppressive towards us than the standards and expectations of bourgeois society that have for so many centuries been placed upon us? I have heard many accounts of people in our beloved homeland and people in far away lands being killed in the streets simply for the pursuit of their own joy and desires or (perhaps even more atrociously) due to their need to try and relieve that crushing weight of poverty that came to them through the damnable evils  of Bourgeois oppression. Here we see a system that actively damages those who live under it when they do nothing against it and strikes out with greater ferocity when any attempt of escape is made! I have seen this system be rightfully condemned by all of you here. But one disturbing remnant of our bourgeoise past remains in an unsettling high amount of the people among us. And that remnant is the same thing behind the savage murders of countless innocent people! Traditionalism!\nMake no mistake, I do not believe in the eradication of our nation's culture. But we must recognise that reactionary views that actively suppress the rights and livelihoods of women have no place in our new nation! We must free women of the traditionalist roles imposed on them. If they wish to go to bed with someone out of love before they are married or for the sake of money or for the sake of the very thrill of the act, who are we to say that they shouldn't? Let alone shun them and kill them!\nIt is because of this, that I say that it is essential for us, if we are to stay true to our revolutionary spirit that we oppose any attempt at the abolition of prostitution! And in doing so, finally reject the traditionalist reactionary notions of the past to pave the way for our Socialist state!”"

It is most important that we oppose it in all its forms. And to me, it seems undeniable that one of these forms is prostitution.\nHistorically speaking, prostitution has never been kind towards women. As my opponent rightfully said, women have been killed for being prostitutes, though what she has ignored is that there are numerable times when the people they are serving are the ones who kill them! Whether this is to escape from the responsibility of paying for their services or out of sadistic perversions does not matter, because either way it shows us that the very act of prostitution will always subjugate the woman. Throughout history, in practically every civilisation, women have been placed in subservient roles to men and the abuse and humiliation that women endure as a result must be something that we must be staunchly opposed to no matter what! If we are to make a nation of revolutionaries and to dismantle the oppression of the pitiful remnants of Imperialist and Capitalist thought, then prostitution must be outlawed!\nBut it is not the women who we must punish. It is those who, at every moment, seek to exploit their suffering for profit. The panderers, the procurers. These petty bourgeoisie dogs must be sent to the wall just the same as everyone else we have taken up arms against! We must work to better the lives of former prostitutes to prevent any want or need to return to such a life. Once we do so, I am confident that there shall be no need or examples of exploitation within our new Socialist homeland! It is undeniable that if we wish to prevent hypocrisy and to prevent becoming the same as the pigs before us, then it is imperative that we take this great step onward to establishing a caring and utopian society. So let us, comrades, stand together to end this madness! Let us stand opposed to the exploitation of women, strike down poverty and therefore strike down the exploitation of women, strike down the petty bourgeois that poison our streets and finally form a society free of all traces of Capitalism and Imperialism!”"

There are many among the internationalist westernised academics at the head of the revolution that advocate atheism. In contrast, the popular sentiment towards these faiths from the general workers and farmers is that they represent the cultural core of Japanese society.

Meanwhile the extra tax revenue could be used to re-vitalise key services and sectors in order to boost employment and net income across tax brackets. The detractors have described such moves as the very sorts of socialist policies the civil war was fought to prevent. The choice remains..."

 japan.45.d:0 "After much toil and hardship, the economy is now recovering well. Government revenues must now be invested into new economic programs in order to make debt payments, the question is into which sector should the money be invested? The military companies are aching to stay afloat and are stoking revanchist factions to promote their cause, meanwhile many civilian sectors are still in the process of recovery and re-building."

 japan.500.d:0 "As crowded as ever, the meeting of the General Staff Council gives way too many ideas. While the voices of the older officers closer to the political cause of the Emperor ring the loudest, there are dissenting voices of younger officers who wish to bring in a fresh outlook to our operations, but the final decision remains, as always, with His Majesty."
 japan.500.a:0 "A decision will surely be reached in due time."
 japan.501.t:0 "전진"
 japan.501.d:0 "While a decision is yet to be reached as the second week approaches, there are things that need very little, if any deliberation. Major cities will be hard to occupy regardless of military resistance, and the Yellow River poses a challenge to be overcome. The army must march, even without a clear direction for the first few days."
 japan.501.a:0 "Surely they must have made their minds up!"
 japan.502.t:0 "An unorthodox decision"
 japan.502.d:0 "As the cold, hard ground of winter slowly gives way to a muddy spring, an unified opinion as well as the decision of His Imperial Majesty has been finally made clear. Japan, for the first time, would mount a major combined arms operation. While a clearly unexpected development that caught the attention of many international correspondents as well as the ire of the old guard, the obvious time constraints facing Japan have pushed His Imperial Majesty to pursue such an experimental approach. The decision of His Imperial Majesty stands clear, despite many shocked onlookers."
 japan.502.a:0 "Steel beasts to the fray!"
 japan.503.t:0 "Nothing New Under The Rising Sun"
 japan.503.d:0 "As expected, the restorationist old guard managed to convince His Imperial Majesty, who was already willing to do so, to follow their tried and true approach. Victorious in Manchuria, Korea and China, their expertise would guide Japan once more through a trying war.\""
 japan.503.a:0 "The whole meeting was mere formality."
 japan.504.t:0 "A Tremendous Victory"
 japan.504.d:0 "Through the plains of Northern China, to banks of the Yellow River, the soldiers of His Imperial Majesty have managed what many doubters and traitors saw as impossible, and have brought China under heel. Now, those who would dare use a potential failure as a springboard to their traitorous wishes remain silent, and all that rings is the righteous cries of 'Banzai!' as our righteous army parades through the streets, much to the dismay of usurpers and traitors."
 japan.504.a:0 "Tenno Heika, Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!"
 japan.505.t:0 "The Nature Of Occupation"
 japan.505.d:0 "While China remains occupied, it is important to consider the implications of such a large task. Japan is yet to fully recover from the burdens of our campaigns, yet the occupation proves to be an even bigger drain than the operation. Not only that, promises of a free Asia with the Yamato as its guide would fall flat if the occupation is to go on for longer. A decision must be made."
 japan.505.a:0 "Restore the legitimate government of China to their lands."
 japan.505.b:0 "Restore the legitimate government, but Beijing must remain under military occupation for full pacification,"
 japan.505.c:0 "Despite everything, we still require the land and resources for the greater cause."
 japan.520.t:0 "The Niceties of The Red Tape"
 japan.520.d:0 "As the size of the army remains still too large for the necessities of the operation, orders get confused, reach wrong places, munitions run low, and yet time keeps on moving. As things stand, the apparatus is too cluttered to move on."
 japan.520.a:0 "어쩔 수 없지..."
 japan.521.t:0 "Not Enough Guns, Not Enough Butter"
 japan.521.d:0 "While a rifle is not complete without the man shooting it, some extra ammunition and rations would clearly help said man. Unfortunately, the troops remain below capacity for a full operation, and without a good supply train, they risk even being encircled as they move deeper. Thus, operations naturally slow down, while time, sadly does not."

However, all is not well, as our constant militaristic adventures have left the domestic front awry. Protests in cities such as Tokyo and Kyoto have begun to cripple our ability to wage war, and the funds we need to fuel our conquest have begun to run dry. By our estimates, we only have three months to achieve victory. At that point, we will run out of both public goodwill to continue, and the very materials needed to fight. Three months, or else."
 JAP_streamline:0 "육군 간소화"
 JAP_streamline_desc:0 "While we may simply wish to roll over the Chinese like a wave across the beach, our military administration cannot handle simply throwing mounds of men at our enemies.

Therefore, let us fulfil these empty wishes, lest our lack of supply be our downfall."

Now, the Gunji Sangikan Kaigi -- the de facto inner cabinet of the Emperor since the Meiji Restoration, has become the de jure inner cabinet. Completely free of any bureaucratic or political meddling, it has become the true and only advisory body to aid the Emperor through trying times, be it the holy war in China, or the unrest at home."
 JAP_planning_advance:0 "Planning Our Advance"
 JAP_planning_advance_desc:0 "Despite differing opinions by all the generals attending the conference, one thing shines as bright as the sun above -- This war cannot be prosecuted recklessly, and one can not simply walk into Major cities like Taiyuan, Beijing, and Xi’an. Plans must be made, and the holy war must be prosecuted systematically, lest Japan leads her soldiers to their deaths."
 JAP_radical_suggestion:0 "급진적인 제안"
 JAP_radical_suggestion_desc:0 "From the meeting, one thing has become clear. Time is limited, funds to prosecute this holy war are drying up, and the enemy is becoming more and more entrenched in their position. Combining skill on the offence with the latest technological developments, a clique of unpopular, yet brilliant officers from the fledgling technocratic clique propose that every single dime Japan has is to be spent to deliver a decisive blow with fire and steel."

 JAP_continuing_as_planned_desc:0 "As enticing as using the latest technology and crushing the enemy with a storm of fire can seem, the realities of war are deeper than what the new school of officers are accustomed to. Japan fought through Northern China and Korea forty years ago -- and such tactics there have brought us victory. Thus, there shall be no changes made. The foundation of experience Japan has acquired over the years shall be built upon instead of risking defeat by using novel strategies."
 JAP_overcoming_hurdles:0 "Overcoming The Hurdles"
 JAP_overcoming_hurdles_desc:0 "A change as fundamental as the ones proposed do not happen overnight -- the army’s experience in armoured warfare is limited to the involvement in the Russian Civil War and the Northern Expedition.

 JAP_airforce_coordination:0 "공군과의 협력"
 JAP_airforce_coordination_desc:0 "Armor is not enough to overcome fortified positions. Without support from the air, any advance will eventually come to a halt as enemy reserves regroup and form new defensive lines. Therefore, extensive use of the air force to pinpoint artillery locations as well as to deliver fire from above to destroy the enemy’s willingness to fight and shatter their cohesion shall be the second piece to complete victory."
 JAP_army_streamlining:0 "육군 간소화"
 JAP_army_streamlining_desc:0 "In maneuver warfare, it is critical that orders reach their recipients in the shortest time possible.

 JAP_independent_tanks:0 "Independent Tank Brigades"
 JAP_independent_tanks_desc:0 "Getting rid of bureaucratic bloat is simply not enough -- The spearhead of the attack must be made independent from the infantry.

Only and only then will this campaign be finished in due time."

There is however room for improvement. Additional maintenance teams shall be allocated to get artillery in working order for a continuous advance, so that infantry does not exceed the range in which shelling is effective. Modifications to the train schedule will be made to avoid supply bottlenecks and instances where materiel shipments are unresponsive to the needs of the front."

 JAP_large_front_operation_desc:0 "The offensive carried out by the Japanese army will impress even European observers with its scale and severity. Scouring the landscape and attacking at every point reasonably will at best take the pressure off of our main forces aiming for strategic and political objectives, and at least it will see troops advance into territory adjacent to the main battles. This will be the leg sweep that displaces the enemy's center of gravity. This will be our determined push towards victory"

 JAP_executing_the_masterpiece_desc:0 "The time is now or never, our strength is reaching its climax and from here things will only develop in the enemy's favor. We have given the army the whole of the effort of our nation. If they cannot breach the strongholds, our generals deserve humiliation at the hands of a Chinese backwater rump state. If they can, however, then all the deaths so far will have not been in vain and glory will be well won. One last magnificent strike, for the Emperor!"
 JAP_knowing_our_enemy:0 "적수를 알라"
 JAP_knowing_our_enemy_desc:0 "The fields, mountains and rivers of northern China are vast, and nowhere near as interlocked as the cities of Japan.

 JAP_multiple_prongs_desc:0 "Control of the azure depths of the Sea of China as well as the golden waters of the Yellow River are essential if the soldiers of the Emperor are to succeed in their prosecution of this holy war. A landing by the SNLF is essential in order to thin out the entrenched forces of the enemy and secure critical river passages. So long as they stay under control, further advances into enemy territory shall proceed smoothly."

 JAP_deep_infiltration_desc:0 "Under cover of night, the army marches. What’s another hour of snoozing compared to the advantage gained by sending squadrons to perforate the enemy’s defenses and percolate to vital supply depots? Much of the enemy’s munitions have been captured and shall be used for this purpose. If spotted out of the corner of their eyes, infiltrators may have an extra second of doubt to exploit. A small advantage, admittedly, but any measure must be taken to ensure operational security. The main fighting force will recognize their brothers in arms after breaking through enemy lines by white armbands, dotted with the blood of the enemy."
