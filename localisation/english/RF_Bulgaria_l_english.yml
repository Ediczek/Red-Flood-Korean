 BUL_HISTORY_DESC:0 "Although the ambitious Bulgarian principality achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1908, its wars were only beginning. The \"Prussia of the Balkans\" would be at the tip of the spear when a relitigation of the Balkan War turned into the Great War, but the cost led to the 1918 Radomir Revolution that overthrew the Tsar in favor of a \"Social Republic.\" While stable since, not everybody is happy with the dominance of the agrarian BZNS. Furthermore, while the 1931 Treaty of Union with Yugoslavia was signed with good intentions, the division between the SJNK government in Belgrade and its autonomy of \"Thrace\" has only deepened in the past five years. With President Stamboliyski finally planning to retire, Bulgaria must walk a careful path into the future."
 POLITICS_Stamboliyski_DESC:0 "Aleksandar Stoimenov Stamboliyski is the face of the republic, a beloved benevolent ruler who cleverly balances his attention between the interests of the peasants, workers, army, intelligentsia, and bourgeoisie. At least, this is the shadow he tries to cast - that of a perfect father of the people. His origins are auspicious enough. The great agrarian leader was indeed born to a rural family. He also quickly became a political agitator against the Tsar's government, seeing its militarism as a threat to the Southern Slavs he identified with, or even to the whole Balkans. When Bulgaria turned on its allies in 1913 and inadvertently ignited the Great War, it seemed a mighty vindication. By 1915 he was arrested for speaking openly against Ferdinand's government, but in the final year of the war, he would be released from prison in an effort to use him to calm the peasants and soldiers on the cusp of revolt.\n\nInstead of being a loyal puppet to the hated Tsar, Stamboliyski took his chance, and with his friend Rayko Daskalov the agrarians, socialists, anarchists, and soldier councils united to topple the government. After the royal family was exiled, he was elected the first president of the Bulgarian Socialist Republic, and was broadly expected to be a compromise candidate between the socialists and military. His allegiance to the peasantry, however, saw him work to marginalize the urban proletariat, and together with his moves to subdue the army of the \"Prussia of the Balkans\" some would brand him the Orange Tsar.\n\nAlas... Bulgaria is an agrarian country, and the BZNS won every successive election through mobilizing that great voter bloc. On the international front, he would also be a party to the Belgrade-Sofia treaties of 1931 that officially began the integration of Bulgaria into Yugoslavia. However, age and term limits have done to this champion of Balkan unity what the opposition could not: this year will mark the end of Stamboliyski's presidency. To ensure continuity of his vision, he has given longtime friend Daskalov his official endorsement heading into the elections. With rumours of the opposition seeing their chance to break out from under his thumb, it remains to be seen whether Bulgaria will harvest the fruits of his labour."
 POLITICS_Botev_DESC:0 "Hail to Hristo Botev Petkov, warrior against Ottoman oppression, champion of Bulgarian freedom! As a young man, he was sent to Odessa for schooling, where he would soon become a teacher while also having his political awakening in contact with the Russian anarchist movement. Even before returning home, he would become a figure of the underground Bulgarian nationalist movement, even leading a doomed revolt in the 1870s. With the fall of the tsardom, he would finally return to the public eye at the head of the country's anarchist groupings, much to the confusion, yet also celebration, of those who assumed him dead. Skeptics claimed this was some sort of impersonator, but these words would find no place in hopeful Bulgarian hearts - the tales of Botev making a deal with fairies for eternal youth so that he could continue to fight against oppression went down in legend.\n\nThe Hajduk of the modern day went from an oddity to a hero anew when his forces led the charge to shatter the military coup. With the military and right defeated, the BZNS staggered, and the Leninists and social democrats humbled, it was easy for Botev to win the election as a bringer of peace. While a patriot, his coming to power has been heralded by the abolition of the oppressive state - but Bulgaria, even if it is his beloved homeland, is too small, too restrictive. A greater homeland, for him and all Slavs, is necessary.\n\nThe great leader Botev has begun his campaign of terror against those who hoard their gains and power. Bullets find cowardly hearts and mighty axes split open the skulls of the parasites. There is no need for a high-minded political program where a true anarchist simply has to know what is right and be strong enough to fight the enemies of the people. A hero long thought dead rides into battle, flanked by the spirit of Bulgarians and their Slavic comrades."
 POLITICS_Smirnenski_DESC:0 "Perhaps Hristo Dmitriov Smirnenski is living up to his father's legacy. Hailing from Macedonia, he came of age watching his father clash with Greek occupiers who opposed his open socialism. When the Great War began, his family would flee to Bulgaria ahead of the Greek army, and the young Hristo would make ends meet publishing satirical poems, even when he was drafted into the army. The violence of the Revolution made an impression on Smirnenski, who would drift into the communist camp in the aftermath. While prospects were slim for a communist electoral breakthrough, his tireless writing and advocacy would allow him to sideline the old guard Leninists of the party in favour of a more inclusive strain of the ideology that would broaden its appeal.\n\nSmirnenski's chairmanship at the end of the 1920s gave the communists a vision of societal unity that claimed to fulfill the original hopes of the Bulgarian Revolution. Unfortunately, little of that seemed to matter before Stamboliyski's electoral juggernaut - at least, until the attempted military coup. When the army and its allies in Zlatarog were sowing chaos in Sofia and the countryside, it was primarily the communists who were in a position to stabilize the city streets and then march on the rebels outside. The BZNS had lost its lustre as guarantor of stability, and the new face of heroism was able to make inroads with the social democrats and farmers to triumph in the elections.\n\nThe reactionaries within the BZNS and army are scattered. The \"anarchists\" and bandits have been driven away. The domination of the Bulgarian peasants is finally in question. Smirnenski is ready to answer. Bulgaria needs frantic industrialization to make proles out of peasants. The Orthodox Church must have its political power broken, but the state must pursue the Christian value of charity in its stead. But perhaps radical reform of Bulgaria is not enough, not for a young heart such as his. This country needs a new, red army, one to ignite a truly Balkan revolution from Budapest to Athens! The impoverished and oppressed of this beautiful land cry for aid and freedom, and Hristo Smirnenski's Bulgaria will answer."
 POLITICS_Daskalov_DESC:0 "The dust has settled, and Rayko Ivanov Daskalov sees the necessity of what his friend Stamboliyski did not - swift and decisive action against the enemies of the state. Nothing else will do for the Orange Vođa, not only of Bulgaria but of the whole of Yugoslavia. Born in the city of Veliko Tarnovo, he was another one of Bulgaria's sons sent to die in the Balkan Wars, where he lost his brother. As the bloodletting turned into the Great War, Daskalov found himself cursing the naive adventurism of Tstar Ferdinand. He wasn't alone - meeting and befriending Alexander Stamboliyski set him down the path to leading a revolution.\n\nWith his combat experience and political connections, Daskalov became the chief of the paramilitary Orange Guard, which went from an army auxiliary to the shield of the Republic. Perhaps ferreting out military conspirators and socialist militants for over a decade was why the Guard was so prepared for the crisis of the attempted coup. Stamboliyski's exit in the wake of the shooting gave Daskalov the political cover he needed to begin settling accounts. This was not just with the mutineers, who were punished for their disloyalty, but the ostensible allies of the BZNS, those socialist and anarchist paramilitaries who were preparing their knives while the Orange Guard defended the state.\n\nWith Bulgaria's opposition in shambles, the pieces are in place for agrarian supremacy to be enshrined for all time. The BZNS must forge unity between its wings, and President Daskalov is ready to ratchet up Yugoslavist rhetoric to appeal to them - this time with the union led from Sofia, not Belgrade. In this way, the legacy of his dear friend Stamboliyski will be secured, but the new President looks forward to his own destiny as well. His mission is to free the peasants of the Balkans, uniting them into one state that will protect their ageless interests. All hail the Orange Vođa!"
 POLITICS_Deunov_DESC:0 "Peter Deunov, Peter Dunoff, or if you call him what he wishes, Beinsa Douno, is not merely a man. He is an angel speaking through earthly flesh. Deunov's quest of love started in his pious village of Hadardja, from which he traveled to America to finish study of theology in the Methodist seminary of Madison. Rather than becoming a pastor upon his return, however, he was seized with a desire to travel around the country sharing the Christian revelations he had received. The fall of the Tsardom gave the itinerant preacher a chance to meet President Stamboliyski, sparking a close friendship and, many assumed, the grooming of a successor.\n\nAlas, disinterest in temporal politics put an end to those rumours. Seeing BZNS as a reasonably pious party, removed from the decadent excess of the Orthodox churches, Deunov was content to continue his preaching on the assumption Stamboliyski would bring the people closer to spiritual purity. The death of the President and chaos in the streets changed everything. Peter's eyes filled with tears as he witnessed brother killing brother for cheap politics. When even the Fatherland Front turned on itself, and it seemed a terrible, bloody anarchy would be loosed on the people, he chose to act. With his students and apostles, Deunov walked the countryside again to preach peace and universal brotherhood, picking up many more supporters who were tired of the war. In his final destination, Sofia, the exhausted army and militias battling over the capital simply surrendered before the size of his flock, and he was allowed to proclaim himself the ruler of Bulgaria.\n\nAt last there is peace, but on top of that peace comes a new spiritual and political order. Stamboliyski had not gone far enough; only a truly godly government could end the suffering of Bulgaria - no, of humanity. Deunov, though an advocate of peace, has learned well from his friend's mistakes, and the error of Gandhi. The voice of an angel emanates from the mouth of the prophet, and it calls for the destruction of the enemies of God, be they the landlords, the Fatherland Front, the bourgeoisie, the socialists, or even the Church authority."
 POLITICS_Shaytanov_DESC:0 "The devil of Bulgaria, or a prophet of Dionysius? For a historian and philosopher who particularly focused on Bulgarian folklore, Nayden Hristov Shaytanov may be an unlikely candidate for such vitriol, and yet, and yet.... Perhaps he would have been merely an essayist and journal publisher, if not for the revolution of 1918. One of the young stalwarts of the monarchy, Shaytanov was immediately, if quietly, hostile to the socialist government, seeing it as imposed by foreign Gods to enslave Balkan souls. As he developed his concept of the Bulgarian essence further in academia, he would soon amass a circle of conspirators around him known as Zlatarog, named after the goldhorn of myth. Seeing the value in a faction of anti-socialist intelligentsia to support their coup, the military conspirators against Stambolyiski would reach out to invite them into the Fatherland Front.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Shaytanov and Zlatarog were not content to share power with mere military strongmen and opponents of the peasantry. Seeing their chance, the internal conspiracy struck before Stambolyiski's body was cold. The attempt at decapitating the rival factions of the Fatherhood Front was not as clean as expected, but what is in this world? Blood flowed like rivers in the bitter fighting that followed.\n\nBut this purification required blood. The barbarians of Zlatarog crushed the Christians and naive co-conspirators in Sofia and began their rule in the name of Fourth Bulgarian Tsardom. Now the truth of the people can rise to the surface, the primeval influences of the gypsy, the Thracian, the Bogomil and the folk bandit. So ends the oppression and domination forced on the Balkans by the West, whether through slavish dedication to an alien faith or economic exploitation. Balkania, realm of the Titans, will forge its own destiny once more, and strike fear into the hearts of those who brutalized it for two thousand years."

In the wake of the Yugoslavist Treaty of Union in 1931, plots against Stamboliyski's government have not only begun to arise internally, Belgrade itself does not look kindly upon the recalcitrant region of Thrace. As Stamboliyski nears the end of his last term, the coming events will define Bulgaria's future."

The army conspirators, keenly aware of what was transpiring in the People's Assembly, had assembled their loyalists in an attempt to force the hand of the Assembly away from dislodging or damaging the army's influence on Bulgarian politics. Nervous faces of onlookers peeked furtively from around street corners and windows, watching and waiting. Inside the People's Assembly, members rushed to barricade the doors in a whirlwind of outraged pandemonium. They too, rushed to windows and other vantage points at the front of the Assembly building, gazing out into the square.\n\nHavoc was ongoing in the streets, everything from shopping carts to stalls being hauled and placed in makeshift obstacles, with angry citizens and militiamen blocking the path of the oncoming military columns. By the end of the pandemonium, both sides stood opposite from one another in front of the People's Assembly, separated but baying at one another from behind their impromptu barricades. The stand-off dragged on for well over an hour.  Quietly, the ringleaders bemoaned their loss of momentum. The tension was finally cut by a young officer stepping out from amongst his fellows carrying a list in his gloved hands...\n\n\"We, the brave and stalwart men of the Army of Bulgaria, absolutely and resolutely reject all attempts to undermine the role of our grand institution in the defense of the Bulgarian nation. Our purpose here today is to gain, with no possible room for backhanded politicking, a guarantee of the inviolability of our integrity. The army shall NOT be carved up and crafted into the tool of the Assembly...\"\n\nAs the young officer went on, Stamboliyski and his ministers frantically devised their next course of action.

Barricades stood in every street of every city, but the situation was the worst in Sofia. Orange Guards and the leftist militias stood against the soldiers, guns raised and waiting for the signal to start another shootout. Between them - bodies, bombs, shrapnel, destroyed vehicles, and terrified civilians.\n\nDe-escalation did not seem like a simple thing. The slightest movement, a single pull of the trigger, and the quietest sound of a distant gunshot could have unleashed a veritable inferno. The situation was being watched keenly by communists, socialists, anarchists, and agrarians, who knew that if their militias were crushed, the army could easily march into Parliament and slaughter them all.\n\nHowever, the world belongs to the brave. Hristo Botev, who according to some people was a mere disguise (it would be impossible for an 88-year-old man to look so young!), vividly called for a fierce confrontation in order to crush the soldiers and their allies with a decisive blow. He began his speech.\n\n\"My comrades! We Hajduks do not know the concept of peace! War is the only hygiene of the world! I expect only three things from every man, woman, and Bulgarian child! A knife between the teeth, a bomb in the hands, and an irrepressible hatred of reaction!

Comrades, I give you one simple instruction: let's strangle these bastards here and now! Let's cut off their hands and impale their heads on stakes!\"\n\nThe Black Guard who had gathered in \"Popa\" Square enthusiastically started cheering, clapping... and even shooting into the air. This caused concern to the other partisans in Sofia when they heard distant thunder. However, the anarchists did not care about fear, their hearts were full of fire. However, the soldiers were bringing up heavier guns to the confrontation. Yet more escalation. Botev and his men began to move towards the barricades and Rayko Daskalov - the right hand of Stamboliyski, who was observing the whole situation from a distance - felt his hands were tied.

We don't even know if Smirnenski knows about this! Damn it, Daskalov, calm down for God's sake!\"\n\nRayko looked at Stamboliyski, but only paused momentarily before shrugging off the hand on his shoulder. \"How can I be calm when facing this farce?! The Communists are supporting reactionary militants who want to overthrow our Republic! There have been incredible absurdities since this revolt! Soon the pigs will grow wings and fly over Sofia!\"\n\nStamboliyski adopted a grimace on his face and rolled his eyes. He turned his head away from Daskalov for a moment wondering what to say to him then returned. \"So what do you want to do? Shoot them when we don't even have solid evidence?\"\n\nRayko looked again at the Orange Guardsman and the papers he had brought him. He corrected his glasses. He thought for a moment, then, without looking at Aleksandar, replied gravely. \"Maybe... Maybe it's the only right solution.\"\n\n\"It takes finesse, you imbecile! And the anarchists and social democrats will kill us if we try something like that...\"\n\nStamboliyski was twisting his moustache angrily when the guardsman grunted loudly, interrupting the argument between the two friends, and pulled out some more papers. They concerned Nayden Shaytanov's group of poet-modernists. He began to move his finger from conclusion to conclusion, speaking bluntly.\n\n\"Zlatarog, bourgeois-intellectual circle. Thracian neo-pagans, Pan-Balkanists, Bulgarian nationalists, and former monarchists. Indeed the communists may have some connections with the cliques in the army... but for me, this is just a diversion for us, Comrade Rayko. These acolytes of Shaytanov have more reason to hate us than the communists.\"\n\nDaskalov was frankly awed - that was a bizarre collection of beliefs under one conspiracy. Stamboliyski, at the same time, grabbed the papers to verify the contents. Raising an eyebrow, then nodding, he spoke up with a more-concealed shock: \"I would personally... I'd slay these freaks before the communists. What do you think of that, Rayko?\"\n\nDaskalov took out a cigarette and lit it. He looked uncertainly at Stamboliyski and at the Guardsman.

Some of them struggled to meet Stambolyiski's gaze, and a weasley-looking man broke the silence.\n\n\"Mr. Stamboliyski, the telephone lines have been cut and your security has been compromised.\" A smirk immediately broke through his facade. \"... which is why we are here. National justice will be served today.\"\n\nStambolyiski gazed into their eyes and sighed.  \"If it has come to this, let it be served, but know that you are making a grave mistake. You will unleash a bloodbath that will stain our beautiful nation for years to co-\"  A smack to the face stopped the Vozd's sentence halfway through, and his visage grew red as a dark laughter came from the group. Soon, a rain of vicious kicks and gobs of spittle fell upon their leader, yet Stambolyiski somehow remained stoic, even as his face was beaten into a caricature.\n\nThrough blood and broken teeth, their President spoke once more: \"A time will come when you look to me for guidance, and you will find nothing. You are the ones who will butcher Bulgaria, and my death is all that stands in the way. And even then, we men live and die, but our ideas live forever. I have lived enough, and the peasant idea will prevail, even if I fall to defend it.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said the apparent leader of the men. \"Untie him. Let all of this be forgotten.\" Stamboliyski hesitantly got out of his chair and left the villa, only to find it empty and unguarded, which was when a drunken assailant lept atop him and drove a knife into his side. There was no dignity in what came next, as the President tried to drag himself across the ground, being spurred on by kicks and stabs. One of the soldiers bellowed something about what happens to elderly, useless horses as he produced a butcher's blade out of his sack. In his dazed and beaten state, it was only when he saw one of his ears thrown down in front of him that he knew what had occurred.\n\n\"Butchers, what have I done to deserve this!?\" the beaten man howled.\n\n\"Remember Makedonia, you hog! You butchered Bulgaria, and we have come to butcher you in turn.\" A soldier punctuated this by jamming the blade into Aleksandar's thigh, carving off some indistinct meat. Someone from the crowd suggested that the Vozd looked hungry, and a dark tide of laughter rippled through them. One ran towards the scene and elbowed Stambolyiski's jaws open, before another shoved the fallen meat into them and forced his mouth closed and open.\n\nMercifully, his consciousness left him soon after. It was a while longer before his life followed.\n\nThe following morning, the Vozd's corpse was found by his brother - at least, he assumed it was the Vozd. Its arms were held fast to the tree with knives, meat and muscle stripped bare in places, and clearly someone had made off with the head. Yesterday's date was written on its right side in blood.The news didn't take long to spread, and the capital exploded into the biggest storm it had ever seen.

No candidate could defeat him, and no assassin could fell him, and yet, and yet...\n\nThe Father of the Bulgarian Revolution, Aleksandar Stamboliyski, quietly rose from his chair at the head of the assembly hall, walking with dignity and poise to the speaker's podium. A hush fell over the People's Assembly as Stamboliyski took his place, surveying the eclectic array of representatives that made up the fledgling government he'd fought tooth and nail to create and maintain all these years. His own Agrarian Union, the Balgarski Zemedelski Naroden Sayuz, formed the majority of those before him, orange ties and other symbols of allegiance on full display. Seated at either side of them were their tentative \"partners\" in government, the Anarchists, with their black armbands, the communists of the BKP sporting red, Social Democrats, some token representation from the military, and other minor representatives. Further in the wings, delegates from Belgrade's SJNK watched on, dispassionate as usual.\n\nShuffling his speech papers a little and raising his voice, Stamboliyski began a solemn yet rousing speech about the past eighteen years at the helm. He spoke of the chaos of 1918, the destitution and ruin that old Tsar Ferdinand and the Royalists had wrought. Then he spoke about the first flames of the revolution, when the common peasant stood arm in arm with the weary soldiery and threw off the shackles of oppression, from the foundation of the Orange Guard to securing the new Socialist Republic in the face of counter-revolutionaries. He spared no opportunity to reiterate and affirm his belief in the peasantry of Bulgaria, praising what he called their inherent dignity, putting the continuance of his government solely in their service. Furthermore, he repeated his support for the current balancing act of market and socialist interests for the sake of the Agrarian cause. Finally, Aleksandar gestured directly to the delegates from Belgrade, reaffirming his firm belief in Pan-Slavism and his commitment to the 1933 Treaty of Friendship, which bound the Yugoslav State and the Bulgarian Socialist Republic together in the \"two systems, one people'' compromise.\n\nHis party roared their appreciation throughout with cheers and applause, but the cracks were visible to any keen observer. The BKP's members were terse in their applause, and many looked on coldly, for it was an open secret that they reviled supposed compromise of the revolutionary cause. Likewise, the anarchists' reactions were a mixed bag, and their supposed leader, Botev, was not even present for the speech. Some might have noted that among the observing army officers, some looked almost enraged by the whole affair.\n\nConcluding his speech, Stamboliyski officially confirmed what many already knew. Rayko Daskalov was endorsed as his replacement to head the BZNS for the elections soon to be held in due time. Stepping down from the podium to thunderous applause, he walked out of the People's Assembly to mark his formal resignation."

There is an atmosphere of incipient chaos within the Bulgarian civil service, as the precarious balance and the spider webs of tentative agreements and compromises at the local and municipal level in previous years has been upended. Galvanized, there is now an ongoing effort to at long last provide a formally consistent core policy by which the economy of the young republic shall be run.\n\nMultiple differing proposals have been put forward to better serve the people - or at least that's what their proponents say. Botev and the Anarchists advocate an uncompromising push towards complete decentralization, and the full adoption of bottom-up planning nationwide. In stark contrast, Smirnenski and the communists of the BKP propose wiping the slate clean by putting an end to the mixed economy and dictating economic policy via central planning from Sofia, ending market actions entirely. Wedged in the middle of these two radical proposals is that of the ruling Agrarian BZNS. They remain loyal to Stamboliyski's \"Orange Model,\" to stay the course and maintain the current system of market socialism, for the supposed benefit of Bulgaria's peasant majority.A decision must be made, however, and after days of fierce debate, political maneuvering, and hurried action, it has been announced that..."

Over the past 18 years, the Agrarian cause has advanced further than any of us had dared to dream of. As we once languished in the ashes of the Great War, we stand at the cusp of greatness: a united Balkan state devoted to and run by her people, the peasantry! We must remain firm, and I can promise you this now, I shall go even further to ensure this. Many Bulgarians fear that the modernization of agriculture is to the detriment of the common man, but to this, I say no! Perhaps, in the hands of corrupt bankers and cold businessmen, this might occur, but our state is the people's! Mechanization, modernization, these need not be the enemies of the agrarian cause!\"\n\n\"Yet I must emphasize caution too. Some have been deluded and misled into believing that Bulgaria should industrialize in the same way that the rest of the world has. To turn our cities into smog-filled giants of industry and soot, the likes of London and New York. For the sake of what? For what they call the \"progression of history?\" To disdain the peasant's role? To force him en masse to the cities for want of work? Is this worthy of us Slavs? NO! Is it worthy of a people gifted with a land so fresh and fertile? No, no, and no!  I refuse to believe our chance at prosperity is truly shackled to the destruction of the agrarian man's livelihood. Industry shall serve our needs, not vice versa...\"\n\nPausing, Rayko surveyed the now bustling crowd arrayed in front of him. Workers, peasants, activists, militia, itinerant merchants, elders, youths, men, and women.

A riot had begun, one of many across Bulgaria over the past few days.\n\nAgitation led by the BKP and other more orthodox socialist groups is at an all-time high, with impassioned young members and other radicals taking matters into their own hands and roving the streets in angry mobs. Their prime grievance is with the \"Orange revisionists\" of the BZNS, whom they have long quietly thought of and now loudly declare as the enemies of the socialist dream, compromisers, and pseudo-bourgeoisie. While the upper echelons of the Communist party have not declared themselves explicitly in favor of these agitators, it is clear to many they operate with the quiet approval of many within the BKP.\n\nOutside a well-to-do manor house on the edge of Velingrad, one such red mob had descended. The panicked owner and his friends had barricaded themselves inside, furniture and cupboards piled against the windows and doorways. \"Where are the Guard?! Where are the damned Guard?!\" he cried as another flurry of rocks and other debris clattered and smashed off the window he was blocking, desperately pressing against a motley assembly of antique cabinets and chairs.\n\n\"Get out here you burzhoazen rat!\" shouted someone from the mob, a burly fellow wearing a red armband. \"You're gonna get what you deserve, do you hear me? Languishing in that rotten house of yours for the past bloody decade and a half like you're still above us.\" he spat, lobbing another brick as he spoke. It sailed through the air before crashing through the doorway window, a muffled flurry of panicked shouting erupting from inside the besieged manor house. The mob whooped and shouted their approval, a cry of \"OUT! OUT! OUT!\" rising in a frenzy.\n\nTheir cries were cut short by a flurry of warning shots fired into the air from the rifles of the local Orange Guard, who had fought their way past the rioters guarding the gate to the manor grounds. \"By order of the People's Assembly, this gathering is illegal. Disperse immediately!\" came the bellowing shout from the Commissar leading the motley band of militia. The crowd turned to face them, shouting insults and protests, and more than a few colorful words aimed at the persons of Daskalov and Stamboliyski. Stopping just short of one another, both sides of the confrontation brandished makeshift weapons along with the odd ax or knife, though only the guardsmen carried firearms. The mob made the first move, a hurled stone crunching into the nose of a young guard member with a sickening thud. Discharging his rifle as he fell to the ground, the stray round struck a rioter in the shin, who fell screaming and clutching at the wound. As if the cries of pain were a starting signal, both sides surged forward."

 bulgaria.14.desc:0 "Tensions were high in the hall of the People's Assembly, thoroughly packed, and with nearly full attendance. Amid a constant buzz of grumbling and murmurs, a middle-aged functionary of the Social Democrat BRSDP took to the speaker's podium, a determined but almost nervous look on his face. Dabbing his forehead with a handkerchief, he waited for the humdrum of the assembly to momentarily abate. \"Comrades, we are at a crossroads and have been stuck at it for far too long. Our republic denies our people the future it deserves...\" he began. To this, a ripple of grumbles began from the other parties, some approving, some disapproving. He continued, \"I will be frank with you, we have been done a disservice by Stamboliyski. What kind of revolution can we truly purport to be serving if we allow and accommodate petty capitalists and bourgeois elements? We have been promised social change for years now and yet we remain here in this limbo, this farce of so-called market socialism! For the sake of the peasants they say, yet more live in this country, do they not? What of the proletariat, the urban worker?!\" shouting at the top of his lungs at this point, as the assembly hall detonated into a storm of shouting. Opposition groups like the communists and anarchists shouted their approval alongside the social democrats for once, whilst the Agrarian Union majority and their allies yelled protests.\n\nWith a crimson face, the Social Democrat continued despite the cacophony. As voices quietened once more, a question cut through the air. \"What do you propose then? How shall we address the issue of the \"Bulgarian bourgeoisie\"?\" asked a rather young anarchist, one of Hristo's followers. Taken a little aback, he stammered a reply. \"It is the policy of the BRSDP that we should purchase and distribute all eligible property to the working class as nee-\"\n\n\"THE SAME AS THE AGRARIANS?! HYPOCRITES!\" cried a BKP representative, as the hall exploded into arguments and insults once more. The anarchists and communists decried such a policy as half measures and appeasement of class enemies, a foolish denial of class conflicts and interests. On the other hand, the BZNS members hollered that the peasantry was the backbone of the nation and must therefore be served first and foremost, for the benefit of all, even if it meant deviating from socialist norms. Collectivization and change would come, they said, when the time was right and in an appropriate manner. This only outraged the opposition more, with some needing to be held back by their more level-headed peers. Other, smaller groups soon found their own opinions drowned out.\n\nUltimately, three main opinions vied for supremacy in the chaos of the People's Assembly. Botev's anarchists demanded nothing less than the immediate abolition of private interests that remained, to be distributed amongst local communes as needed. The communists of Smirnenski's BKP instead demanded that no compensation should be given, and assets were to be seized and used as needed for the sake of the \"revolutionary vanguard\" centered in Sofia. Daskalov and a rather dismayed Stamboliyski maintained the BZNS party line of any change being solely in the interest of the Agrarian cause, any existing so-called \"concessions\" being in place clearly for the peasants' benefit.

 bulgaria.15.t:0 "The Last Important Question"
 bulgaria.15.desc:0 "If the tone of previous recent sessions of the People's Assembly could be described as tense or even hostile, then the tone of this hastily called newest meeting was positively calm. Serene even. Perhaps it was due to the nature of the question at hand. It was a burning question, one that had plagued Bulgaria since the anti-tsarist coup had arisen, one considered by parties on both sides of the aisle. It was that of her erstwhile army and what the future of the military would be in this new Bulgaria. The gravity of the situation was punctuated by the glaring absence of the usual army officers who attended the meetings of the People's Assembly.\n\nRegardless of the army's lack of attendance, one thing was universally agreed upon. A radical change in one form or another was sorely needed. The problem was how it should be achieved. As with most major issues brought before the Assembly, wildly different solutions were presented by its various factions. Remarkably, the \"least\" extreme option was presented personally by Hristo Smirnenski on behalf of the BKP. They pushed towards maintaining and further centralizing the structure of the armed forces, which at first was met with some rumbles and accusations of \"half-measure\" and \"lukewarm\". Smirnenski's true solution was soon made known, however, the officer corp was to be thoroughly purged and restaffed with young and loyal officers as needed. \"The old guard is a counter-revolutionary tumor that needs to be seared off, but it is clear that a modern centralized army is the ideal means of protecting the Revolution,\" Smirnenski stated firmly.\n\nCountering this, Rayko Daskalov and the BZNS proposed a comparatively more active solution. The existing army and the paramilitaries such as the Orange Guard would be integrated into one body, with paramilitary officers being strategically inserted at all levels of command to peacefully ensure the political loyalty of the armed forces. After all, what better way to ensure the Army's loyalty than by officially combining it with the party militias? Such a measure, Rayko claimed, would create a \"Popular Army\" that would \"not be estranged from the working man's cause,\" as he put it. In sharp contrast to both of these reform proposals, the Anarchist representatives put forward Botev's proposal of a \"truly revolutionary army\", one of complete dissolution and reconstruction. The army in its current form would be disbanded, and as a leftover of an \"oppressive past,\" it must be done away with its current form. The traditional military structure would be left behind, the defense of the people being the responsibility of local militias and a new \"Insurgent Army\", a democratic militia given the task of regional defense beyond the local scale. It would be a force run \"by soldier committees and general assemblies, not generals and their commissioned lackeys\" as one young representative boasted loudly, fire in her eyes. Indeed the traditional notion of an \"officer\" was to be done away with, commanders would be fully elected, and fully accountable to their men, with the army being based on self-discipline, all disciplinary measures to be decided upon by the committee.\n\nThe debate raged on for hours, everyone keenly aware of the gravity of this choice, but eventually the plan that won the day was..."

With wide-eyed children and curious farmhands watching curiously from the roadside, they wound their way toward the local metal shop. The sight was not an uncommon one these days, Daskalov's executive decree was clear: Plows to Swords. Eventually arrayed in a line outside the metalworker's shop, a small crowd of welders, grinders, and laborers got to work. First came the steel sheets. Curved, ground and then welded, they were arrayed across the front and sides of the tractor engines. Next came the plating over the glass, enough so the driver could see, but not enough to make him an easy target. Protection in exchange for visibility. Lastly came the carriage and gun. The three-point linkage was exploited fully. Rather than waste excess material on the full body of the tractor, a carriage, and emplacement holding a machine gun or light cannon was put in place and affixed to the tractor's rear end.\n\nThe so-called \"Boyan Conversion\", the brainchild of the engineer Viktor Boyan, allowed for the rapid conversion of standard agricultural tractors into \"tank\" equivalents, requiring much less material and time for both conversion and reconversion. While not exactly a match for modern mainline tanks, to say the least, such a convenient and cheap means of producing combat-ready machines allows for rapid consolidation of power. Practicality aside, what more powerful image of the triumph of the Agrarian cause could there be? That with which the peasant plows his fields, he defends from the outward forces that would deny him his own. Plows to Swords. Swords to Plows.\n\nAfter a couple of days, marked by sparks, shouts, and sweat, the work was done. The former tractors hummed their way out of Gradnitsa, rebuilt. Each carried a new crew member and carriage. Thick steel and a machine gun or light cannon. Off they wound back into the countryside, to reinforce the Orange Guard. To reinforce the cause."

Imposing and ornamental, it spoke of a time not long departed, despite the shattered glass and bullet holes that riddled their way across the brickwork, peppered along all sides of the manor. Mere weeks ago, the Orange Guard had brawled with BKP agitators who had attempted to evict the owner and forcibly take over the residence. The country house had been one of many locations targeted by BKP-aligned radicals and youths, infuriated at what they saw to be an unacceptable \"compromise of the socialist and proletarian cause,\" with the recent crisis caused by the attempted military coup proving enough to finally galvanize the hardline communists of the BKP into action. Tensions soared to an all-time high. Across the country, their supporters had taken to the streets and begun to attempt a process of forced collectivization.\n\nIn defense of the agrarian cause, and the delicate balance of market socialism that Stamboliyski had strived to maintain, Orange Guardsmen had successfully defended the manor and other areas across the country. In the end, the crowds and gangs had been dispersed and ringleaders were discovered and detained. The crowd advanced up through the gardens and into the house itself, much to the indignation of the landowner at this supposed turn of fortune. His protests turned to outraged cries when the peasants began piling and arranging the contents of the manor on the porch and courtyard.\n\nWhat is the meaning of this? Please, be careful with that-\" he blustered, before rushing to confront the commissar. \"What madness is this Petar, I thought the Union had an arrangement for people like me. Your boys drove off the Reds, now you act like them?\" he said breathlessly.\n\nAt this comment, a couple of guardsmen made a start for him, but the commissar waved them down. \"Control yourselves comrades, he's just surprised,\" he said calmly. Turning to face him, he said \"Quite the opposite, Comrade Anton. If my armband was red, you would have been taken away or executed by now. The people of the Union aren't savages - you'll be compensated fairly. Cows, sheep, a plot of land, and room and board with your compatriots. Congratulations are in order: you're a proper Agrarian now. Collectivization was always going to happen sooner or later, Comrade.\"\n\n\"B-but this is my home,\" Anton blustered.\n\n\"Long may it still be, but you will be sharing it and its grounds with your compatriots,\" Petar replied a little curtly, handing him his official notice of compensation from the BZNS. \"It's time to face the facts, Comrade, this process cannot be stopped.

Juvenile couriers also sufficed to discreetly carry messages to other operatives.\n\nYoung Halid was a loyal communist. His family would have disapproved, and was largely unaware of what he was doing - the gaze of the SJNK was enough for them without inviting more scrutiny on their house. They were a pious family who prayed morning and evening. However, Halid was weary of praying toward Mecca. He was looking for something more. The charming ideals of Marxism had hit the fertile ground.\n\nHe was not happy when his colleagues drank beer with Bulgarian money. He still remembered what his father had told him about the stuff, and he'd done a few creative stunts in the past months to pretend he drank along with them.

Other times he handed over a letter. Once they even sent him on a pistol exercise! It was too heavy for him; he could hardly carry it in his tiny hand. Halid, however, learned by example the eternal teachings of Marx, Luxemburg, and Lenin. He was still keeping up appearances at school, but all the knowledge it provided him seemed foggy and devoid of passion.\n\nWithout hesitation, Halid accepted his new task: bringing a surprisingly heavy bag to the commissariat of the armed wing of the local ORJUNA \"Action Group.\" The building was surrounded by a fence and barbed wire, a new addition as the revolutionary situation in Bosnia matured. Halid, however, was small enough to squeeze through the wire. He was not concerned about little scrapes and tears in his clothes - the cause was everything.\n\nPicking the most inconspicuous door he could find, thankfully already ajar, the young militant entered without incident. He walked through it slowly and placed his bag beside the nearest table...\n\n...Suddenly! Halid's world went completely out of focus as something glass struck the back of his head. He fell to the ground crying, glared at by some militiaman who had clearly been trying to air out the room during a smoke break. The man's initial reaction of hostility swung to shock at having attacked a child, then grim resignation - the communists were determined to make bastards of us all, is that it? He knew none of these kids were evil, but an infiltrator bringing a bag of guns sounded like the start of another surprise attack.\n\nAt least, he thought they were guns, until the commissariat exploded, and then he didn't think at all.

Of course, his men showed their fangs through their great bushy beards and sharpened their bayonets, in case the fool tried something.\n\nThey were not completely wrong. Indignant, the professor shouted out: \"You are a phony and a liar! The real Botev has been dead for 60 years! He was killed by the Turks and you stole his identity. I don't know how anyone could be fooled by your stories! But if you are the real Botev then share the secret of your immortality! Did the fairies give it to you or did you make a pact with the devil himself?\"\n\nWell, the professor seemed proud of having confronted the Black Vođz. Perhaps the chattering of students and peers about his exploits had been especially annoying. But Botev turned his head calmly towards the setting sun and pointed toward it.\n\n\"Do you see that beautiful sunset, my friend?\"\n\nThe professor furrowed his eyebrows uncertainly, but turned toward the sun. Well, the sun was there, same as ever. He nodded confirming once, twice, and then spoke up again:\n\n\"I see! But what does that have to do with- ACK!\"\n\nPow! Pow! And pow! In a flash, Botev drew his revolver, and decorated a nearby tree with the professor's brain!\n\nVarbanov finished his story to peals of drunken laughter, even the odd malcontent falling off their seat. Varban, seeing this, smiled proudly and crossed his arms. One of his companions placed his hand on his shoulder and raised his cup.\n\n\"Another round for our friend Varbanov!\"\n\nOf course, nobody there knew that Varbanov was a pseudonym for Hristo Botev - who, thirsting for even more adventure, assumed the name so that he could tell his life stories to the people he met. Some facsimile of them, anyway."

 bulgaria.23.desc:0 "\"Beautiful weather today, isn't it,\" muttered Botev to nobody in particular as he struck a match and lit his cigarette, deaf to the muffled shouts of protest in the orchard behind him. Leaning back in his saddle, he took a deep drag and let it settle for a while in his chest before tilting his head back and exhaling almost blissfully. This tour of the troops was a welcome reprieve from the central committee, even if only for a few days at most. His horse whinnied a little at the smell of tobacco, flaring its nostrils. It took all his willpower not to sigh in disappointment as he heard the sound of approaching footsteps, breaking his brief reverie.\n\n\"Voivode Botev! They're ready for you now,\" blurted out a gleeful young man of the local militia, proudly sporting a black armband. It cheered him up a little to see a youth like this - maybe the cause had a future yet. Perking up, he tugged the reins a little and gave a toothy smile, taking his cig out of his mouth. \"Well then hajduk, let's not keep the boys waiting,\" he replied cheerfully as he began to trot over to the commotion by the orchard's gate.\n\nThey were a sorry lot, whimpering there, tied hand and foot to the product they would have once denied their fellow man. Merchants, bourgeois hoarders, reactionary thinkers, the lot of them. Gagged, the orchard's former owner in particular had screamed loud enough to shake the heavens as they had tied him to a tree, for all the good it did him. The man was protesting still, biting at the cloth. His nose looked like something resembling a crushed plum - he'd bitten the lad who had gagged him and had suffered for it. The crowd surrounding this sordid display were veterans of the anarchist struggle in Bulgaria, hard men dressed in a mix of civilian and paramilitary attire. Their only common \"uniform\" a black band worn somewhere on their person.\n\nBotev bellowed out to them, gesturing to a group of wide-eyed young villagers, barely men, swept up in promises of adventure and glory. \"My fellow strugglers! Today we welcome new blood into our ranks!\" They stood apart from the insurgents with their clean clothes, beardless faces, and soft air to all of them. \"To truly test their mettle,\" he continued, something low and malicious creeping into his voice, \"let them prove their hatred for their class enemy.\" As he spoke, the young men were slowly cajoled to the front of the gathering, opposite the restrained prisoners.\n\nTheir bewilderment turned to shock as insurgents handed them rifles. Some showed a flicker of hesitation, guessing what was to come. \"Now, you can't expect to be a good soldier without being a good shot, can you hajduks?\", barked a grizzled old insurgent with a twitch in his cheek. \"Aim!\" came the command, shouted by an equally rugged veteran. The recruits obeyed, as the muffled screams of protest from the trees grew louder in panicked response. It was then that \"Hristo Botev\" noticed that his cigarette had gone out, and as he struck another match..."

Triumphant shouts likewise erupted from the anarchist militia gathered outside, the bombers congratulated by their peers for their aim.  The echo of the blast had yet to fully fade before figures could be seen crawling through the rubble. Stunned bank clerks tried to escape, the ones who didn't have the good sense to flee when they had the chance earlier.

The fighters scattered to cover, returning their hail of gunfire as she crumpled into the gutter.\n\nIn the wake of the SJNK's dissolution, the former policemen and enforcers of the state had degenerated into cliques and gangs of varying loyalties. Those, such as the ones holed up in the former bank, were one of many who had decided to defend \"their neighborhoods\" from the roaming anarchist bands. Smoke and dust choked the air both inside and out, bullets splintering the fine wooden furnishings and chipping the marble columns amidst shouted orders. The shooting attracted more blackcaps to the chaos and soon, the former police ran out of ammunition. The ensuing melee was short and brutal, a waltz of clubs, knives, and bayonets.\n\nAs dusk fell, more smoke erupted from the bank. Cracked vaults gave up their treasures and flames roared into the evening sky as the triumphant blackcaps hurled bundle after bundle of bills into towering bonfires. Drinking, clapping, cheering, and jeering, the celebrations went on far into the night."

Nayden Shaytanov, in robes to conceal his identity, was making his way through Vitoshka Street while hoping that there wouldn't be a massive queue in front of the seeress' house already. Vangelia Gushterova was gaining a bit of a popular following in Bulgaria, and she was granted a house near the city's main street by the Zlatarog as a gift to her and her family. When he entered through the gate and into the yard, he saw that there were indeed only three people waiting in the queue facing the front door.\n\n\"The Signs are very good,\" Shaytanov thought. \"Will we, as a people, follow in the footsteps of the great Balkan Emperor Alexander?\" \n\nA soft, but stern, female voice with a noticeable dialect interrupted his stream of thoughts.\n\n\"Doctor Nayden Shaytanov... and his friend, come on in!\"\n\nAs Shaytanov was nearing the front door, he saw that the porch in front was overflowing with bread, sweets, salt, wine, and banknotes - even small carved sculptures left in tribute. When he entered, a young woman took his coat and led him to a big, dark room, then told him to feel free to sit on one of the chairs. She lit the oil lamp on the desk, and the soft, warm light graced her face, revealing her features - an attractive young girl of good, Balkan-Thracian stock, her features delicate, yet strong, monolithic and respectable, her eyes covered by a blindfold. She dared to break through the silence first.\n\n\"You've come to me emulating a great man's deeds, yet of the past we shall not speak, for you have to hear of the future. Steel your ears and your attention and let your mind wander not to the olden days. The citizens of the world have come a long way, and now they stand at the cusp of a great precipice, and they stare into the darkness beyond. You are a man that holds power - you brought with you a being of great might. Both of you should know that the actions that you undertake in this time of wolves will determine whether mankind will brave the depths of the precipice or run away like a defeated mongrel.\n\nThe butterfly came to us by the Eastern wind, and gave us a ring and water from the living days of the ocean.

When Nayden had offered the throne back to Tsar Ferdinand, he was rebuffed in disgust. The reaction of the Bulgarian people to the theoretical return of the dynasty was also so sharply negative that for a moment he worried the regime's survival was in doubt. Somewhere in his studies of local folklore and custom, however, there was a solution.\n\nAt his invitation, all the gypsies from all over Bulgaria came to Sofia. Their caravans filled the asphalt and cobbled streets - and for once, everyone welcomed them, as if they were the purest people untainted by Abrahamic lies. When the elders met with Shaytanov, he begged them for one thing - their blessing to be declared their king!\n\nThe tests of spirit were many, but in his wisdom and purity of heart, he passed them all. Nayden Shaytanov, bookish leader of the Zlatarog circle, would be crowned. They anointed him with holy oils and clothed him in the garments of their people, and for once, his soul was as free as their feet were free from the humiliations of the hypocritical world.\n\nWhen Shaytanov emerged from the temple in Sofia, he rode through the city gates on horseback proudly. As if to welcome him and his enlightenment, the Sun emerged from the clouds to greet him, anointing him with its rays. The Bulgarians - Thracians - cheered for their leader, and the Gypsies saluted their new Tsar. Turning proudly on horseback, he beamed and issued his first decree as President and King: \"Dance and rejoice! This is what I, the messenger of Zagreus and Dionysus, command you to do!\"\n\nThe city exploded into festivities - dancing, feasts, sensual pleasures. Nayden Shaytanov himself admired it all as they set up his tent. He sat on an opulent couch like Emperor Heliogabalus and admired the decadent scene, surrounded by beautiful young men and even more beautiful women, while the finest wine was poured into his chalice.\n\nThe trials and tests dispensed with, the city's new arrivals spent the evening in comedic displays for their new king. And what a treat for the King! Shaytanov burst into laughter repeatedly throughout the night, watching his new subjects at play, and mused to himself: \"This is a full life blessed by the Gods! This is what life should be!\"\n\nThis was a sign that he was doing good. To himself and Dionysus, he swore that he would fulfil his task. He will lead his proud armies against the rotten West!

 bulgaria.27.desc:0 "The villagers of Tsarevo gathered for a grand celebration of a traditional Bulgarian festival! This age-old ritual, which has persisted since pagan times, was intended as a protection against rabies. Some have decried it as cruel, yet since the coming of Shaytanov, no one has been particularly vocal in their criticism.\n\nThe ritual involves erecting a structure by a body of water, then hanging a rope loop off of it like a swing. A dog is placed upon the rope, hanging over the water. One of the bystanders then tightens the rope loop by spinning it in one direction, then lets go, leading to the swing and dog spinning wildly in the other direction as it unwinds. If done correctly, the confused animal plunges into the water, but upon swimming to shore, it will continue spinning in a daze. Performing this ritual was supposed to guarantee that the dog and the owner would be free of rabies.\n\nIn the new era of the state, a decision was made to publicize a performance of the dog spinning ritual near Tsarevo. Some representatives from Kavkaz and Poland were even invited to what was intended as a display of Bulgaria's deep connection to its Slavic roots. The wooden structure was decorated with carved symbols of Thracian deities and mythological beings. And of course, donning a solar crown and traditional garb, Nayden Shaytanov himself would preside. A beautiful hound had already been fixed in position above a river by the villagers, and their King was the first to spin him. Just as intended, the whining dog plunged into the water, but Shaytanov was by his side in a flash to lift him out. Moments later, he was posing for photos with the mutt to prove all was well!\n\nThe opinion of journalists and observers was mixed. Few knew how to react to this bizarre ritual, but it was only polite to cheer along with your hosts. A procession of villagers continued in the ceremony, approaching the structure and putting their own dogs in the snare of the ropes. Each splash was punctuated by the festively-dressed people issuing cheers for each other's continued good health.\n\nAsked about it later by his colleagues, one of the Kavkazian visitors had to think for a while about the solidarity he witnessed."

However, to his surprise, apart from the fanatical babble of these lunatics, the results had been better than expected. The sectarians were ironically far more radical than the Agrarians. Bozhidar was, after all, a communist, so he was pleased that Peter, despite believing he was possessed by an angel, knew that nothing could beat the power of a planned economy!\n\nWaiting for the bus gave him time to reflect. He was quite happy that the whole ordeal after Stamboliyski's death had passed and he would be able to get back to writing his articles again. Though he had his suspicions about the limits of their tolerance, the Brotherhood did seem to be sincere pacifists. Maybe he would be able to work comfortably despite his denunciations?\n\nThe bus rolled up to the stop, and Bozhidar walked up to the door to see a plump driver in uniform, proudly displaying his cross around his neck. He felt the desire to make a cheap jab about it, but thought better of it. \"Good day! We are having really wonderful weather. Could I ask you to drop me off by the University of Economics?\"\n\nYou see, public transport was free after Deunov's economic reforms, and being civil was probably the smart choice when you had no fare to make a man tolerate your remarks. The driver answered cheerfully: \"No problem! I'll just ask for your identity card.\"\n\nBozhidar raised his eyebrow. This was new. Still, he took out his wallet and handed over the card. The driver pulled out a thick black book from under his seat and leafed through it, holding the ID with his free hand. Varna residents, surnames, and-\n\nThe driver frowned. \"Please forgive me! But unfortunately, you are blacklisted. Your social credit is too low. Now I have to ask you out of the bus.\"\n\n\"What social credit?\"\n\nHanding the identification back sheepishly, the bus driver issued a half-recited explanation. \"Our dear leader Peter Deunov, wishing to promote the Christian way of living and positive values, has introduced a social evaluation system. Apparently, your score is too low. Please, my friend, familiarize yourself with the system at your nearest civil office! God bless you!\"\n\nThe door slid shut, and the bus drove away. After the explanation registered with him, the atheist ran after it, shouting curses against this backwardness... but no insult towards God and his servant Deunov could stop the speeding bus. Soon, breathless, he watched it disappear into the horizon, and started to familiarize himself with the long walk ahead."

They were to perform a great sun dance - the Paneurhythmy - intended to help its participants achieve inner balance and harmonization. And of course, for their physical and spiritual betterment, for it is an exercise that allows a conscious exchange with the forces of nature. Deunov's sermons describe this ritual not only as a dance but as a science! The perfect combination of human thoughts, feelings, and actions!\n\nGathered at the top of the world, the pilgrims began to perform 28 spiritual exercises. The first ten, also known as the \"First Day of Spring,\" were to be performed without interruption, symbolizing a spiritual awakening just as spring awakens after winter. Many Bulgarians, new initiates into the White Brotherhood, ran into immediate difficulty, but Deunov was understanding. He instructed each of them kindly, supportively. He knew that the exercises must not be performed mechanically, but with heart! Each exercise, through music, movement, and its name, revealed its secret ideas.\n\nAfter completing the 28 exercises, the Twelve Gates of Life were opened to those gathered! The twelve exercises of the \"Sunbeams\" consciously called upon the twelve symbols of the zodiac. The participants, matched in pairs, formed two groups. Acting as rays of the Sun, the pairs approached the center from twelve different directions, symbolizing the reception of vital forces, and then stepped back to bring these forces into the outer circle. In the next movement, each partner in the pair spun around the other. The meaning? An evocation of stages of human development, in which humanity is trapped in the circle of material consciousness, only to be liberated from it and experience pure joy, expressed by the chanting and clapping of the participants.\n\nAt the end, the 'Pentagram' was performed. The pentagram is a symbol of the human path to perfection, each ray symbolizing love, truth, justice, and virtue, united in the shape of cosmic man in motion - arms, legs, and head. In groups of five, each pair was compelled to constantly change their place with the others, proving that man must be in motion for the virtues to flow into to him.\n\nAfter the exercise, 75,000 people marched ahead, representing proudly through their lives the virtues they had acquired during these spiritualistic exercises."

Thousands and thousands of people, barefoot so as to be closer to God and nature, came to the ceremony, praying and singing... The clergy who were invited were considerably less enthused, of course. Something unusual was happening to their flocks.\n\nThe aim of the congress was to reconcile all groups present. Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac and Patriarch Gavrilo V immediately exchanged hostile glances when they arrived at the meeting. The idea of reconciliation among themselves was already absurd, and yet another sectarian leader figured he'd make an attempt. Typical.\n\nThe congress hadn't gotten far past the introductions when Cardinal Stepinac gave an exasperated summary of his position. \"All in all, Croats and Serbs are two worlds, the north and south poles, that will never become close except by a miracle of God. The schism is the greatest curse of Europe, almost greater than the Protestant deformation. In it there is no morality, no principle, no truth, no justice, no honesty.\"\n\nGavrilo V rose indignantly from his chair to reply, yet froze in place when he saw the host's reaction. Deunov smiled warmly, despite everything, and scratched at his beard before rising to his feet. The rabbis looked uncertainly to the imams and the Ulama, then back to him.\n\nThe leader of the White Brotherhood proclaimed with a voice that carried beyond his calm tone. \"I believe in ONE ETERNAL TRUE GOD Who has spoken to me in the past, Who speaks to me in the present, and Who will speak to me in the future. I believe in the Lord and His Spirit, who created the conditions for my salvation. There is no Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Jew, or Muslim to me. There are only the brothers in faith and those who do not yet believe.\"\n\nStepinac, sitting back down, cleared his throat and repeated a question he had asked at the beginning. \"So why have you brought us here?\"\n\nArms spreading towards the sky, eyes looking past the assembly to some future beyond.\n\n\"Mine eyes have seen the glory. The glory of our God! I want to say that I will work for dialogue... or even ecumenism of all our religions and of all humanity. I believe in the power of peace. I see one world united in one brotherhood, the White Brotherhood. I have gathered you to discuss matters of theology in a calm manner.\"\n\nGavrilo V, finally finding his composure, spoke up, not able to hide his concern. \"Who are you to say such things?\"\n\nDeunov turned his gaze away from the sun and embraced Gavrilo's whole person, and how he answered stuck a primal fear into the Patriarch."
