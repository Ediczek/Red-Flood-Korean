 ASY_DESC_MENU:0 "Born under Allied auspices after the idea of a united Euphrates valley was rejected, the Assyrian State is Europe's gift to the many Christian denominations that rose in arms against the Ottoman Empire during the Great War. Although notably underdeveloped save for spare British and Russian backed relief and investment, it enjoys a harmonious tribal society overseen by the Patriarch of the Church of the East, His Holiness Shimun XIX. This theocratic stagnancy has recently come under attack by modernising efforts from within, and now Communists, religious reformers, and Generalissimo Petros await for a chance to bring Assyrians into the 20th century before a foreign power does it themselves."

Tortured by coughing fits followed by the splatter of blood, everyone knew he was he dying. He knew he was dying. And yet, he could barely say a word, his throat too ached to even vomit some memorable last words. He couldn't even voice his word when the priest came to administer the last rites just some hours before. He could only desperately clutch the wooden crucifix and nod vigorously. The scorching sun that had invaded the room burnt his skin and made his trembling body sweat. Christ had endured thrice the terrible agony he was suffering, but Shimun Benyamin couldn't even scream at the Heavens to take this cup away from his lips. He contented with suffocation and a salivating mouth that couldn't swallow the red-stained spit veiled behind his lips.\n\nDirectly in front of his feet, a severe Christ. Severe? Kind? It was impossible to tell with his dizzy eyes. He knew he could feel his immobile stare but couldn't make out the Messiah's expression. Was God judging him? Is that why it was taking so long for him to die? Had the Divine Judge not come to a decision yet? His mind raced back to the last thirty years, the Great War against the Sultanate and shrapnel splitting the sands in half, the corpses floating down the Tigris, a British ambassador shaking his hands. Had he not been a good shepherd? The flock, even the black sheep, were safe and taken care of. Maybe he could've done more. But being a Patriarch and a politician was so difficult. Dealing with tribal disputes, foreign industrialists, bandits at the borders, the poor in the cities, God! Thrice-named God! Incarnate God, Fatherly God, Ghostly God! He did the best he could! Why couldn't the He give relief and embrace him?\n\nWith the wringing of tensed muscles of Christ pierced by Longinus, the Patriarch crawled in his bed towards the wall in which Christ stayed silent. Choking in tears he made his way across the mattress and blankets, shooting pain in his ribs. He prostrated his almost-corpse facing Christ, but his thin arms couldn't support his own weight and fell face-first into a cushion. Rolling his body to face the ceiling, he could finally feel his soul escaping from his mouth. Blood flew from the sides of his lips down to his white luscious beard, pooling the whole bed in red. Last breaths, slow. A moan, a whimper. A single word.\n\n\"Alaha!\"\n\nSome minutes later, his wife opened the door of the room where she had left her husband to make peace with God. Ignoring the ghastly scene, she closed the blinds of the single window in the room before kneeling before the bed and caressing her beloved's hand one last time. This last reunion between lovers was drowned out by the cymbals and trumpets outside that signalled the death of the Patriarch. These would be the most trying times of the young Assyria, now orphaned."

Over the past week cohorts of workers had come from all across the Nineveh plains to aid the reconstruction and cleanup after the battle that earned them their liberty: bricklayers had repaired the buildings that suffered from careless artillery, military vehicles wheeled across the pavement guaranteeing peace, and the last injured from the makeshift hospital in the aerodrome had been discharged or transferred. This ambience of urban vigour had contributed to a steady rise in morale. Many had feared it'd just be the peace before the storm, but instead of harassment by rain of fire and brimstone Assyrians had found themselves zapped with electrifying thunder: the upcoming elections.\n\nThe prospect of self-determination, although brainy and romantic, had managed to rapture the passion of many young men. They now flocked to the capital in droves, seeking to join a political organisation and aid the newly born republic. Even when the brave made speeches in makeshift platforms in favour of this and that and the stupid tried to kick-start their own parties, soon it became absolutely apparent that Assyrian politics were Manichean.\n\nOnly two options remained for most: the Assyrian Democratic Party and the Assyrian Socialist Party. The former's name, to the amusement of the more cynical, was rather euphemistic: the Democrats mindlessly followed their headman Agha Petros and were mostly members of the army. Although they proved willing collaborators with the Assyrian Socialist Party and so far had shown nothing but goodwill towards liberalisation, their priorities laid elsewhere. Great dreams of an Assyrian Empire had taken over generalissimo Petros's imagination, promising to transcend petty tribal identity with an appeal to Sennacherib's conquests - only with a radically modernised industry and riding tanks instead of chariots.\n\nThe other option, the aforementioned Socialists, had another way of seeing things. Assyrians, yes, need to modernise - but chasing ziggurats in the sky was for fools. What the people needed was a true nation, not an appendage of the Church. Peace, land, and bread: this was the promise of Freydun Atturaya. A true-born patriot and socialist since the Great War, Atturaya defended with stern words the Assyrian national homeland as defined by his Urmia Manifesto, not the petty rump state the Tzarists and British had delivered. With contacts among the red movement in Russia, the Socialists promised an Assyria in the world stage in brotherhood with other liberated peoples.\n\nElections came faster than anyone anticipated. Cars and mules from cities arrived last minute with thousands of forgotten votes, positions were sold and bought, campaign continued at the footstep of ballot boxes, and the general chaos made for quick and sloppy elections. And yet, it was Assyria's first conscious decision for itself, emancipated from oppressive Patriarchs and foreign domination. Recount after recount, the final national assembly was set up, and an undisputed victor was chosen from the two main currents."

I'll spare you the details, reports should find you alongside this letter. You were right, the flatland locals call Ninweh is ripping at the seams with crude oil. I owe you a Jackson. However, there's trouble.\n\nPossibility of local headquarters opening in Ninweh city or Beth Nohadra is unlikely. Despite our more optimistic projections, General Petros' distrust for the British Empire has not endeared him to us either. His government is as chauvinistic as it's ambitious, so negotiations will be ugly if they ever happen. Unlike Ibn Saud or the Syrians, the Assyrians seem dead set on complete autarky. Nationalized oil industry is the only thing they want to settle for, at least at the moment. \n\nNot all hope is lost. Talks with some middle-ranking government officials are fruitful. If we gather enough support from the administrators and the army (who hold real power! what a \"republic\"!) my team believes we can sweeten the deal to Mr. Petros. The only thing that man loves more than his own country is war. \n\nSome gifts here and there, some promises, some connections to \"suppliers\" in the States... I believe we can cut ourselves at least a 30% portion of the cake after some initial investment. Hear me out: 30% is not little. It's 1/3rd of an oil deposit that most likely rivals SOCAL's early concession in Arabia. It's the deal of a lifetime. We get our oil, they get their money to pay for guns and whatnot.

To our knowledge, the League of Fiume has sent no ambassadors to Ninive in spite of repeated attempts at contact with their regional headquarters in Cairo. M. Montecuccoli blames the natural Latin abulia of Italians. Irregardless and following previous instructions, we began to gather and compile information on the Assyrian state on our own. Below is a partial update:\n\nMeetings with Petros are fruitful. Advance of a full evaluation suggests him to be obsessive and autocratic. His knowledge of French is sufficient to hold long conversations without translator. M. Ravaillac has earned his sympathy through expensive imported handguns, winning us eyes over several projected plans. His territorial ambitions put even M. Augier to shame. Military development and expenditure continues to be his number one problem. I have asked le Quai for authorisation to offer the lending of military technicians and instructors to spare him the shame of entering Damascus with an army mounted on donkeys. \n\nM. Damiens noted the presence of a small team of Americans whom we learned were representatives from the TEXACO oil company that previously dealt with the Saadeh and Saudi governments. A certain Hubert XXXXXX visited ministries and offices along the city, and we suspect they plan to bribe and lie their way into a deal with the government over rumoured oil deposits in the northern plains. If our intentions are to permanently counter their influence, M. Damiens has found a rooftop in the city with direct line of vision to their hotel room, and a long-distance rifle already been acquired.\n\nWe have collaborated with Americans against the Anglos before in Syria, and if this happens to be a similar case we suggest and encourage sitting down with these representatives for an informal agreement among gentlemen. Taking into account CalTex's previous friendliness with German items in Arabia, we have also already begun employing mail carriers to send us their personal correspondence and wiretapped their telephone landline.

As most of the members of the new government are former members of our Party who speak Russian with ease, I have easily acquired an audience with comrade president Atturaya, to discuss in detail the relationship between our nations and the development of socialism in Assyria.\n\nOur talk was long and fruitful. President Atturaya has proven to be a man of intellect, knowledgeable in Marxist theory, to the point of making pedantic corrections of our \"unorthodoxy\", and well-acquainted with the situation in the Russian social-democratic movement, his sympathies laying with the Menshevik faction. However, his main ambitions remain national, and he has repeatedly stated that reclaiming Assyrian territory occupied by the Kurds will remain one of the main priorities of the socialist government. I have to also inform, with regret, that he has shown little interest in the most revolutionary of our projects and lacks an understanding of new perspectives that Futurism would open to the Assyrian revolution.\n\nWhile comrade Atturaya is not willing to compromise his Menshevist program of socialist construction, nor to break his party’s association with the Spartakist International, he is open to cooperation with the Caucasian federal authority in the task of expanding the proletarian revolution in Eurasia. Particularly, he has informed me of large petroleum deposits discovered in the north of his country, which he believes to be a key resource necessary in the proletarianisation of his feudal homeland.\n\nComrade Atturaya has proposed the establishment of a cooperative petroleum syndicate that would unite the industry in our nations, as he wishes to acquire the technical expertise of our personnel employed in the Baku fields. I urge the commissariat to consider this proposal and present it before the economic planning bureau. \n\nThe Caucasian involvement in the development of Assyrian petroleum industry is paramount to securing our position as the monopolist of fuel production in the revolutionary world. I have received reports of German agents in the area, who may wish to break out of dependence on the oil from Baku. Therefore, I again urge the central commissariat to consider comrade Atturaya’s proposal with the highest priority.\n\nPS: I have given comrade Atturaya several Futurist propaganda materials translated to Aramaic to distribute around Nineveh. I hope that will teach the philistines some culture."

 asy.15.title:0 "Propaganda in Times of Cholera"
 asy.15.desc:0 "\"Sire, please, I do not understand at all! Can't we leave this dreadful book and return to the beautiful stories you told of Mar Maiakuvski?\"\n\n\"No, no, no! We cannot! Please, we have to get past at least the first chapter of Das Kapital today! And I'm a comrade, not a sire!\"\n\nSargon sat on top his makeshift desk defeated, barely finding the strength to keep holding the heavy book for a minute longer. With a sigh he let go of the tome and hung his head low. It has his third day living among these people, one of the many villages that dotted the southern lowlands near the Euphrates. He had been sent here by the party on the back of a camel, carrying a truckload worth of leaflets, books, photographs, posters, flags, and who-knows what else since he hadn't even had time to unpack everything yet. The people were kind and willing to learn at first (after they saw the crates of food some aides had brought along, no doubt), which deceived him into thinking it would be an easy task to proselytise about communism in the middle of nowhere. Most hadn't even heard the Patriarch had died until he rode along, and he somehow doubted they noticed the Ottomans had fallen or that there ever was a war that toppled their oppressors. He didn't even discount that at some point someone might ask him which Seleucid emperor was reigning. The other day an older man asked Sargon about his odd name, and he tried his best to hide his bafflement at how people who lived at the footsteps of ancient ruins had never heard of those who built them.\n\nLost in thought, he turned away to the portraits of Marx and Atturaya that now embellished the little plaza in which every tribesman was gathered for their daily lessons. He didn't even want to word what he thought of the situation, perhaps some colourful metaphor about neanderthals. The change from leaving to study in industrial Baku to living in developing Ninweh to this was almost too much. A tug in his trousers broke the pessimistic spell.\n\n\"Comrade Sargon, we really want to hear more of that city of wonders in the Caucasus. Please, we'll read two chapters next day, we promise!\"\n\nA young girl had stepped up from the crowd and gently grabbed the leg of his uniform. He couldn't help but smile. The previous outburst was nothing but stupid, these villagers weren't cavemen. They might use the formulas of old tyrants, read of Marx and Bebel as saints, even call Mayakovsky a \"mar\" as if he was a Patriarch; but they nonetheless understood. Intuitively, naturally, they understood the message. They knew of progress and industry, they knew of liberation and socialism; they just had no words for it. His task and hope was giving them the words to comprehend and interpret the world around them. It was that simple. \n\n\"Very well! I have already told you of the great iron city of Baku and the scientists of Tiflis, but here's something I haven't told you yet.\" The bored and frustrated villages began listening more attentively, and Sargon could see some sparks in curious eyes. \"To the far west there lies a country known as Germany, so vast not even from the top of Babel you'd see its end. The Germans are a hard-working and industrious people. This spirit was abused by kings and demagogues for centuries.\""

 asy.16.title:0 "The Patriarch and the Pope"
 asy.16.desc:0 "The clink of Peroni longnecks signalled the beginning of a lazy afternoon in the Roman Trastevere. Workers joined their bourgeois bosses in the terraces of cafés and in chairs set up in the small plazas that dotted the older quarters of the city, sharing laughs and heated political debates as if they had always been comrades. It was a moment of rest for everyone, enjoying the glimpses of the sun that peeked out from in between the last clouds of the day before a starry and clear night. The idle chatter was interrupted by the sudden arrival of a small swarm of young children, running and frantically jumping around every table and corner. With wide eyes and squeaky voices, they heralded an important message.\n\n\"Mori! Mori! Sonno arrivati!\"\n\nAlthough none of the Romans could make out what they meant by \"Moors\", the distant sound of trumpets and drums confirmed that something was indeed approaching. The blabbering stopped, and everyone turned expectantly towards the narrow street from where the kids had come from.\n\nThe smoke of burnt incense gave way to proud tanned horsemen in ceremonial attire, splendorous white and black robes with richly decorated turbans atop muscled Arabian horses. The initial shock caused more than one audible gasp. Behind them, a black Cadillac with the Assyrian flag on each headlight drove a young priest dressed in purple and gold, that offered the baffled crowd a solemn salute with a half-hidden smile. Trailing the Patriarch a legion of metropolitans and abbots from across Nineveh prayed loudly and in perfect unison, carrying standards of the Holy Virgin and a resurrected Christ on each flank. They were on their way to the Leonine City, a diplomatic and religious delegation to the Pope of Latin Christendom. It was the second time Assyrians had ever come to the Eternal City, and the previous time it was to formalise the Chaldeans in full communion with the Catholic Church just in time to participate in the Council of Trent. Recognising them as men of God most Romans had taken off their hats reverentially, and the more devout women were already on their knees. Some rosaries came out of the jacket pockets of many, awkwardly joining the Oriental extravagance of the Assyrian delegation with murmured Hail Maries. Unbothered, the Patriarch carried on towards his final destination. This same scene repeated three more times before they reached the Castel Sant'Angelo, dressed in banners and penants to honor the visit of the Assyrian Church of the East."
