 ASY_DESC_MENU:0 "Born under Allied auspices after the idea of a united Euphrates valley was rejected, the Assyrian State is Europe's gift to the many Christian denominations that rose in arms against the Ottoman Empire during the Great War. Although notably underdeveloped save for spare British and Russian backed relief and investment, it enjoys a harmonious tribal society overseen by the Patriarch of the Church of the East, His Holiness Shimun XIX. This theocratic stagnancy has recently come under attack by modernising efforts from within, and now Communists, religious reformers, and Generalissimo Petros await for a chance to bring Assyrians into the 20th century before a foreign power does it themselves."

However, other significant Christian groups also exists within the minds of the Assyrian people, the Jacobite and Chaldean Christians.

 asy.1.desc:0 "Gasping breaths and wrinkled hands grasping at white cloth set the scene for the death of the Patriarch. Tortured by coughing fits followed by the splatter of blood, everyone knew he was he dying. He knew he was dying. And yet, he could barely say a word, his throat too ached to even vomit some memorable last words. He couldn't even voice his word when the priest came to administer the last rites just some hours before. He could only desperately clutch the wooden crucifix and nod vigorously. The scorching sun that had invaded the room burnt his skin and made his trembling body sweat. Christ had endured thrice the terrible agony he was suffering, but Shimun Benyamin couldn't even scream at the Heavens to take this cup away from his lips. He contented with suffocation and a salivating mouth that couldn't swallow the red-stained spit veiled behind his lips.\n\nDirectly in front of his feet, a severe Christ. Severe? Kind? It was impossible to tell with his dizzy eyes. He knew he could feel his immobile stare but couldn't make out the Messiah's expression. Was God judging him? Is that why it was taking so long for him to die? Had the Divine Judge not come to a decision yet? His mind raced back to the last thirty years, the Great War against the Sultanate and shrapnel splitting the sands in half, the corpses floating down the Tigris, a British ambassador shaking his hands. Had he not been a good shepherd? The flock, even the black sheep, were safe and taken care of. Maybe he could've done more. But being a Patriarch and a politician was so difficult. Dealing with tribal disputes, foreign industrialists, bandits at the borders, the poor in the cities, God! Thrice-named God! Incarnate God, Fatherly God, Ghostly God! He did the best he could! Why couldn't the He give relief and embrace him?\n\nWith the wringing of tensed muscles of Christ pierced by Longinus, the Patriarch crawled in his bed towards the wall in which Christ stayed silent. Choking in tears he made his way across the mattress and blankets, shooting pain in his ribs. He prostrated his almost-corpse facing Christ, but his thin arms couldn't support his own weight and fell face-first into a cushion. Rolling his body to face the ceiling, he could finally feel his soul escaping from his mouth. Blood flew from the sides of his lips down to his white luscious beard, pooling the whole bed in red. Last breaths, slow. A moan, a whimper. A single word.\n\n\"Alaha!\"\n\nSome minutes later, his wife opened the door of the room where she had left her husband to make peace with God. Ignoring the ghastly scene, she closed the blinds of the single window in the room before kneeling before the bed and caressing her beloved's hand one last time. This last reunion between lovers was drowned out by the cymbals and trumpets outside that signalled the death of the Patriarch. These would be the most trying times of the young Assyria, now orphaned."

 asy.2.desc:0 "A solemn funerary march made its way across a silent Mosul, flanked at each side by paid mourners who whined and cried loudly and threw themselves at the Patriarch's hearse. Richly dressed men rode horses and camels at the front and back of the procession, letting out the soft clinks and clanks of bells tied around their mounts' necks. The serene moving tableaux had not yet reached the law courts in the central plaza when tragedy became a battlefield. Freydun Atturaya's boys were holding a protest, as well as a varied assortment of clubs and knives, calling for dissolution of the government and immediate elections now that the Patriarch was dead. The chieftains on horseback let out bellows and insults the second they came into view, and after a brief exchange of unpleasantries the communists charged forward against the procession. Cymbals crashing in the air and the smell of spilled incense overwhelmed the previous quietude, as more and more men came from all corners of the city to join in the fray. Beatings and kicks and stabs and slashes and trampling and screams alerted the tribes that had set camp in the aerodrome on the outskirts, and they were in turn followed by the uniformed militias of the Assyrian Socialist Party.\n\nThe primitive scuffle was interrupted by the coming of modernity: a shell fell from the heavens and struck an empty field no too far away. A warning. On the other side of the Tigris a military battalion had occupied the bridge and taken positions across the riviera, threatening to take the city by assault. Runners crossed Mosul up and down and everywhere, and within minutes the situation had cleared: the soldiers were Agha Petros' praetorian guard, while his main contingent chased off regiments still loyal to the Patriarch in the outskirts of the industrial belt. Some laughs and handshakes sealed the deal: the battalion moved in with unstoppable force across the main avenue and flooded through every street, crushing the tribesmen and aiding the socialists wherever they found them.\n\nThe battle had barely lasted a day, but by dawn the dust hadn't yet settled. Confusion reigned in the streets as the last scuffles died down and partisans rushed to save their injured and carry away the dead. But what had happened? Had the priests in the faraway chapels managed to wrangle together the tribes to put down the rebellion in the capital and solidify the rule of the Church? Or were the socialists and nationalists triumphant in unshackling Assyria once and for all?"

The stone innards of the Rabban Hormizd Monastery -which the Chaldeans had allowed the Church of the East to use as a gesture of goodwill- were claustrophobic and dark, but it was thought sheltering the mortal remains of Shimun Benjamin from the sun was the best choice. The poor old man had been a living saint to the many Assyrians who had known no Patriarch but him in their lifetimes, and to the zealous he was a third father after their blood father and the Father in Heaven. Thousands upon thousands of young tribesmen and travellers from Mosul and Erbil waited across the steps and outskirts of the centuries-old monastery, and further beyond the horizon was nothing but a sea of colourful tents from the pilgrims themselves.\n\nThe preparations fulfilled, the rite began, and the bishops slowly read off a Bible that rested on top of a bowing young man. For hours songs and proclamations in Aramaic, the tongue of Christ and His Apostles, drowned the Niniveh plains in a beatitude never felt in centuries. Our Fathers and Hail Marys pierced the sky incessantly, the most delightful descriptions of Paradise broke the faithful in trembling awe, and remembrance of past decades under the watchful eye of the departed Patriarch left all Assyrians impregnated with the feeling of being participants of an event of true Biblical proportions. Processions struggled to shoulder each other in a race to leave offerings of flowery garlands and other valuables, as ecstasy and repose intermingled in an aura of undisputed holiness.\n\nThe rite passed from funerary elegy to celebratory coronation. The young man dressed in simple white robes whom the extravagant metropolitans had used as an atrium rose, and with elegant strut sat in a gilded chair to the right of the defunct. In silvery and melodic voice Shimun Eshai began to speak, and cries across the precinct repeated his words for the gathered multitudes.\n\n\"In this holy man we placed our every hope. Now orphans we like Christ after the death of Saint Joseph, us Assyrians shed bitter tears for Shimun XIX Benyamin and pray for his eternal rest. And yet the birds go on singing, the waters of the Tigris flow, and day and night follow each other. I warn you: our country and our Church stand at the edge of a great precipice. Foreign powers threaten us as we brethren tear each other to shreds! Mosul is still recovering from the uprising! It is our salvation to become a new Assyria; united and all-encompassing, all-welcoming and all-loving. An Assyria of priests and peasants, tribes and technicians, bureaucrats and butchers: this is my oath to you and to him.\" Eshai had stood up and signalled to the wooden coffin, his face torn and his eyes watery. \"Let all sons of Christ be welcome in our project! Open the gates for the followers of Luther, for the Chaldeans, for the Jacobeans, for the Orthodox, as our halls are wide and our eyes see nothing but love!\"\n\nHe then knelt, and as Mar Eshai Shimun XXII’s peers laid their hands in consecration and he passionately kissed the cold hands of his predecessor; the crowd became a sea of cheers and chants."

Over the past week cohorts of workers had come from all across the Nineveh plains to aid the reconstruction and cleanup after the battle that earned them their liberty: bricklayers had repaired the buildings that suffered from careless artillery, military vehicles wheeled across the pavement guaranteeing peace, and the last injured from the makeshift hospital in the aerodrome had been discharged or transferred. This ambience of urban vigour had contributed to a steady rise in morale. Many had feared it'd just be the peace before the storm, but instead of harassment by rain of fire and brimstone Assyrians had found themselves zapped with electrifying thunder: the upcoming elections.\n\nThe prospect of self-determination, although brainy and romantic, had managed to rapture the passion of many young men. They now flocked to the capital in droves, seeking to join a political organisation and aid the newly born republic. Even when the brave made speeches in makeshift platforms in favour of this and that and the stupid tried to kick-start their own parties, soon it became absolutely apparent that Assyrian politics were Manichean.\n\nOnly two options remained for most: the Assyrian Democratic Party and the Assyrian Socialist Party. The former's name, to the amusement of the more cynical, was rather euphemistic: the Democrats mindlessly followed their headman Agha Petros and were mostly members of the army. Although they proved willing collaborators with the Assyrian Socialist Party and so far had shown nothing but goodwill towards liberalisation, their priorities laid elsewhere. Great dreams of an Assyrian Empire had taken over generalissimo Petros's imagination, promising to transcend petty tribal identity with an appeal to Sennacherib's conquests - only with a radically modernised industry and riding tanks instead of chariots.\n\nThe other option, the aforementioned Socialists, had another way of seeing things. Assyrians, yes, need to modernise - but chasing ziggurats in the sky was for fools. What the people needed was a true nation, not an appendage of the Church. Peace, land, and bread: this was the promise of Freydun Atturaya. A true-born patriot and socialist since the Great War, Atturaya defended with stern words the Assyrian national homeland as defined by his Urmia Manifesto, not the petty rump state the Tzarists and British had delivered. With contacts among the red movement in Russia, the Socialists promised an Assyria in the world stage in brotherhood with other liberated peoples.\n\nElections came faster than anyone anticipated. Cars and mules from cities arrived last minute with thousands of forgotten votes, positions were sold and bought, campaign continued at the footstep of ballot boxes, and the general chaos made for quick and sloppy elections. And yet, it was Assyria's first conscious decision for itself, emancipated from oppressive Patriarchs and foreign domination. Recount after recount, the final national assembly was set up, and an undisputed victor was chosen from the two main currents."

However, there's trouble.\n\nPossibility of local headquarters opening in Ninweh city or Beth Nohadra is unlikely. Despite our more optimistic projections, General Petros' distrust for the British Empire has not endeared him to us either.

The only thing that man loves more than his own country is war.\n\nSome gifts here and there, some promises, some connections to \"suppliers\" in the States... I believe we can cut ourselves at least a 30% portion of the cake after some initial investment. Hear me out: 30% is not little.

Ravaillac has earned his sympathy through expensive imported handguns, winning us eyes over several projected plans. His territorial ambitions put even M. Augier to shame. Military development and expenditure continues to be his number one problem. I have asked le Quai for authorisation to offer the lending of military technicians and instructors to spare him the shame of entering Damascus with an army mounted on donkeys.\n\nM. Damiens noted the presence of a small team of Americans whom we learned were representatives from the TEXACO oil company that previously dealt with the Saadeh and Saudi governments. A certain Hubert XXXXXX visited ministries and offices along the city, and we suspect they plan to bribe and lie their way into a deal with the government over rumoured oil deposits in the northern plains. If our intentions are to permanently counter their influence, M. Damiens has found a rooftop in the city with direct line of vision to their hotel room, and a long-distance rifle already been acquired.\n\nWe have collaborated with Americans against the Anglos before in Syria, and if this happens to be a similar case we suggest and encourage sitting down with these representatives for an informal agreement among gentlemen. Taking into account CalTex's previous friendliness with German items in Arabia, we have also already begun employing mail carriers to send us their personal correspondence and wiretapped their telephone landline. Unless new government projections see our nation's entry into the global oil industry, we see no cause for further action at this time."

 asy.14.desc:0 "We have successfully established relations with the revolutionary republic of Assyria. As most of the members of the new government are former members of our Party who speak Russian with ease, I have easily acquired an audience with comrade president Atturaya, to discuss in detail the relationship between our nations and the development of socialism in Assyria.\n\nOur talk was long and fruitful. President Atturaya has proven to be a man of intellect, knowledgeable in Marxist theory, to the point of making pedantic corrections of our \"unorthodoxy\", and well-acquainted with the situation in the Russian social-democratic movement, his sympathies laying with the Menshevik faction. However, his main ambitions remain national, and he has repeatedly stated that reclaiming Assyrian territory occupied by the Kurds will remain one of the main priorities of the socialist government. I have to also inform, with regret, that he has shown little interest in the most revolutionary of our projects and lacks an understanding of new perspectives that Futurism would open to the Assyrian revolution.\n\nWhile comrade Atturaya is not willing to compromise his Menshevist program of socialist construction, nor to break his party’s association with the Spartakist International, he is open to cooperation with the Caucasian federal authority in the task of expanding the proletarian revolution in Eurasia. Particularly, he has informed me of large petroleum deposits discovered in the north of his country, which he believes to be a key resource necessary in the proletarianisation of his feudal homeland.\n\nComrade Atturaya has proposed the establishment of a cooperative petroleum syndicate that would unite the industry in our nations, as he wishes to acquire the technical expertise of our personnel employed in the Baku fields. I urge the commissariat to consider this proposal and present it before the economic planning bureau.\n\nThe Caucasian involvement in the development of Assyrian petroleum industry is paramount to securing our position as the monopolist of fuel production in the revolutionary world. I have received reports of German agents in the area, who may wish to break out of dependence on the oil from Baku. Therefore, I again urge the central commissariat to consider comrade Atturaya’s proposal with the highest priority.\n\nPS: I have given comrade Atturaya several Futurist propaganda materials translated to Aramaic to distribute around Nineveh. I hope that will teach the philistines some culture."

Please, we have to get past at least the first chapter of Das Kapital today! And I'm a comrade, not a sire!\"\n\nSargon sat on top his makeshift desk defeated, barely finding the strength to keep holding the heavy book for a minute longer. With a sigh he let go of the tome and hung his head low. It has his third day living among these people, one of the many villages that dotted the southern lowlands near the Euphrates. He had been sent here by the party on the back of a camel, carrying a truckload worth of leaflets, books, photographs, posters, flags, and who-knows what else since he hadn't even had time to unpack everything yet. The people were kind and willing to learn at first (after they saw the crates of food some aides had brought along, no doubt), which deceived him into thinking it would be an easy task to proselytise about communism in the middle of nowhere. Most hadn't even heard the Patriarch had died until he rode along, and he somehow doubted they noticed the Ottomans had fallen or that there ever was a war that toppled their oppressors. He didn't even discount that at some point someone might ask him which Seleucid emperor was reigning. The other day an older man asked Sargon about his odd name, and he tried his best to hide his bafflement at how people who lived at the footsteps of ancient ruins had never heard of those who built them.\n\nLost in thought, he turned away to the portraits of Marx and Atturaya that now embellished the little plaza in which every tribesman was gathered for their daily lessons. He didn't even want to word what he thought of the situation, perhaps some colourful metaphor about neanderthals. The change from leaving to study in industrial Baku to living in developing Ninweh to this was almost too much. A tug in his trousers broke the pessimistic spell.\n\n\"Comrade Sargon, we really want to hear more of that city of wonders in the Caucasus. Please, we'll read two chapters next day, we promise!\"\n\nA young girl had stepped up from the crowd and gently grabbed the leg of his uniform. He couldn't help but smile. The previous outburst was nothing but stupid, these villagers weren't cavemen. They might use the formulas of old tyrants, read of Marx and Bebel as saints, even call Mayakovsky a \"mar\" as if he was a Patriarch; but they nonetheless understood. Intuitively, naturally, they understood the message. They knew of progress and industry, they knew of liberation and socialism; they just had no words for it. His task and hope was giving them the words to comprehend and interpret the world around them. It was that simple.\n\n\"Very well! I have already told you of the great iron city of Baku and the scientists of Tiflis, but here's something I haven't told you yet.\" The bored and frustrated villages began listening more attentively, and Sargon could see some sparks in curious eyes. \"To the far west there lies a country known as Germany, so vast not even from the top of Babel you'd see its end. The Germans are a hard-working and industrious people. This spirit was abused by kings and demagogues for centuries.\""

 asy.16.desc:0 "The clink of Peroni longnecks signalled the beginning of a lazy afternoon in the Roman Trastevere. Workers joined their bourgeois bosses in the terraces of cafés and in chairs set up in the small plazas that dotted the older quarters of the city, sharing laughs and heated political debates as if they had always been comrades. It was a moment of rest for everyone, enjoying the glimpses of the sun that peeked out from in between the last clouds of the day before a starry and clear night. The idle chatter was interrupted by the sudden arrival of a small swarm of young children, running and frantically jumping around every table and corner. With wide eyes and squeaky voices, they heralded an important message.\n\n\"Mori! Mori! Sonno arrivati!\"\n\nAlthough none of the Romans could make out what they meant by \"Moors\", the distant sound of trumpets and drums confirmed that something was indeed approaching. The blabbering stopped, and everyone turned expectantly towards the narrow street from where the kids had come from.\n\nThe smoke of burnt incense gave way to proud tanned horsemen in ceremonial attire, splendorous white and black robes with richly decorated turbans atop muscled Arabian horses. The initial shock caused more than one audible gasp. Behind them, a black Cadillac with the Assyrian flag on each headlight drove a young priest dressed in purple and gold, that offered the baffled crowd a solemn salute with a half-hidden smile. Trailing the Patriarch a legion of metropolitans and abbots from across Nineveh prayed loudly and in perfect unison, carrying standards of the Holy Virgin and a resurrected Christ on each flank. They were on their way to the Leonine City, a diplomatic and religious delegation to the Pope of Latin Christendom. It was the second time Assyrians had ever come to the Eternal City, and the previous time it was to formalise the Chaldeans in full communion with the Catholic Church just in time to participate in the Council of Trent. Recognising them as men of God most Romans had taken off their hats reverentially, and the more devout women were already on their knees. Some rosaries came out of the jacket pockets of many, awkwardly joining the Oriental extravagance of the Assyrian delegation with murmured Hail Maries. Unbothered, the Patriarch carried on towards his final destination. This same scene repeated three more times before they reached the Castel Sant'Angelo, dressed in banners and pennants to honor the visit of the Assyrian Church of the East."

 ASY_mountaineers_of_assyria_desc:0 "The land that we are limited to for now is filled with mountains and valleys. Some of the hardest terrain to fight in. Fortunately, this gives us a fantastic chance to train our men for future conflicts where we may need to fight in the mountains. Let us not risk getting bogged down in the future and risking the lives of more men than is necessary."
 ASY_negotiate_with_tribal_leaders:0 "Negotiate With Tribal Leaders"
 ASY_negotiate_with_tribal_leaders_desc:0 "The matter of self-determination and independence from Assyria by the Kurds has been a long standing issue of the Assyrian nation. However, by sitting down and negotiating with Kurdish tribal leaders and promising political concessions and autonomy we can hope to lower discontent and demands for independence among them."
 ASY_new_patriarch_is_elected:0 "New Patriarch is Elected"
 ASY_new_patriarch_is_elected_desc:0 "As expected, the people have wisely chosen to elect the Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai. Now that the war over Hakkari is over and done with, we can turn to running the country as normal and finishing the plans and reforms planned by upper members of the clergy that this country so desperately needs."
 ASY_pacify_the_country_side:0 "Pacify The Country-side"
 ASY_pacify_the_country_side_desc:0 "The restoration of Russian rule in Assyria has not been news that many have welcomed. Most resistance has come from Kurdish tribes seeking to establish their independence, but reports of Arabs, Assyrians and Turks rioting in response to the news have been coming in non stop. Needless to say, we cannot continue like this and must take radical action to unseat the hold of the nationalist mind."
 ASY_proclaim_equality_of_all_citizens:0 "Proclaim Equality of All Citizens"
 ASY_proclaim_equality_of_all_citizens_desc:0 "It’d be a lie to say that Assyria was a particularly inclusive nation before Petros’s coup against the reactionary and oppressive oligarchy that ruled over Assyria for so long. But this state of affairs shall be no more. Assyria shall not elevate the standing of any one group over any other. From now on, in the eyes of the government and in the eyes of the law all citizens of Assyria shall be equal. Whether they are Christian, Muslim, Kurd, Turk, Arab, rich, poor, male, female. It shall not matter. Assyria shall become the guiding light of the East. The light it was always meant to be!"
 ASY_progressive_taxation:0 "Progressive Taxation"
 ASY_progressive_taxation_desc:0 "Within our country, 1% of the population controls as much as 80% of its wealth. The vast inequality corrupting our beautiful state has been somewhat mitigated by our moves to socialise the Assyrian land. But this can only go so far. These oligarchs will still control great amounts of wealth even if the land is owned by the people. Thus to counter their oppressive hold on society we shall establish new tax rates. The poorer the man, the less he shall pay in taxes and the richer the man the more he shall give to society, instead of growing fat off of the labour of those beneath him."

And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”"

 ASY_put_end_to_the_kavkazs_madness_desc:0 "The greatest military threat was without a doubt the Armenian state. But ideologically speaking, the madness that rules in the Kavkaz society is far more twisted and dangerous to us. Luckily, we can be happy in knowing that they will likely not be able to put up much of a fight. But we should not let this fact get the better of us. They have the mountains to rely on after all. Thus, let us see to it that we remain vigilant, and reclaim our rightful territory."
 ASY_reorganize_the_caucasian_voluntary_army:0 "Re-organize The Caucasian Volunteer Army"
 ASY_reorganize_the_caucasian_voluntary_army_desc:0 "It has been decades since our brave men have seen combat. Many of course remember the training and experiences they saw through the War and violent breakup of the middle east. But if we are to successfully pull off our endeavour, we must re-organise our men into a horde of professional and elite troops!"
 ASY_republic_is_proclaimed:0 "The Republic is Proclaimed"
 ASY_republic_is_proclaimed_desc:0 "It appears that the goals of Agha Petros have not been as malicious as some have feared. Not long after the introduction of Martial Law, Petros has started to take steps towards liberalisation and the proclamation of a free Republic, ruled not by oligarchs and priests but by the people!"
 ASY_request_help_from_russia:0 "Request Help From Russia"
 ASY_request_help_from_russia_desc:0 "Assyria is not exactly the country in the greatest position for a re-conquest of the Caucasus. But we must work with what we have, even if it is not much. Of course, we can use who we are to convince our brothers in Moscow to send some guns and aid over to us to try and make the situation a little more bearable."
 ASY_return_baku:0 "Return to Baku"
 ASY_return_baku_desc:0 "Now that we have wrestled control over Armenia we have been able to successfully march into the fields of Azerbaijan. It was at first surprising that the Azeri population welcomed our men as they entered Baku and their fields. The reality of the situation set in when we discovered the acts of depravity and terror enforced by the Armenian state on the Azeri nation. The Azeri people are thus happy to be under the rule of an entity that does not seek their extermination. We can at least be happy about one thing then, that the integration of Azerbaijan will be far easier."
 ASY_return_that_is_ours:0 "Return That Which Is Ours"
 ASY_return_that_is_ours_desc:0 "We would be hypocrites if we unjustly attacked those lands which we have no business in. We must restrain ourselves to liberating our fellow Assyrians abroad. We shall be the bigger men and stay above these leeches and thieves."
 ASY_russian_advisors:0 "Russian Advisors"
 ASY_russian_advisors_desc:0 "The Russian Army was one of the most feared and strongest forces of the Great War. If our armies were to be trained by their commanders and generals, we surely would become a formidable force too!"
 ASY_secularize_the_state:0 "Secularize The State"
 ASY_secularize_the_state_desc:0 "As long as political power and influence is held by the clergy and the estate of the Church, we cannot hope to truly be a democratic state. We cannot become a democracy in name only, where our political candidates are little more than mouthpieces for the clergy, where individual churches and priests command their “flock” to vote for this or that political party, irrespective of their own individual beliefs. Thus, we must make sure that the Church and the State are separated. Our laws shall not be governed by any religious text and the churches shall not dominate our government! We shall be a beacon of democracy in a region filled with reactionaries and despots!"
 ASY_seek_armenian_support:0 "Seek Armenian Support"
 ASY_seek_armenian_support_desc:0 "The Armenians and us are not so different. We share a faith and a history of subjugation under the Ottoman Empire. With this in mind, let us reach out to our friends in Yerevan so that we may be under their protection."
 ASY_socialize_the_land:0 "Socialize The Land"
 ASY_socialize_the_land_desc:0 "This soil, this land of our dear Assyria does not belong to any oligarch or exploitative landlord. It belongs to the only people it can belong to. The people! This is the Assyrian nation and the Assyrian people must collectively own it, so that we may march forward to a progressive, democratic and Socialist state!"
 ASY_start_the_caucasus_liberation_campaign:0 "Start The Caucasus Liberation Campaign"
 ASY_start_the_caucasus_liberation_campaign_desc:0 "The Armenians are by far the greatest threat to our plans to recover the Caucuses for Russia. If we are to emerge victorious, this hurdle of hurdles must be overcome. Our goals shall be guaranteed if we strike the Armenian menace and raise our standard over the mountain of Ararat. Where Noah once walked, we shall walk as well!"
 ASY_study_the_great_war:0 "Study The Great War"
 ASY_study_the_great_war_desc:0 "It is often forgotten, but some of the most important battles of the Great War were fought here in the deserts. Whether they were in the straits of Gelibolu, the deserts of Kut-al amara or the mountains of Sarikamish. We have much to learn from these battles. Who knows? Perhaps one day, knowing these things will be the difference over life and death!"
 ASY_support_from_ASY_brothers_in_faith:0 "Support From Brothers In Faith"
 ASY_support_from_ASY_brothers_in_faith_desc:0 "Pleasant news has arrived today as the nations of Armenia, Centrocaspia and the South-Eastern Union have sent gifts and their best wishes to us upon hearing of the election of the patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai. This is hardly surprising given how all 4 of us have traditionally been Christian nations with many similar traditions. Still, the fact that it is predictable does not mean it is not welcome."
 ASY_support_manufactures:0 "Support Manufacturers"
 ASY_support_manufactures_desc:0 "Due in no small part to the large rural population of Assyria, some of our main produce is cloth, wool and cattle. These are trade goods that are in high demand across the world and we stand to gain quite a bit if we were to expand our production of said goods."
 ASY_support_the_assyrian_colonists:0 "Support The Assyrian Colonies"
 ASY_support_the_assyrian_colonists_desc:0 "Genocide and oppression have led to the Assyrian population being forced out of the lands they used to occupy. This will not do! The status quo must change radically. We shall force out those who have replaced us and introduce Assyrian settlers into the newly reconquered territories."
 ASY_tax_reform:0 "Tax Reform"
 ASY_tax_reform_desc:0 "The state of the Assyrian finances and income is, truthfully, not the best it could be. Our tax system is woefully inefficient with foreign business not even needing to pay a dime to us! This obviously cannot continue. We must set about reforming the system of taxation so that these blunders may be distant memories of the past."
 ASY_terms_of_elections:0 "Terms of Elections"
 ASY_terms_of_elections_desc:0 "Now that the struggles of the past have come to an end. The Assyrian people can look forward to a period of prosperity where they themselves rule. However, there has been one issue that has delayed the elections. Protests have broken out across the country (mainly by Kurds but also other more liberal groups) demanding universal suffrage for all people in Assyria. There has been some opposition to this movement who have cited the recent uprising by Kurdish militias and groups as a reason for them to not be allowed to vote in the election as they have so far only worked against Assyria."
