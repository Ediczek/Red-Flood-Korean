 RPR_moderate_industrialisation:0 "온건한 산업화"
 RPR_moderate_industrialisation_desc:0 "Persia is not only regressive socially and politically, but economically as well. What little industry we have was built primarily for the benefit of the British and exists solely to extract oil.

In the years leading up to the civil war, the Jangal earned fame and influence, using widespread unrest to their advantage. After the 1st Session of the Worker’s Council, the Jangal rallied enough support, to take power and get rid of the Tudeh. Their rule secured means it’s time for a new era for Persia."

 RPR_nationalists_socialists_persians:0 "민족주의, 사회주의, 페르시아인"
 RPR_nationalists_socialists_persians_desc:0 "The Jangal party unites three distinct ideas: nationalism, socialism, and Islam, under one banner.

 RPR_liberate_our_eastern_brothers_desc:0 "With the revolution against the Shah secured, we must begin to look outwards towards the liberation of our brethren.

 RPR_freedom_of_the_caucasians_desc:0 "With our eastern brothers liberated, our next move must be towards the west. The Caucasus, once the playground of the Persians, Turks, and Russians, now exist in a state of disarray. This ranges from the sham democracy of the Armenians to the Azeri dogs who have troubled us so.
