 news.1.d:0 "The 24 Heures Du Mans is an automobile race that has been held yearly in Le Mans, France since 1923. Although the tradition began before the coup that placed Artaud in power, the Avant-Garde French government has enshrined this tradition as a patriotic display of both modernization and speed, and cherish the opportunity to demonstrate their technological superiority over their rivals, particularly Germany.\nThe stakes at this year's event were particularly captivating, as it marked the first time in the history of Le Mans that two nations with opposing modes of production would compete against one another. Representing the French was the Bugatti corporation, who were given large amounts of investment and support from the Futurist government after swearing loyalty to the Avant-Garde state, as well as benefiting from the corporatist structure of the economy. On the opposite end of the spectrum was the Deutsche Automobilgewerkschaft, a stand-in organization for the Germans, who did not have any corporations with which to participate otherwise. Instead, the German team consisted of hand-selected trade union members alongside their representatives, who were present in order to ensure that the labor involved in preparing for the race met German labor condition standards, despite all proceedings taking place on French soil.\nOther participants included Bentley of the United Kingdom, Alpha Romeo of Italy, and Ford of the United States. The Ford and Alpha Romeo companies were in fierce competition, with the quality-over-quantity philosophy of Alpha Romeo going toe-to-toe with the ingenious productive capabilities of Fordism. Ultimately, Bugatti came in first place, with the German DA coming in a narrow second, with the remaining teams ranking as follows; Alpha Romeo in third, Bentley in fourth, and finally, Ford coming in last place. These results led to German fans accusing the French of cheating, and a violent brawl taking place in the crowd. Eventually the crowd had to be dispersed, and both France and Germany issued official statements of condemnation for the violence that took place."

All across the empire, cities such as Vienna, Prague, and even Laibach have broken out in socialist uproar, and barricades have been constructed from street to street. Violence and counter-violence alike have spread throughout the country, as both imperial forces and German nationalists have begun to brawl with the communist agitators.\n\nThe first victim of the violence was none other than the newly-crowned Kaiser, Karl I. On his way to coronation in Prague, his motorcade was shot at by Czech independence activists with ties to the Austrian left, leaving him wounded. While the severity of his injuries are yet to fully manifest, this has left the Empire, temporarily, without a head, and in this vacuum the realm has begun to tear itself to shreds."

 news.3.d:0 "Stability in Central Europe is jostled today as news breaks of the death of the Kaiser Franz Ferdinand I. The reformist monarch had massive shoes to fill upon the death of his uncle Franz Joseph in 1916, as the man was practically an institution himself, and the Great War threatened to shatter the whole of Austria-Hungary. Though the stresses of war and the consequences of trying to quiet Slavic discontent would almost destroy the state, the order in Vienna endured. The core of Austria held back Italian advances long enough to broker a peace with the Entente, and stop revolutionary Germans, Hungarians, and South Slavs from overtaking what remained. \n\nBut now, the Kaiser who practically represented Austria rising from its darkest hour is dead, evidently of a heart attack. There is much speculation on what comes next, given his nephew and heir's public image as an ardent reformer in a similar vein, and the agitation of republicans and socialists against the Hapsburg throne in general."

When a Kurdish battalion made an encampment a few kilometers north of the border, they came under fire from Turkish battalions, accusing them of an attempted incursion. Abdülmecid II called for the army to stand down to avoid civil war, but the soldiers marched on, sparking war with Kurdistan as they crossed the Euphrates, and in turn, the Rubicon.\n\nIn the chaos, the incursion spiraled into a revolution within the Anatolian heartland as guerrillas and revolutionaries joined the army with a fervour as strong as it is broad. Communists and Islamic Socialists, Futurists and Anarchists, Romantic Nationalists and Republicans carrying the Kemalist legacy joined with the army as the winds of change lashed the Empire. Despite last minute attempts at compromise, with the Commission evacuating the Strait, Abdülmecid II declared the East to be in open revolt and, raising his standard at Dolmabahçe, called for all loyalists to rally to the Empire's defence.\n\nAs brother takes up arms against brother, the Turkish nation begins to prepare for dark days indeed. Only time will tell now if the flames of revolution will burn down the sick man, or if the forces of reaction will hold back the mountains of change."

It appears that these injuries, thought to be minor, contributed to his ailing health, although his death still came as a shock to many.\n\nOriginally hailing from Russia, Lenin was expelled from his native Social Democratic Party by leader Aleksandr Bogdanov in 1907. From there, he travelled to Switzerland, and in 1918, he served in both the Hungarian and German revolutions, settling in Berlin and serving as Foreign Minister. Yet in 1928, Lenin broke from the German SPD, citing claims of \"revisionism,\" and formed his own party, the Communist Party of Germany. Upon his death, the party will have to select a new leader, for it seems the sands of time wait for nobody, including those larger than life."

In his rhetoric, Ortega mixes liberalism with nationalist sentiments: bringing on a national rebirth of Spain as a modern, truly secular, and technologically advanced country. In terms of policy, he has promised to strengthen the central government, arguing for the necessity of such measures to rebuild the country that has been devastated by war.\n\nYet Ortega's ascendance has brought protests from the left: already he has been called a Regenerationist in disguise and an inspirer of Futurist madness hiding under the mask of a civilized liberal.

Today, Fernando de los Ríos has proven otherwise.\n\nFernando de los Ríos' tireless work rebuilding the trust the PSOE had lost over the years finally paid off, as he has been elected President of Spain by a comfortable majority. Extremely devoted to the party, he has always been a moderate among his peers and a firm believer in the supremacy of the social-democratic project above all other strategies. In his own words, his policy will focus on the agrarian issue, unresolved because of the war, and education reform.\n\nHowever, Fernando de los Ríos serves a mistress besides Spain. His loyalty to the party has led to what seems to be the beginning of the construction of an unstoppable, fierce political machine by any means necessary. Already, concerns over the sway of party politics in the new administration have been raised, and possible cases of corruption as a way of creating solid bases in civil society have begun to bloom."

President de los Rios now eyes his longstanding goal of having the PSOE welcomed back into the Second International - with more than just trepidation. Socialism at home, socialism in the world!\n\nThe PSOE has secured a hegemonic position since the end of the civil war. De los Ríos' brand of humanistic socialism can still thrive in this land, even after the long nightmare of his party playing collaborator to dictators. The project of agrarian reform, though it threatened to reignite civil conflict, has passed its initial teething pains to begin resolving the questions of land in Spain. Coupled with the modernization of Spanish education, it appears the great urban-rural political divide in Spain between reactionary and republican might no longer be as unbreakable as it once was.\n\nBut those smiles of victory are plastered atop a messier reality. The PSOE's machine of patronage and clientelism speaks for itself at this point, being a sword party factions wield to dispense appointments and favors.

There is a perhaps justified worry that this means a drastic change in the Republic, as the first rightist government in its history has the Sisyphean task to decide whether they will work by the rules of democracy and help it bloom as a multiparty system, or go against it from within to create a project of their own."

And now, experienced in forming \"dual power\" with Madrid, the Unión de Hermanos Proletarios is ready to renew the Spanish revolution.\n\nWhile critics of Ortega are quick to applaud, Caballero's ascent has placed a great question mark over the Republic itself.

The PSOE's attempts at agrarian reform have angered the rural oligarchy, who have taken it as a personal attack against their whole caste. On top of this, the increasing secularization of education and public life has prompted a great Catholic reaction in the polls, as the countryside has seen an unprecedented mobilisation of voters across the whole Republic.\n\nThe most traditionalist, atavic, aggressive form of the Spanish right has taken control, and their only goal is to destroy, brick by brick, everything about the current system.

The gap Díaz has left in the Republic will apparently be filled by Andrés Nin Pérez.\n\nThe Catalan firebrand does not just owe his newfound power to striking first, however. President Nin's vision of a rejuvenated communist republic, heralded by a new constitutional convention, was enticing for party militants demanding a demolition of the old institutions. His intention to forge the political scene into a single vanguard party has also been a balm to those who were deeply worried with the developing factionalism under Díaz. Finally, while the right of the PCE protested vigorously, the President's amenability to regional autonomy and concerns was attractive to the party's local groupings. All of this combined to allow the party left to outsmart its opponents, barely avoiding being skinned alive for their impudence.\n\nWith Andrés Nin's victory, it seems the revolution is passing to its youth.

Vladimir Gulidov, formerly General Kornilov's aide, overthrew his superior in a militaristic frenzy and now uses his own men as a ruthless tool to rule the Empire. \n\nAlready the Regent of all Russia, as Gulidov calls himself ever since his refusal to share rulership with a Romanov, has ordered his men to the frontiers of Russia to hound rebel and tsarist remnants, as well as place a thumb on the \"disloyal\" peoples of the country. The Russian Empire, once the undisputed master of great armies, has been brought to submission by her own troops."

The pro-SNPP forces have assassinated not only the leader of the Slovak Socialist Republic, Antonín Janoušek, but also the visiting Béla Kun, seemingly hoping to cause a similar shift in Hungarian politics. While it is known that Hlinka's movement is funded by the Austrians nearby, what isn't known is the Austrian stance on the recent events, and if the action was coordinated beforehand.\nNevertheless, the world seems to look forward to new developments in Slovakia."

Many thought that the takeover of power by a moderate party of the SJNK coalition would guarantee peace in this part of Europe. However, today’s triumphal parade has led people to question the peaceful intentions of Ljubo Leontić, the new Vođz of the South Slavs. Despite the many similarities between the Carnaro Regency and the Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists, Leontić's rhetoric is strongly anti-Italian. The government in Rome advises Italy against leaving Yugoslavia, and has stated that it will not allow such threats and harm to Italians. \n\nIt is suspected that the increasing friction between Yugoslavia and Italy could lead to war, as earlier Italian pirates were known to attack Yugoslav civilian ships and D'Annunzio himself has carried out a series of flamboyant provocations on the Italian-Yugoslav border.

The revolutionary government's crackdowns on the triads and remaining feudal lords have reaped a whirlwind, causing a violent uproar among the rural populace who were uncertain about the new regime. The government's refusal to back down evidently ignited a full-fledged peasant revolt, one that destroyed the fragile order of the NVF.\n\nThe crisis culminated in the capture of Saigon by triad forces, led by the popular mystic Phan Xích Long. With surprising brutality, many important figures were summarily executed by hanging or even stoning. In the wake of the bloodshed, Long, claiming descent from the Emperor Hàm Nghi, was crowned as the new emperor of Indochina. Invoking the names of the Ming dynasty, this new sovereign proclaims that Heaven had sent him to repel the foreign barbarians and cleanse the country of their corrupting ideals."

The party is led by the linguist Zainal Abidin bin Ahmad, better known by the moniker Za'aba, who until recently remains an obscure figure amongst the populace.\n\nGroomed since childhood to be an ulema, he would nevertheless delved into the realm of politics during the early years of the Federation. In the government's attempt on racial integration, he saw an opportunity to reinvigorate the fossilized Malays. The Malays can no longer afford to lag while other races continue to ascend politically and economically. Za'aba identified two major societal ills that shall no longer be tolerated: traditional Islamic beliefs that have long since deteriorated from the original purity and excellence, and feudal oppression committed by their own ruling class. He promised a return of Islam as a progressive force, no longer as an anchor that impedes his people.\n\nAlready he found strong resistance among traditional Malay religious and political leaders, who vowed to oppose any attacks to their forebears' customs. Tough roads lay ahead for the Prime Minister, but Za'aba is resolute in his will to drag the Malays to the future, kicking and screaming if he must."

Following the collapse of Japan into civil war, few expected any large impact to come to Zheltorossiya; however, the fall of the Japanese empire prompted complete disarray in the largely Japanese-owned Zheltorossiyan railways. As Japanese companies failed, many cities went without food or goods and thousands of workers were laid off. With the chaos, blame fell squarely on Aleksandr Kerensky.\n\nAs the economic crisis went on and on, more and more pressure piled on Kerensky to resign and for new elections to be held. It was under these conditions that Kerensky made the decision to resign. But Zheltorossiya is no closer to being unified or stable. The economic crisis, while having slowed down, still ravages the nation, and radicalized workers begin to call for a complete revolution against the system that failed. A sense of uncertainty and instability still plagues the country as the countdown to the elections begin, as it will not be long until the fate of the Russian Republic is decided once and for all."

Yet despite all odds, it appears as though the founding father has pushed back, withstanding the storm and becoming one in his own right with the dissolution of the Soviet.\n\nLong considered by many to be in the pocket of the Japanese, Kerensky's stagnant rule stood on shaky ground, and with the fall of the Shinto state, the Supreme Soviet attempted to have him stand down so they could seize control. This gambit was rejected by Kerensky, with the motion of no confidence being voted down by his backing coalition. Soon after, the Soviet was dissolved, and emergency rule declared in Harbin as Zheltorossiya was put under martial law.\n\nAs opposition leaders are huddled into holding cells and strikes broken up, many wonder if the sense of stability offered by Kerensky would withstand his own might. Nevertheless, it appears as though Kerensky shall stay, for better or for worse."

A product of the compromises between Germany and Poland, the strategic port has generally been seen as a symbol of cooperation between the Rotfront and the Intermarium, dubbed the Warsaw Pact. Unfortunately, it appears the delicate balance of political and economic interests has been upended.\n\nAs the old Marshal in Warsaw died and Germany became occupied by the fallout of the Red Week, the SPFHD was suddenly isolated against its traditional foes on the far-right. Many politicians - both outside and within the city - had long suspected these movements were funded by Prussia, but despite their jarring rhetoric, there was no legal pretext to crack down on them.\n\nAfter the DSP's surprising victory in the elections of 1937, their forces in the city marched on the Volkstag to attempt a coup against the Social Democrats and, ostensibly, invite Prussian soldiers in. It appears that their haste to act led to a disorganized effort that was quickly scattered by the head of the Polish Garrison in Danzig - Gustaw Orlicz-Dreszer. Orlicz-Dreszer, hailed as the new hero of the city, has established a provisional government to stabilize the situation in the aftermath."

The Warsaw Pact's prodigal son evidently sees no point in changing that.\n\nDespite the SPFHD's domination in the Volkstag, many MPs of the party have questioned the current course. The sizable bloc of trade unionists are the most notable to voice concerns, wishing to have more say in how the government operates in furtherance of Chairman Julius Gehl's past agreements between the SPFHD and the city's labor organizations.\n\nRegardless, the not-so-new government of Danzig has announced no plans for changing their economic policy, as this so-called Hanseatic Socialism has brought prosperity to the city and made it a shining Kautskyite success. Yet questions still linger, those of political liberalization, winning over wayward workers, and managing the Prussian-backed dissidents--although the Pact nods, the political course of the city government is still far from settled.

Danzig's patrons are faced with a fait accompli: the new German Social Party government of Arthur Greiser has affirmed the city's loyalty to its neighbors, but he has indicated that the victory of DSP shows the Germans of the city are looking to their past for a new future, a sentiment that has caused some distress in the Polish Garrison.\n\nGreiser's ascension to Senatspräsident was followed by DSP paramilitaries joining ranks with the police to put down riots and brawls. Already, the main trade unionists have announced their firm opposition to the DSP, and many fear that despite assurances of loyalty to the Warsaw Pact, Danzig will be in Prussian hands soon."

It has now unified all of China after a long period of internal strife and has upset the global scene, challenging the Boreal Bear and the Occidental Powers.\n\nFor millennia, the Oriental Dragon has thrived. However, it was deceived by thieves from the Occident who stole its pedestal and honor. Now, it has risen anew and it stands stronger than ever. The Chinese nation, a solitary force, forges ahead into the future, with Lingxiu Zeng at its helm."

 news.310.desc:0 "300 years ago, the rule of the Ming dynasty had come to an end after their defeat at the hands of the invading Manchus in the Northern plains of China, and with it, came the end of many centuries of native rule, and the beginning of foreign domination of China. By the time of the enforcement of the 21 demands onto the Beiyang, most international observers assumed that China was merely doomed to live in the shackles of foreign powers.\n\nHowever, following the failure of the Japanese to secure China, a new and unexpected force burst onto the scene. Consisting of unorganised armies of upstart peasants against Beiyang tax collectors and fanatical Millenarians preaching for a return to an idealised Chinese Golden age, the \"Yellow Sand Society\" was at first thought to be nothing more than a localised and rural insurgency with delusions of grandeur. But following several surprising victories, the Yellow Sand swept across the plains of Northern China, gaining support among the peasantry and various sects of Chinese nationalists who grew disillusioned with the Guomindang. And now, after a gruelling campaign in the rugged valleys and crooked mountains of Southern China, which served as the rock of resistance against so many empires and invaders in the past, the Yellow Sand society has, against seemingly insurmountable odds, triumphed over the petty despots of warlord territories and republican claimants to the Middle Kingdom.\n\nIn an address to the nation from within the Forbidden City in Beijing, Daming declared that the nation of China had finally awoken from three hundred years of slumbering, and now, she would move the world. Promising an end to foreign domination in any corner of China and a return to the ways of the past that made China the centre of the world so long ago has made the Yellow Sands more popular among the people of China, but has drawn concerned looks from across much of the world. But despite whatever the wishes of meddling foreign powers may be, outside of stiff, but small, pockets of resistance in the South, the mandate of Heaven has been claimed yet again, and shows no signs of disappearing soon."

Such presumptions, however, are not so certain now, as a new power has taken its form, one that might tip the scales for the Empire.\n\nThe protectorates of northern Borneo have historically been neglected by their suzerain. Sarawak, Brunei, and North Borneo; these three states represent strangely enduring anachronisms, isolated pockets of absolutist and company rule that survives into the present. Their inclusion into the ill-fated Federation was an attempt to modernize and integrate these institutions, as independent existences were seen as impossible. But now, in a mix of idealism and desperation, northern Borneo stands on its own following the formation of a confederation of all British protected states in the region.\n\nEstablished as a federal constitutional monarchy, the infant nation is headed by Rajah Anthony of the White Rajahs of Sarawak, who only recently succeeded his uncle. In his coronation speech, the young monarch affirmed his lofty ambition to make the Confederation a model state of the Commonwealth. It remains uncertain, however, if his Confederation would survive the trials ahead or be swept away like its precursor."

Believing himself to have a part to play in the great revival and reunification of Islam, he preached his teachings to anyone who would listen, amassing a loyal following among the natives. MacBryan's undertaking culminated in the popular seizure of the Astana and the overthrow of the Rajah in favor of him, ending a century of Brooke rule in Sarawak.\n\nSeeming convinced that this new prophet would rule the populace better than the Brookes ever could, Britain accepted the takeover and conceded their remaining protectorates in exchange for his fealty. Now as his position secured, the White Sultan set about transforming his fiefdom into a beacon that shall guide the believers worldwide and bring forth a true Darussalam."

According to his words, Siam must reclaim all of its lost territories, and the country fully belongs to its great Thai people. At the same time, he has declared himself a \"Pan-Taiist,\" a relatively new term among the country's intellectuals who envision Siam as a regional powerhouse.
