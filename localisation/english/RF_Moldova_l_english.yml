#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_PANTEA_DESC:0 "Gherman Pantea, 공화국의 구원자, 키시너우의 시장, 그리고 이제는 몰도바 공화국 임시정부의 지도자. One of the founding figures of the Republic and the suppressor of the anarchist threat, Gherman Pantea has always been respected by the various ruling governments and the populace. And so, with the recent scandal that nearly plunged the country into complete chaos, it is he who was unanimously given the authority to restore and keep order until the upcoming June elections. He himself does not participate in the politickeering, instead being content with the mayoral seat in the capital, but he suspects that the task will require him to make some decisions that will have a lasting effect on the political landscape, even if he makes them just to calm down the population."
POLITICS_LUPU_DESC:0 "노동당의 chairman Nicolae Lupu는 started out his political career in the Kingdom down south as co-chairman of the SR-adjacent republican-leaning party, but with Gheorghe Diamandy's death right after the Russian Revolution, he has transformed the party in the Poporanist image. What motivated the move to Moldova, however, has been the immediate denouncement of the Republicans as traitors to the Kingdom, a move that placed Lupu, perhaps involuntarily, on the Schismatic side of the National Schism. The moderately successful Labor Party has now risen to power, however that rise came at a cost of many of Cocea's supporters flocking to the party, which in turn has modified its program, despite Lupu's vision. Now, Lupu aims to unite Greater Romania and retransform the Party back into a Poporanist one."
POLITICS_MOTRU_PRANK_DESC:0 "루마니아주의당의 당수 Constantin Radulescu-Motru는 is perhaps one of the more outlandish politicians of the Region, who to some is a Poporanist, to some is a Conservative, and to others he is entirely his own, enclosed, bubble. Residing in Iasi at the time of the establishment of the Republic, Radulescu-Motru saw no need to go back to the Kingdom, especially after making a quick calculation of chances of influencing something. After all, an anti-establishment republic would be prone to influence from new ideologies, and so he made an attempt at creating his own, dubbed \"Romanianism\". It did not see much following, partly because of the various anti-democratic tones to it. Over the years, Constantin changed his views, and now Romanianism is closer to Poporanism, with some viewing it as a successor to Stere's idea. Now, he seeks to unite Romania and modernize it under his vision."
POLITICS_MOTRU_DESC:0 "루마니아주의당의 당수 Constantin Radulescu-Motru는 is perhaps one of the more outlandish politicians of the Region, who to some is a Poporanist, to some is a Conservative, and to others he is entirely his own, enclosed, bubble. Residing in Iasi at the time of the establishment of the Republic, Radulescu-Motru saw no need to go back to the Kingdom, especially after making a quick calculation of chances of influencing something. After all, an anti-establishment republic would be prone to influence from new ideologies, and so he made an attempt at creating his own, dubbed \"Romanianism\". It did not see much following, partly because of the various anti-democratic tones to it. Over the years, Constantin has officially changed his views, however unofficially, he remained convinced in the first form of Romanianism. Now, given emergency powers, Constantin seeks to unite Romania in the Romanianist image, whatever it takes."
POLITICS_POPESCU_DESC:0 "보수-민주당의 당수 Stelian Popescu는 is primarily known for running the \"Universul\" newspaper. During the Russian Invasion he chose to follow Take Ionescu in establishing an entente-cooperative government, however unlike Take, he did not become convinced that a republic was needed, even after being officially condemned as a traitor after the establishment of the Republic of Moldova. For Popescu, the Republic is just what came to be in the aftermath. After Ionescu's death, the PCD almost ceased to exist, but Popescu, along with Nicolae Titulescu, managed to save the party, although they soon became divided on what the \"new\" PCD's program should be. Popescu himself advocated for a stronger emphasis on nationalism, while Titulescu advocated that they should remain \"true to Ionescu's vision\". Now, the PCD is the ruling force for the second time, seeking to finally reunify Romania before all else."
POLITICS_CODREANU_DESC:0 "대천사 미하일 군단의 악명 높은 Capitanul인 Corneliu Zelea Codreanu는 is a man that needs no introduction. From humble beginnings in Nicolae Iorga's Democratic Nationalist Party, through his service in the Great War, Codreanu's life has been nothing but sacrifice for the Nation. When A.C. Cuza left the PND, so did Codreanu, eventually joining him in his National-Christian Defence League, however Corneliu ended up leaving the LANC in 1926, believing it had little to no chance of ever conquering the hearts of Romanians. He immediately created his own movement, known as the Legion of Archangel Michael, which quickly gained support among the irredentist populace, seeking to reunify Romania under the reactionary, ultranationalist, banner. While he took inspiration from the Black Hundreds over in Russia, he did introduce a lot of his own elements, making the Legion a one-of-a-kind movement. In 1930, soon after King Ferdinand I died, Codreanu approved of Mihai Stelescu's plan to coup the Romanian government, however that failed and so the movement was forced to not only go to exile into Moldova, but also to adopt an entirely new strategy to succeed. His time in Moldova has landed him almost imprisoned and the Legion nearly outlawed, saved only by the recent scandal involving Nicolae Cocea. Now, he seeks not only to reunite Romania, but also to enact revenge - both on the traitor Stelescu and on the corrupt King Carol and his Liberal clique."
POLITICS_ELIADE_DESC:0 "대천사 미하일 군단의 새 Capitanul인 미르체아 엘리아데는 has for a long time experimented with various political ideas, but it was Codreanu's thought that eventually stole his heart. Oriented towards learning from his young years, he went on to study at the University of Bucharest, meeting Nae Ionescu, who had a great influence over the student's views. In 1927 he went to study in the Raj, at the University of Calcutta, sponsored by the Maharaja of Kassimbazar, but in 1930 he was forced to leave as the Raj was collapsing. He eventually made his way to Moldova, but was unable to cross the border back into Romania. Therefore, he went on to study again at the University of Iasi, where he published his thesis on Yoga practices and came into contact with the members of the Legion, and found that his views closely matched theirs, and joined the formation. While he never was fully on-board with Codreanu's program, he found the movement to be the only one able to reconcile Romania with God. Now, standing as the Capitanul after Corneliu's death and his quick election, he is taking steps towards a so-called \"Christian revolution\"."
POLITICS_CALLIMACHI_DESC:0 "몰도바 아나키스트 운동의 선두주자인 Scarlat Callimachi는 has only become relevant pretty recently with the chaos caused by the scandal involving Nicolae Cocea. His background as an anarchist revolutionary goes as far back as to 1907, when he first-hand witnessed the Peasant Revolt, which shaped his views for years to come. When the Republic of Moldova was founded, he became an associate of Ilie Catarau and together they almost managed to overthrow the government, with their plan stopped only by Gherman Pantea's intervention, which led to Catarau's death and the disappearence of any power they held. This, however, did not stop Scarlat, and for years he has tormented the Moldovan authorities, earning him the nickname of \"the Uncapturable\". Now he stands at the top, willing to continue what almost came to fruition those long years ago."

Due to the sudden downfall of his Social Democratic Party, people are flocking left and right, trying to find a new political option for them."
