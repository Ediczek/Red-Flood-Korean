 PRI_spiridon_merkulov_desc:0 "Out of the chaos of Zheltorossiya's political death struggle comes a scion of peace, order, and good government - or so we can hope. Spiridon Dionisovich Merkulov, the people's representative for Vladivostok, was born the younger of two brothers in a family of Amurian peasants. Despite his humble origins on the eastern fringe of the Russian Empire, the young man was able to pursue a legal education at Petrograd University, and play a number of roles as a lawyer, a functionary at the Ministry of Agriculture, and an insurance company employee. Spiridon also was briefly a Duma member before Stolypin's dismissal of the body, though the closest he would be to state power between then and the end of the Great War was working as a legal advisor to the municipal government of Vladivostok.\n\nConcerned at the reactionary counterblow at the end of the Great War, and already located in what would become the stronghold of the Russian Republic, the lawyer would find himself drawn into the revolutionary camp during the civil war. While not living out a story of flight along the Trans Siberian Railway or heroic addresses in the Soviet, becoming a representative for Vladivostok in the late 1920s would help anchor the liberal Kadets in the city. That being said, he was largely an undistinguished, if senior, statesman aligned with the mercantile interests of the port.\n\nThe course of events since Kerensky's fall heightened the divisions between Spiridon Merkulov and the rest of the revolutionary front. To him, when the radicalism and populism of the left front inevitably led to disaster, it vindicated the older guard among the Kadets. With the help of his brother and their connections between the party and local bourgeoisie, the new Prime Minister hopes to build a stable, liberal order to rally the fragments of the republic to. So begins the era of the Petrograd of the Pacific!"
 PRI_nikolay_merkulov_desc:0 "With the backroom deals and alliances accounted for, the former Prime Minister vacates the stage to welcome the iron hand of the market, Nikolai Dionisovich Merkulov. Like his brother Spiridon, Nikolai was born to a peasant family in Amur, in Blagoveshchensk. Rather than moving to Petrograd to further his education, he would graduate from the gymnasium in his hometown and rapidly transition into working as a merchant. Further differentiating himself from his brother, the elder Merkulov would stay purely in the realm of business, operating a shipping company on the Amur River and a match factory in Vladivostok, as well as being a long term member of the Vladivostok Stock Exchange Committee and Primorsky Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\nOf course, like his brother, facts of geography gave Nikolai a mighty push into the revolutionaries during the civil war. After all, the bourgeois leanings of the Kadets and even the Social Revolutionaries were more amenable to his aims than the Hundredist traditionalists, broadly speaking. While he remained a business figure in the exile republic, he would still support the party most suitable to his interests, watching the rise of the young wing of the Kadets under Alisa Rosenbaum with particular interest. And of course, there were rumours, unproven if somewhat credible, that he was willing to hire certain unsavoury types in the marginalized Zheltorossiyan right to disrupt union activity in Vladivostok.\n\nBut in the end, with the left inviting catastrophe from the hoi polloi, Rosenbaum going off the expected rails, and the Black Hundreds on the border, the time has come for Nikolai to do the job himself. Let no one say a savvy businessman lacks the wherewithal to get his hands dirty. While his brother will serve well to help set up the institutions of the new state, an even more pragmatic vision will animate his works, coupled with an ironclad alliance with Zheltorossiyan business. The people have had their chance - now it is time for those who actually know what they are doing to have their hands untied."

 PRI.1.desc:0 "The Duma gathered in Vladivostok town hall to discuss quite an important issue, which was the leadership of the young republic.  It was no surprise that there were only two serious candidates. Spiridon and Nikolai Merkulov. Few paranoid people commented on the situation as evidence of corruption, but few listened to them. Corrupt or not, they were the heroes who saved democracy from the yellow threat, red beast and Ukrainian terrorists. Nikolai Merkulov carefully watched the situation and counted each member of the Duma who entered the room. He was more direct than his brother, knowing that sometimes you have to get around the law and resort to violence. Spiridon waved him in front of him, most likely wishing him good luck. He was calmer than his brother, valuing justice and wisdom as the most important virtues. After a while, both brothers silenced the meeting, seeing that all those who were to appear had already entered the room. Spiridon started. \n\"We are here to take part in the democratic process. Democracy is an important part of the citizen's life. Elections are a celebration of democracy. Showing that democracy is the most perfect system, because it allows not only to praise what is wise and beautiful, but it allows everyone to work together for the benefit of the state.\" Nikolai, who was not a people person, continued after his brother, trying to do his best. He slapped his fist on the open palm and spoke firmly. \n\"However, democracy without security is only chaos and anarchy. So we have to make a quick leadership decision and go back to ensuring our situation. Good leadership in these difficult times is very important.\" Spiridon ended the short dual-speech. \n\"Therefore, my brother and I ask you to think carefully who you will choose and who will be the better candidate for this position. We have many problems to solve and, with my brother, I agree that a good leader is essential. Aristotle distinguished two types of democracy - Timocracy and Politeia. Timocracy was an ochlocracy, degenerated system that allowed cruelty to play a role in the government. Politeia on the other hand, as the righteous system, praised wisdom, it was the democracy of the wise. We intend to renew his words and we hope that all gathered here are above all righteous and wise and will choose according to their conscience.\" The whole hall rose to the two brothers who bowed almost theatrically. The vote began shortly after this speech. The counting of votes also went smoothly and both brothers at that time posed for photos or talked with the audience. After a short time, both brothers entered the center of the room again and..."
