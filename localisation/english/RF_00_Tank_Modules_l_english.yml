 modern_tank_chassis_desc:0 "A modernized chassis that borrows heavily from previous medium tanks, but puts a much bigger emphasis on speed and maneuverability, while also allowing for more armor and bigger guns than usually carried on medium tanks. The result is a vehicle that can fill a wide variety of roles."
 main_battle_tank_chassis_desc:0 "Experience has shown that the designs of light, medium, and heavy tank are converging more and more. heavy tanks have gotten more mobile, while light tanks are carrying heavier armament and armor to survive. there is therefore value in unifying all three designs into a single type, which will be a universal Main Battle Tank."

 armor_tech_1:0 "Basic Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_1_desc:0 "Tanks during the Great War only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armor. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."

 armor_tech_4_desc:0 "During the war, the threats faced by tanks have multiplied, from enemy tanks, anti-tank guns, dedicated tank destroyers, all the way to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges that can penetrate even heavy armor. We must develop new protection methods to keep our own tanks alive in the face of these threats."
