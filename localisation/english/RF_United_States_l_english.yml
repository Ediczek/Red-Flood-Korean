After that, the official swearing in procedure had to be held; a judge was found, along with a copy of the bible and a hardcover version of the Declaration of Independence.

However as they broke again to toy with their unwanted companion a coyote ran onto the road and went right under the wheel of the car, the sudden bump from the poor creature along with their front wheels sliding forward was enough for the car to start wheering. As Clyde desperately turned the steering wheel left and right the car only became more chaotic in its motion, soon after the car flew off the road, rolling into the sand top-down.

The St. Valentine's Day Massacre changed all that, however, leaving seven people dead and the public angered. And now, he has been cornered. His hideout in Wisconsin, a modest home belonging to some friends of the family, has been discovered thanks to some helpful locals filling the agents in on his day to day habits and schedule. Its likely to have at least some security, but the building itself is certainly not built for defense. The G-Men have the advantage in this case. Al Capone will not walk away from this house a free man; that is certain. The question, however, is what to do with him. Many in the bureau want him brought into custody; he may be a bastard, but he could possibly have information on the activities of other gangs that could be useful. Others are skeptical; they think that it may be better to just shoot him dead in order to scare off criminals thinking that crime pays. The choice is yours at the end of the day. "

The motive and identity of the attacker are unclear but mysteriously as disclosed by a maid who found his corpse in the morning at the nightstand lied a Mickey \"Black Mike\" Cochrane baseball card. When asked for any possible leads owner of the hotel said: \"If I was guessing it was probably one of those damn negroes he was hanging around.

Aside from the standard dross of boring speeches and oaths there was live music, as well as food prepared by the chapter's women's wing and massive amounts of fresh lemonade. \nCelebrations lasted till the late evening when without any warning crowd found itself under attack by yet to be identified perpatrators. According to witness testimonies a group of between three to six men, all clad in black cloaks began shooting at gathered with an assortment of firearms, supposedly including an automatic rifle. \nDespite swift return of fire by the always-armed klansmen none of the offenders were hit, most likely becouse of the low visibility.

Americans suggest complete support to the rebel coalition, being provided with all the arms and military equipment under our disposal to give them a fighting chance. However, Progressives and Republicans argue that the notion would put the nation closer to a civil war that would lead to a huge amount of casualties and even start a wave of Marxist terrorism in America, one that could even get the attenion of Germany.  As such, Progressive senators propose the alternative; provide some arms and money to the rebels just enough to cause some instability but not big enough to start a civil war, meaning the number of casualties will be lower but could still risk stagnation in progress. These two choices come with their own risks and consequences, so we must choose one that would benefit the nation the most, and to some extent, the region as well, lest we risk a bloodbath nearby."

Even after Disney's ascendancy, when his media would be constantly filling the ears of the population, children still craved even more content from America's favorite mouse. This day was no exception: after our leader himself announced that this cartoon would concern matters of national importance, even adults found themselves flocking to see the film. Before an audience of starry-eyed children and concerned parents, the cartoon began.\nA title card appeared, titled \"How to Be a Good American\", accompanied by jolly orchestral music. The scene then showed the mischievous Pete pacing around, clearly up to no good. He then was shown sneaking into Mickey's factory, which the mouse had bought in previous episodes, and talking to the workers inside. Pete began furiously shouting gibberish at them, which made the workers grow increasingly irate and riotous, and Pete encouraged them to go after their boss. At this point, several left-wing individuals in the crowd began to boo, but were immediately silenced by the enraptured crowd.\nPete soon led the crowd of angry workers throughout the building, smashing machines and robbing safes. At this point, the scene cut to Mickey, sleeping in his chair. A young girl was by him, clearly his secretary (as well as a stand-in for the children in the audience), when she noticed the commotion in the factory. She ran down, only to be greeted by Pete and the protesting workers. Pete tried to convince her to join them, but with her patriotic loyalty in full swing, she instead ran back upstairs to warn Mickey. Pete and his followers tried to intercept her, but were blocked by various cartoon obstacles and booby traps.\nThe girl ran into the office and woke up Mickey, warning him of the impending danger. Mickey immediately sat up and dialed his friends Goofy and Donald Duck to assist in warding off the protesters. As Pete and the workers finally approached Mickey's office, clearly scuffed from the boss's defenses, they were met at the door by Mickey, who chased them off with his cartoony pistol. They tried to run out the door, but were greeted by Goofy and Donald, who were dressed in paramilitary uniforms and armed to the teeth. This descended into cartoon violence, in which Mickey and his friends beat Pete and the workers to a pulp. The children laughed at the scene, while the adults were far more uncomfortable, but didn't dare show it.\nThe film ended with the workers returning to their jobs, while Mickey gave a special medal to the young girl.

Radios, cinemas, phonograms, and even hired speakers all said the same, triumphant words: \"North America has been unified! Long live the North American Technate!\"\nFor a brief second, the continent was silent, taking in the fateful news. Then, all Hell broke loose.\nIn universities and laboratories, people cheered and kissed, ecstatic for their new supremacy over the landmass. In churches and cooperatives, people weeped, knowing their time was at an end. The victorious American soldiers and their native collaborators partied and revelled, while the last resistance cells fell to pits of despair and suicide.\nFor the vast majority of people, however, there was simply a sensation of deep strangeness to the matter. Ever since its settlement by natives thousands of years ago, the continent had been a divided land, only united in its shared animosity towards the European imperialists (and still, Canada often refrained from this hatred). Now, with the continent unified under the unprecedented behemoth of technocracy, nobody quite knew what to make of the matter. It was like witnessing an act of God, suddenly and finally uprooting the entire cosmos. Now, the various races of Yankee and Negro and Quebecois and Mexican now became one: North American. No matter how wrong it felt, the people would have to accept it. The entire thing felt rather Kafkaesque.\nIndeed, amongst the military parade and streams of propaganda, a new race of Americans emerged. This occurred not in the way the Technocrats wanted to, with every person throwing aside their prejudices in favor of glorious Technocracy. Instead, there was a universal feeling, unrestrained by old borders and ethnicities, that reigned over the people. They knew that they now lived under an unstoppable power, which governed for the sake of utilitarian growth, without any regard for faith or morality or beauty. This was felt by all, and gave birth to the new, subjugated North Americans."

 usa.56.desc:0 "It is 1936, and as the United States of America comes down from another morose New Year’s Eve celebration, the new year has brought little to celebrate. One need only take a look around to see why. In the grip of a staggering economic depression since 1929, the sleeping giant of the western hemisphere stirs lethargically. The problems facing the nation, from titanic unemployment and widespread bank failures to the agricultural disaster of the Dust Bowl, have only intensified in the face of continued government inaction. President Andrew Mellon has remained steadfast in his conviction that the \"liquidation\" of much of the economy will produce an overall more competent entrepreneurial spirit. \n\nThis was an optimistic viewpoint in 1932, with enough believers to put him in office over a divided opposition. Then came a catastrophic wave of new bank failures brought about by Artaud and Kolchak repudiating their countries’ debts over two years.  Now it seems outright foolhardy to much of the nation. \"Mellonvilles\" - shantytowns formed by the dispossessed - continue blooming across the country. Local relief efforts to employ people in public works falter due to falling tax revenue, and overstretched charities and soup kitchens have made do with less for too long. Millions roam the USA chasing what work they can find from businesses increasingly paranoid about investing in a chaotic world. It remains to be seen how, if at all, America will escape this crisis. \n\nYet with the presidential election approaching, at least some change appears to be on the horizon, and it will likely be a dramatic one. Opposite the governing Republicans, the aftermath of the collapse of the Democratic Party has opened the field for a number of ideologically distinct candidates. The technocrats continue their experiments in scientifically managed society, not the only ones in America drawing inspiration from the French model. Emboldened workers’ movements such as the Jobless Progressive Party have likewise never been more popular. And in the backrooms and offices of the Republican Party itself, party brass debate stabbing their President in the back to put somebody, anybody else in the driver’s seat to steer them to victory. Will the political establishment salvage its legitimacy? Or will 1936 herald an epochal shift in the American way?"

When the stock market crashed seven years ago, the impacts on common investors and banks took the agricultural sector with it, even before the environment twisted the knife on the farmers still working. And then came the next bank runs in 1934. Luxury commodities went too, then manufacturing in general, and resource extraction with that. And now, even if there was demand, construction can't find any money in city and state budgets dealing with tax shortfalls to build anything. People aren't working, and people aren't buying either.\n\nThe most novel things in these documents are the justifications used to smooth the bad news. Certainly, Andrew Mellon's time as Secretary of the Treasury did preside over a period of renewed prosperity. Why would it be the fault of him or his presidency if people chose to live beyond their means and take out loans to invest in stocks? When the natural downturn in the business cycle came due, it showed the cost of their incompetence. Admittedly, the consequences have been severe, but in a sense, perhaps the American standard of living is returning to where it should be."

So much land is now effectively unfit for farming, and to make matters worse, strong winds whip clouds of topsoil up into horrifying \"black blizzard\" dust storms. The result has been a widespread flight of dispossessed farmers from the heart of the country to the outlying states, especially California, but in the current economic circumstances no safe haven really has the resources to house and take care of these people. Not that they should concern themselves if the glut of labor arriving is too proud to work for what's available.\n\nThe question was posed: after the country-spanning Black Sunday dust storm last year, has the situation improved? With the damage remaining severe in parts of Oklahoma, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, Texas, and New Mexico, the answer is a resounding \"no.\" Managing the impacts on food production and the outflow of population from the region has remained a blight on our economy since.

The picture our various federal intelligence agencies are giving is uncomfortably muddled, leaving much of our information to be sourced from the press. There is a risk that public discontent with our government could boil over into attempted revolt against us and the republic itself, if what we know is correct. \n\nPetty crime, too, has skyrocketed. While some of the more notorious criminals of the period - bank robbers, bootleggers, murderers - have been apprehended by our Bureau of Investigation, there still remain others they’ve had no luck tracking down. The sudden disappearance of quasi-celebrity bank robber John Dillinger after a run-in with BOI agents years ago provided an unsatisfying end to that public odyssey, needless to say.

The fear of British manufacturing and resource extraction competing with already strained American companies proves protectionism is still alive and well. The Jobless Progressive Party was ripe with denunciations on behalf of urban workers, while the American Party was equally vociferous about the  potential impacts on American farmers. The technocrats, after some deliberation, issued a unanimous condemnation on the basis of us allegedly having all America needs to prosper in our own hemisphere. And then, of course, President Mellon's own connections to the Alcoa Corporation, especially given how it would benefit from planned trade with Canada, were scrutinized by the press and in some capacity by every party.\nThe reluctance was echoed by our counterparts in Britain. With the Commonwealth also being protective of its markets and, in some corners, worried about foreign influence chipping away at imperial loyalty, our offers were rapidly rebuffed. Furthermore, as more governments have fallen into extremism in past years, or in the case of India, imploded entirely, the desire to avoid relying too much on foreign trade is going stronger than ever.

The assumption that this organization would be a stopgap until a new president took power ended with the election of an administration even more committed to laissez-faire economic policy. While the NCA has offered many loans through the first half of the decade, often taking the most valuable assets of the smaller banks as collateral, it is an article of faith among many of the larger banks that these aren't an investment worth getting involved in.\nWhen President Mellon's administration approached the NCA to ask them to be more generous with their lending in the wake of the Sunset Crash, the collective response was brief and sharp, being characterized in the press as somewhere between \"with what money?\" and \"why would we sink money into a guaranteed loss?\" Even some of Mellon's loyalists are sounding the alarm - anonymously - about what this means for the future of American financial policy."

The technocrats, after some deliberation, issued a unanimous condemnation on the basis of us allegedly having all America needs to prosper in our own hemisphere. And then, of course, President Mellon's own connections to the Alcoa Corporation, especially given how it would benefit from planned trade with Canada, were scrutinized by the press and in some capacity by every party.\nThe reluctance was echoed by our counterparts in Britain. With the Commonwealth also being protective of its markets and, in some corners, worried about foreign influence chipping away at imperial loyalty, our offers were rapidly rebuffed. Furthermore, as more governments have fallen into extremism in past years, or in the case of India, imploded entirely, the desire to avoid relying too much on foreign trade is going stronger than ever.

The problems facing the nation, from titanic unemployment and widespread bank failures to the agricultural disaster of the \"Dust Bowl,\" have only intensified in the face of continued government inaction. President Andrew Mellon has remained steadfast in his conviction that the \"liquidation\" of much of the economy will produce an overall more competent entrepreneurial spirit. This was an… interesting viewpoint in 1932, with enough believers to put him in office over a divided opposition. Now it seems outright foolhardy to much of the nation. \"Mellonvilles\" - shantytowns formed by the dispossessed - continue blooming across the country. Local relief efforts to employ people in public works falter due to falling tax revenue, and overstretched charities and soup kitchens have made do with less for too long.

Emboldened workers' movements such as the Jobless Progressive Party have likewise never been more popular.

And yet the battle continued. While the rise of the Jobless Progressive Party federally helped funnel funds and support into Harlan County, as well as helping to bridge the gap between the \"labor priests\" and some of the more orthodox socialists, known union membership is still a cause for firing and blacklisting in the mines.

Underfunded like any governmental service during the Mellon years, the federal law enforcement agency under J. Edgar Hoover has had a lot of \"might have beens\" over the years. Well, after a period of silence that at least led to the hope that the ostensible folk hero had quit the business, John Dillinger has resurfaced, this time remarkably far from his haunts near Chicago.

The madman and his professional outfit of gangsters have reemerged in the American south, becoming the talk of the news and parlors nationwide yet again.\nOf course, this is terrible news given the increasing breakdown in federal authority. Whether Dillinger has had a Robin Hood type of aura to people or not, the increasing frustration of federal initiatives has meant, well… the BOI is arguably less equipped today than it was five years ago. This could mean Dillinger is destined to have another run of luck before he can be tracked down again. Bad news for a government trying to enforce some kind of stability in a divided nation.\nTo make matters worse, there's an intellectual current in America - linked to the French Acéphale secret society, no doubt - that extols the virtues of this bank robber. The erstwhile writer William S. Burroughs, on the way back to America after a stint in Europe (especially France), has been positively luminescent, walking on air, writing about him. Bizarrely, rumors are that Dillinger has found Burroughs' writing quite flattering on a personal level.

Perhaps they were conducting more than diplomacy and debauchery in the last year, but it is too late to discuss these connections fruitfully now.In short: the Dillinger Gang has overthrown the government of Louisiana. Greeting excited onlookers and local journalists with a shower of money from recent bank robberies, John Dillinger is trading on his Robin Hood reputation to position himself as a popular folk hero to save the poor and desperate of the region. As the banners bearing the Acéphale symbol roll out and the Consulat général makes approving noises about salvaging parts of America from \"communist degeneracy,\" it is difficult not to read the situation as some sort of coup on the part of Avant-Garde France. To make matters more suspicious, Dillinger has named the American author John S. Burroughs, one of the more vocal champions of his \"cause\" and the French artistic currents, to be the \"Kingfish\" of the newly independent accelerationist state.With a similar coup underway in Arkansas by a supposedly spontaneous mob at the state house chanting for John Dillinger, it seems a radical regime is securing itself in the American South.

So much to even begin to fill this gaping hole in the United States of America. The small-scale resettlements of farmers from the driest lands, the shelterbelt growing initiatives, the educational programs to teach the salt of the earth how to grow sustainably… Hell, even paying farmers for surplus cattle they could no longer afford to take care of and having them turned into food for the poor. The Dust Bowl initiatives have been an unprecedented administrative effort to manage an almost Biblical disaster. And it's all going to be worth less than shit once the government collapses and Technocracy, Inc. is back to trying to fix things off solicited donations and state funding.Benton and his men are more than just dispassionate technocrats managing numbers from an office. MacKaye himself has a deep love of the land - far away from the nature he dwelled in during his childhood, coping with familial tragedy, but still good land nonetheless. It's just too much to imagine all this work being for nothing.But there are sympathetic men in the relief administration. There are also a great number of farmers who are thankful for government relief after years of Mellon. Most importantly, there is a very beleaguered state government in Oklahoma that knows it owes a lot to these federal programs. And so, in another corner of America, the fraying of authority continues."

The contents of this ultimatum have effectively transferred governmental authority to a board of experts headed by MacKaye himself until a \"sufficiently competent and stable\" government prevails in the United States. Practically speaking, Oklahoma has seceded from federal authority.Alas, Oklahoma's future is uncertain. While MacKaye's work is well respected in the states afflicted by the Dust Bowl, there are many other factions in the region vying for power.

The oil boom at the beginning of the century did much to transform the economy of the state, and while the state was dominated by a Democratic Party that disenfranchised the poor and minority populations, that sort of prosperity was worth noting. When agriculture, oil, and other exports took hit after hit from the global economic calamity and environmental disaster to the north, the bad times returned. Texas has been restive since the crash hit - while it can sometimes be attributed to how the state Democrats had blocked other major parties from making footholds, socialist electoral power in Texas did make its presence felt in the 1936 election, and labor unrest has been exacerbated with the tide of Dust Bowl migrants.That being said, the election of the Jobless Progressive Party has been hopeful for some. Promises of Dust Bowl relief are overdue for many in the state, and all sorts of workers in depressed industries can find something to smile about with the coming of the Cox presidency. The joy is not universally felt, of course. The upper echelons of Texaco, Shell, and other American oil companies would clearly resent any new taxes being levied on their work - or, god forbid, some kind of nationalization scheme. Scaremongering about what the new regime means for race relations has also made things a little sensitive down south. Perhaps the JPP has some work to do to earn people's trust."

The circumstances of Texan independence have been messier than expected, however - with attempts by civilian authorities to declare independence or contain the materializing Mexican invasion falling into infighting, Air Force Captain Otto P. Weyland has emerged at the front of a military government. Weyland has thus far indicated that the army would take on extraordinary powers to protect Texas.\n\nWhether this is a prelude to civilian government or just the creation of a new military clique is hard to say. Business interests, those concerned with the border, and opponents of the new federal government have been tentatively optimistic with the new government, but will this continue if elections are not held? It is unclear if Texas will throw in its lot with the Emergency Committee for the Re-Establishment of the United States or attempt to forge a new path, independent once more.

He is evidently careful these days not to voice political opinions in uniform, especially after brushes with discipline for gossiping with the press about Antonin Artaud, but some inquiries have revealed sympathies with the JPP and a history of remarks about \"foreign adventurism on behalf of big business.\" Major General Butler has thus been approached to give the government a reading of the situation.\nThe preliminary report has been alarming. A wide swathe of officers are cool, if not hostile, toward the regime. While a good number of rank and file soldiers have radical beliefs, many are more concerned with protecting their homes and communities around where they are stationed rather than marching to Washington to defend the revolution. It appears the continued breakdown of federal administration has been noted in the military, and while Butler can not confirm anything yet, he has reason to believe some officers are meeting with other civilian authorities off the record. Needless to say, this confirms some of the government's worst fears.\nButler will soon be heading west of the Mississippi to follow up his reporting on the matter.

While he has not been especially forthcoming with his reasoning, it can be assumed that the new military regime in the region has similar motivations as NeMeCo to its south - the protection of Americans in the occupied states. There has not been a similar panic about invasion from the north, but Butler's loyal military forces have been welcome manpower for tamping down social instability in the area - instability potentially made worse by the secession of the Dakotas cutting it off from the federal government.What this means for the battle royale in America, no one can truly say. Butler has yet to declare his allegiance to the Emergency Committee like so many other military-led factions, and his clique's future direction is thus unknown. The diplomatic isolation of this new contender is only made less troubling by its physical isolation.

Fritz Kuhn savaged the inept federal response to the ongoing crisis, as well as them \"selling out America to radicals of inferior stock.\" German or not, a number of attendees found themselves in agreement with the lambasting of the JPP, though the street fighting between Bund militants and protestors at the event was also noted by the press. One thing is for sure: what seemed destined to live and die as some ideological also-ran on the American left has developed surprising momentum."

Fritz Kuhn, riding into the states of Kansas and Nebraska in support of Volksbund militants, has declared the 미 \"인민국\". The party banners wave triumphantly as the first Bundist administration begins to take shape in the center of the USA, a new radical nationalist and socialist regime that has come to ostensibly rescue its countrymen from anarchist misrule.\n\nWhile the new Volksstaat has stopped just short of declaring war on the federal government, it is clear that the Bund is calling the shots in the heart of America. Administration of the two states is in the hands of this hardline communist faction, whatever that entails, and whether Kuhn will be a temporary ally of the government in blocking the American military government or a threat to their western flank is likewise unclear. After all, the Bund's headquarters before the secessions was in New York City, and they may have militants in the east of the country to call upon for support. The ambitions of this radical Goebbelsite movement are surely great, and they're stepping into a shattered union to achieve them."

While Flynn's partisans are not alone, being backed up (for now) by an assortment of anti-establishment leftist parties, opposition has become increasingly militant. Already, militias and state governors are trumpeting the necessity of resisting the new regime, whether through force of arms or, of all things, secession.\nThe remains of the Jobless Progressive Party are not unaware of this, however. Liberating the United States from oppression was always bound to meet resistance from those who were not prepared to accept it. Men and women on the ground have forwarded reports of impending plots against the new union, from talk of bourgeois collusion to \"save the republic\" to, most imminent, the planned secession of the state of Vermont. Some are mulling over deploying the National Guard to preempt these threats.\nBut there are problems with this approach. While a fair share of soldiers have sympathies with the revolutionaries, we cannot guarantee this would be well received. Such a drastic response might also provoke our enemies to take action while the revolution is still vulnerable. After all, we still have not finished seizing control of all the levers of power from reactionary forces. Alas, the final decision rests with Flynn."

Reactionary armed forces, in cooperation with titans of industry, have made their play to destroy the next American revolution. A triumphalist march through Washington DC today ended with the installation of a new caretaker government led by [placeholder] to reestablish control over the United States of America before it can be irrevocably broken. Allegedly, a nascent Council of Corporations is already working to coordinate the economic and administrative recovery of the country, without constitutional limits or capitulation to bomb-throwing anarchists to stymie their vision.\nThe revolution birthed by the 1936 election and the assassination of President Cox is being strangled in its cradle.

Come on, come all, from whatever background, faith, creed or person you may be, to the American Republic of Labor!"

 USA_union_dominance_desc:0 "It's still a long way to getting to the country we’ve always dreamed off. Instead of expecting true socialism now, we should instead focus on improving the livelihoods of all Americans in more simple ways. That way, we can directly improve our popularity and ensure that future generations can use these tools to build towards the grand Commonwealth of Toil!"
 USA_empower_the_farming_unions:0 "Empower the Farming Unions"
 USA_empower_the_farming_unions_desc:0 "Farmers, especially immigrant farmers, are under-represented, underpaid and over exploited. This needs to end, and what better way to do that than give farming unions more power over bargaining. The land barons who exploit these honest people shall scream in terror as they realize the whips and chains they had no longer exist!"
 USA_slum_improvements:0 "Slum Improvements"
 USA_slum_improvements_desc:0 "Those who aren’t homeless but still broke often live in slums, which are poorly built, not well maintained and even racially segregated. This cannot go on any further. We shall instead invest in new low income housing with better designed structures, safer locations and no racial discrimination. Every person has the right to live safely, and this is one of the ways we ensure that."
 USA_use_coxs_legacy:0 "Use Cox's Legacy"
 USA_use_coxs_legacy_desc:0 "James Cox was a kind and earnest man who wanted nothing less than a better America. He was a bit short sighted in his vision on how to get their, but one cannot deny his courage and ability. His legacy is ours, and we shall represent his ideas and cause wherever there is political and economic tyranny. He may be dead, but his soul marches on."

 USA_soil_conservation_desc:0 "The Dust Bowl helped dry up a lot of land and caused severe droughts and famines amongst the population. We need to ensure that what land hasn’t been dried up is protected and well managed, and that can’t be done by businesses. That can only be done by the people and their government managing it together. That way, everyone can get good food from a safe source."

 USA_aid_the_dust_migrants_desc:0 "The migration crisis caused by the Dust Bowl needs to end as soon as possible. They need shelter, food, medical equipment and work, and quickly. This is an emergency, and we shall do whatever we can to remedy the situation as possible."
 USA_community_help_schemes:0 "Community Help Schemes"
 USA_community_help_schemes_desc:0 "In order to build a greater sense of community amongst the American people, we should begin to promote help schemes. These are ways to ensure that people can turn to their neighbor to help with something, rather than just assuming they can do it themselves. That way, stronger bonds can be made within communities to ensure that they don’t need bourgeois, or even government, assistance when they need something done."
 USA_housing_building_projects:0 "Housing Building Projects"
 USA_housing_building_projects_desc:0 "The success of the slum improvements programs have proven to many that public housing is a solid method of dealing with homelessness. We shall begin building even more houses, designed to be simple, comfortable and cost effective. Every American should be able to be proud of their home, and never again have to worry about sleeping on the cold streets."

 USA_executive_order_for_federal_funding_desc:0 "In order to get the economy back on track, we need money to invest in the economy and to better the people. That means an executive order to get it, so that we can invest as quickly as possible and get back on track financially. The capitalists will sneer, but they got us into this mess in the first place; now their money will have to fix it!"
 USA_level_the_playing_field:0 "놀이터 평탄화"
 USA_level_the_playing_field_desc:0 "The bosses have no right to order around people while contributing nothing. Under the new management system, unions will get the same representation as bosses at the decision table in every business. Workers shall be able to voice their concerns and the bosses will have to learn to work with them in turn, rather than shout them down."

 USA_the_right_to_a_job_desc:0 "Everyone has a right to work. Regardless of who they are, no one should be left unemployed and broke because of the greed of a plutocrat. The government shall make the right to work federal law, and guarantee employment for everyone, be they citizen or migrant, white or black, man or woman."
 USA_healthcare_for_all:0 "모두를 위한 의료제도"
 USA_healthcare_for_all_desc:0 "As we have said before, the ability to live safely and freely is a right, and not a privilege. Our government should lead the world in providing healthcare for every single one of our citizens, and ensure that they don’t have to worry about expensive health costs. Only then, can we call this country free; because that is the ability to be free from fear."
