 MLI_a_mans_vision_desc:0 "In the face of the chaos brought upon West Africa in 1934, Hama sought answers for what the future of his land could be. The French departure was not the end of suffering for Africa, as Liberians open the gates for American exploitation, while Britain and Italy still choke so many Africans under their rule. Against all of these, Hama has found a homebrewn remedy: the native, original spirit of Africa will endure against the invaders and drive them back to where they came from, and then its true people will forge a path of their own choosing in harmony with their traditions and culture."
 MLI_DESC_MENU:0 "The colonial government in Bamako was another authority to resist Le Soleil's demands, but it could not withstand the native agitation for independence. The broad coalition, aligned with the revolutionaries in Dakar and Ouagadougou, attempted to form its own Soudanaise republic, but the attempt would not last long. Exiled from their homeland, Boubou Hama's Nigerien remnant fought their way upwards the Niger, overthrowing the fragile administration. Since then, Hama's movement has been locked into an existential war against they sought refuge into, while planning their return home to Niamey. Surrounded by hostile forces, the teacher-turned-leader must take the right choices to ensure his people's future."

 POLITICS_MLI_boubou_hama:0 "A prophet to his men, but an occupier to the land he rules. Boubou Hama, like so many other men of his generation, became both a teacher and a political leader for his people. Unlike them, he did not turn to European futurism for answers to Africa's woes. Close to the community he was born into, Hama never doubted his allegiances. His youth would not translate into supporting the radical modernism that men his age embraced, from Senegal to native Niger. In an unexpected act of what was seen as defiance by the RDA, Hama and his men would establish their own movement in Niamey.\n\nIt was in those days that Boubou Hama began searching for a moderate, cautionary path for Niger, for Sahel and for Africa. Ethnic diversity, the richness of African folklore and its fundamentally humane vision of a future free from the soulless mechanization that was consuming the Europeans. It may have come as a vindication that in 1934, France turned against each other. In this moment, the peoples of its empire were finally set free. For the young Nigeriens, it was a time of hope. It would not last for long.\n\nWhile militants aligned with the Nazi Boni's nascent government tried seizing Niamey, Tuareg clans led by veteran fighter Kaocen ag Geda swept into Agadez and further beyond. The hastily assembled Nigerien military moved upwards the Niger river, holding their opponents at bay while seeking to establish a temporary stronghold. It was fate that pushed them up to Bamako, where the beleaguered Soudanaise government was in the same position Hama found himself at home. Already facing threats from bandits and Islamists, the hardened armies of Boubou Hama and his rump Republic of Niger marched into the local RDA's capital of Bamako, finally entrenching itself.\n\nSince then, the exiles held out against the RDA, the Islamist Ansar Dine movement and the bands roaming the land. In order to survive, harsh measures had to be taken against the hostile locals. Neither Boubou Hama, the Nigeriens or the Maliens desire this state of affairs, but until they return home, they will have to make do. In these desperate times, the only thing keeping Hama afloat seems to be a fading sense of hope."

 MLI_exiles_dynmod_desc:0 "The Songhai, prominent in Niger and in eastern French Sudan, have been the heirs of a great empire in the Sahel, and yet..! Their largest land dominated by them now is barely considered Songhai by any standards. The few Songhai that aren't in the Niger river are mostly refugees from Niamey who now exist in exile in Soudan looking for ways to save the Sahel once more, akin to their ancient ancestors. But for now, Soudan's authority has no popular support in terms of ethnic issues."
 MLI_right_dynmod_desc:0 "If we pillage our fellow Africans, what makes us any different from the French colonizers? Where the Europeans trampled upon, we will build and grow. We have our own home, far away from us for now, but Soudan is the home of its own people too. We are not of this place, and we must pay back for our stay. This is what is right to do."
 MLI_RDA_underground:0 "The Democratic Underground"
 MLI_RDA_underground_desc:0 "In the first days of Soudanaise freedom in 1934, a republic was proclaimed in Bamako by the local branch of the RDA. Compared to its sister in Upper Volta, it was not able to properly assert its authority beyond the confines of its capital, thus falling to Hama's army of exiles when it arrived, seeking shelter for itself. This proved to be a blessing in disguise for its activists, as brutal military rule allowed the RDA to become the one and only front for the freedom and liberties of the Soudanaise people."
