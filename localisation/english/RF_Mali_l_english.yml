 POLITICS_BOUBOU_HAMA_DESC:0 "Children of escaped slaves, Boubou Hama has felt his ancestors' pains from birth. Working as a teacher by trade in Niamey, trained by the top class educators of French Africa over at the urban centre of Dakar, and then moving back to Niamey, by 1933 he realized France was barely able to hold her colonies, and subsequently began political studies behind doors to \"improve his curriculum\". Truth is, he was looking for ways to work within the system and bring autonomy, or perhaps even independence to his homeland. Turns out, fate was not looking at him well that year. As the French authority collapsed a year later within the Sahel and West African colonies, Boubou Hama was forced to take the reins of power by local native militias, which saw him as their educator and protector, even if slightly treasonous for working with the French (then again, what could be done at the time was severely limited). In this new position, his government in Niamey was desperate, disorganized, and poorly protected from Tuareg bandits, who by 1935 had sieged out Niamey and declared a Jihad against the secular Hama government. Desperate, destitute and left with no other choice, Boubou Hama's provisional Nigerien Army and his government fled upwards in the Niger river, escaping attacks by UDM militias in the borderlands as the Voltaic forces pacified the countryside. Now finding himself in the banks of the Niger in Mali, Hama and his comrades declared the Republic of Mali, which was previously held by a confusing mix of colonial remnants, democratic intellectuals and many other factions. This Republic had the exact same government as the one in Niamey, without being elected. With this, the Voltaic intervention in Mali began, as Bamako became sieged out, it seemed that Hama was destined to be a fleeing dog, dying in the sands of time. Yet, Providence fought against Fate and brought him great victories, driving the Voltaic forces back to the Niger river, protecting the small Nigerien Army and the Hama Government, all of which were given a great propaganda victory - yet one without meaning. The peoples of Mali, now at only 5% Songhai, as the rest was now under Voltaic jurisdiction, despise Hama's unelected Government. And yet, Boubou Hama stands, exhausted and depressed - yet strong in his resolve to go back to his homeland."
 POLITICS_HAMA_DED_DESC:0 "As Hama's dream of getting to Niger failed, having gambled far too much in the fight against Upper Volta - Hama was found dead in his office as his soldiers retreated into the border with Upper Volta; in a constant state of warfare, it has become clear that Mali has been thrown into a state of permanent warlordism and chaos, with minor bandits taking over territory and Hama's loyalists trying to restore order."

 MLI_minuscule_ruling_minority_desc:0 "The Songhai, prominent in Niger and in eastern French Sudan, have been the heirs of a great empire in the Sahel, and yet..! Their largest land dominated by them now is barely considered Songhai by any standards. The few Songhai that aren't in the Niger river are mostly refugees from Niamey who now exist in exile in Mali looking for ways to save the Sahel once more, akin to their ancient ancestors. But for now, Mali's authority has no popular support in terms of ethnic issues."
 MLI_a_mans_vision:0 "단 한 사람의 전망"
 MLI_a_mans_vision_desc:0 "The Republic of Mali is an artificial institution with no legitimacy. That is the view of almost every single citizen within it's borders, and yet it stands - not repressing its own people or trying to colonize their lands, but merely desperate soldiers trying to get by - and Hama's vision to come back home has enticed them to keep going, even if it all hurts so much."

 mali.999.desc:0 "Bamako's evening sun fell down as the Parliament of The Republic of Mali was under siege - again. People across Mali were shooting each other, with the rugged and ruddy veterans of Niger, some of them the greatest warriors that Hama had seen, defending the building desperately. An ad-hoc creation, the Bamako parliament was a bit of an architectural nightmare. Made from the largest court Hama's government could find, it's been the home of the politicians that have sided with Hama ever since the 1934 expulsion. Bullets rang out and blood vessels sobbed across the floor, while politicians found themselves taking up weapons to defend what little they had left.\nHama himself was in his office, writing down everything he could think of - from the color of the flowers of his office, to how long he cried in perfect chronometration. He annotated and meticulously wrote down every last inch of information he could get, every last bit of things to note. Hama, a teacher for most of his life, knew that he couldn't help but document everything that was going on purely because he knew how ephemeral it all was. As things slipped away from his hurting spirit, Hama heard the screams of dying soldiers and civilians.\nThe final promise that he had made, had failed - the last thing he could have promised had failed. Everything went wrong - everything was ruined. He laid his head in front of the high quality wooden table he had, the smoothened and polished Zebrano which looked at him intently. He felt every inch of his soul weep as soldiers of his command died. Perhaps, however, it could be believed that with the death of his dreams, a better future could arise from its corpse?\nHama pondered quietly as his sobbing continued. Perhaps it was best to leave the world to its motions."

 mali.1000.desc:0 "Hearing no word from their commander, the Republic of Niger's Armed Forces continued to fight on, maintaining his orders and continuing to enforce the frontline. Despite troubles in Bamako itself, the border guards had maintained good order and it seemed a pincer movement could be done.\n\nAbdoulaye Soumaré quickly got to work organizing the little forces left and regrouping them along the Niger river. As he and his men travelled onwards in the river, an officer whom Abdoulaye couldn't remember the name of protested, talking somewhat calmly but otherwise firmly:\n\n\"Sir, why are we abandoning Hama?\"\n\nAbdoulaye had no clue why. He thought about the potential reasons, and all of them pointed to nothing in particular. They trailed off in his head like sugar in water, and his mind trailed off.\n\n\"Er... We needed to do a tactical retreat - unfortunately Hama couldn't come with us.\"\nHe knew he wasn't convincing anyone, but luckily the officer didn't ask anything further.Abdoulaye's forces eventually reached an outpost in Makadjié, where they caught fish and began to prepare themselves for an offensive at the disorganized partisans and rebels near Kolongo, further down the Niger river.\nAbdoulaye's forces eventually reached an outpost in Makadjié, where they caught fish and began to prepare themselves for an offensive at the disorganized partisans and rebels near Kolongo, further down the Niger river.\nOffensive after offensive, the borders kept becoming evermore porous, and a humanitarian crisis came abound as Upper Volta and other nearby countries are forced to take in refugees.\n\nIt seems that nothing is coming together, now."

The beautiful building surrounding me, the clear skies and the sunny day interrupted by the destructive playfulness of cracking bullets, as they make men bleed and have their sobbing veins pour downards into the eternal soil.\n\nAll I ask of my final moments is agency, and subsequently the need to take my own life in my own terms, seeing a map of my great Niger and my people in my head and heart. I walk towards the Beyond with no fear, I walk forward to the skies without a single regret.\n\nI have considered myself a teacher all my life. My young heart still believes in the education of a people to be their eternal prize. Yet, despite all my claims of youth - my body feels evermore hurt, weak, and unable to do more. I feel like I could have done more - I could have done better. And yet, I did everything I could.\n\nPerhaps my body will grow many flowers one day.\""
