 UNITED_KINGDOM_DESC:0 "대전쟁의 승전국인 영국은 수많은 젊은이의 목숨을 대가로 승전할 수 있었습니다. 하지만 승전의 기쁨을 누릴 틈도 없이 영국을 곪아오던 문제는 더욱 커져만 갔고, 대영제국은 서서히 붕괴의 길을 걷기 시작했습니다. 바로 대전쟁 후기에 아일랜드가 무너지고, 이를 이어서 대영제국 제관의 보석이던 인도가 혁명과 민족주의에 무너진 것입니다. 연이은 정치적 위기와 국왕의 갑작스러운 승하로 대영제국과 자치령들은 흔들렸으나, 영국은 희망을 잃지 않았습니다. 해가 지지 않는 나라의 해는 아직 지지 않았고, 지지 않을 것입니다."
 politics_edward_viii_desc:0 "에드워드 8세는 1927년 11월에 패혈증으로 승하한 부황 조지 5세를 이어 대영제국의 국왕 겸 황제로 즉위했습니다. 에드워드의 통솔하에 영국은 1920년대 초반의 불안정한 상황을 타개하고 미래를 향한 새로운 길을 개척해 나갔습니다. 하지만 이 모든 것은 대공황에 의해 좌절되었고, 결국 이는 제국의 쇠퇴로 이어졌습니다. 엎친 데 덮친 격으로 에드워드 8세가 여러 추문을 빚어내고 급진파들을 향한 정치적 동조를 보내자, 그는 궁극적으로 영국 정부의 골칫거리가 되었습니다. 이에 정부는 에드워드의 전 정부였던 텔마 퍼니스와의 결혼으로 자신을 스스로 다스릴 수 있기를 바랐지만, 에드워드는 자신의 오랜 방식을 이어 나갔습니다. 에드워드 8세의 치세는 정부가 국왕의 독단적인 행동을 얼마나 용인하고, 또 그가 정부를 얼마나 밀어붙이는가에 달려있습니다."

 ENG_blockade_preparations:0 "봉쇄 대비"
 ENG_blockade_preparations_desc:0 "We must be prepared to be blockaded, in the worst case scenario, or to blockade others. Starving out a nation is a slow, painful, process best achieved with a navy, and without proper planning, it will inevitably fail."

 ENG_sub_warfare_desc:0 "U-boats, or submarines, were devestating in the Great War. Expanding our use of them will be vital if we wish to keep up in the ongoing naval race.

 ENG_listen_air_arm:0 "Listen to the Air Arm"
 ENG_listen_air_arm_desc:0 "The Air Arm has...unorthodox ideas. Entire vessels, stripped of offensive capabilities, and instead filled with planes.

 ENG_new_designs:0 "새 도안"
 ENG_new_designs_desc:0 "New designs of battleships are vital, the dreadnoughts are outdated, and the technology is far better. If we wish to make a capital vessel, it must be with the newest of technology, the best of armor, the heaviest of guns."

 ENG_naval_bombers:0 "해군폭격기"
 ENG_naval_bombers_desc:0 "Bombers, entirely based from and meant to attack naval targets, are lighter, and don't carry as much  as our land-orientated bombers. But one must admit, seeing a 250kg bomb drop with near pinpoint accuracy is something terrifying, and one can only imagine what it could do if it hit a proper ship."

 ENG_royal_paratrooper_core_desc:0 "Men jumping from planes has happened, of course. Mostly in accidents, and often without paracutes. But now, paracuting men can jump safely, land, and act as light infantry. They won't be well supported, but the shock value of enemies landing behind the defensive line will be quite useful."
 ENG_air_defence:0 "대공방위"
 ENG_air_defence_desc:0 "Anti-air cannons, spotlights, whatever we need to defend England against the air raids. Zepplins were easy to target and shoot down, but the potential of these new bombers rightfully strikes fear into the hearts of the command."

 ENG_first_line_of_defence:0 "방어 제1선"
 ENG_first_line_of_defence-desc:0 "The first line of defense against fighters are, well, fighters. Whenver the planes fight, they engage in dogfights, distracting fighters that might attack our ground forces, and buying us valuable time. Anti-air ground troops are immensely useful, but should not be relied on when fighters can do the job even better."
 ENG_air_support_training:0 "공중지원 훈련"
 ENG_air_support_training_desc:0 "Coordindation between the ground and the sky, so planes may support infantry and infantry may support planes, is vital. Radio, signal flares, smoke grenades, whatever we may use to communicate is more than welcome.

Prime Minister Herbert Asquith led the United Kingdom to victory thanks to his son while being gravely injured, survived and gave him the strength to fight of David Lloyd George challenge.\n\n While ultimately victorious, defeat on the Western Front and major losses at the Somme and the Dardanelles campaign caused Britain to retreat into an isolationist attitude as revolutions and fear gripped the world. The twenties for Britain would be the opposite of the great war, a time of peace and relative prosperity, the victory of the Labour Party in the 1926 election over the recently elected conservative government of 1922 caused a small welfare state to form and lives for the common man improved. Led by Arthur Henderson, Britain continued unchanged while the world shifted around it.\n\n This time of peace and prosperity would be stopped in 1931, where Arthur Henderson was assassinated by a French facist and riots consumed Britain. The Labour party unable to deal with the issues lost in the 1931 election to the Conservative party led by Austen Chamberlain who quickly formed a national unity government to tackle the problem. With problems on the mainland, issues in the colonies expanded and grew out of control, culminating in the Indian revolt of 1934 and fall of the British Raj. The National Unity Government would be unable to deal with these problems and in 1934 when the british stock markets crumbled due to the revolt, it took down the world economy with it.\n\n With the government entering 1936, Austen Chamberlain has called a snap election to end the parliamentary deadlock, will Britain recover and resume its place on the world stage, or will the British Lion finally be driven to extinction.

 eng.8.d:0 "The Great War helped to shatter all previous conceptions of military strategy in just a few years. The technological terror of machine guns, gas and mass artillery created a bloodbath the world had never witnessed before, and sadly, we walked right into it without a clue as to what to do. Now, years after the war, we are still trying to learn from it all. \n\nThree main proposals now stand. The first, from general J. F. C. Fuller, argues that the army should adopt a strategy based around speed and mobility, and he had been an adamant proponent of armored warfare and mechanized infantry. His ties to Pro-French futurist groups, however, has made many weary. The second comes from B. H. Liddel Hart, who has said that the Great War has taught us that the future of warfare will be mostly defensive, and that the army should focus on refining tactics for defending the empire and working on how to actually plan well when attack come. This argument, while popular amongst some, has been criticised for its total rejection of maneuver or the ability for technology to change the way a battle is fought. Finally, Alan Brooke has argued that the army should focus on overwhelming firepower in order to completely shatter and destroy the enemy forces. His theories are popular amongst artillerymen, but the proposers of Fuller's plan believe that victory can be achieved without total destruction.\n\nWhatever one picks, it is important to remember that the lives of every single soldier in the army, and the lives of those on the home front, lays in the hands of the generals. The Somme was not just a strategic failure, but a moral one, and those who choose doctrine better have a damn good reason as to why they picked what they did."

In other words, people learn better when it is made into a game. The same goes with military affairs, and there is no better time to see this in action than the Commonwealth War Games. All of the empire's best officers and a good portion of their men are invited to participate in simulations of actual combat, in order to refine their skills and learn how to adapt. After all, it's better to learn in the safety of the exercises than in the middle of combat.\n\nLast year, the officers participated in a theoretical stand-off with the Germans, played by volunteers with terrible impressions of the German accent. This year, they fought the French, who had even worse accents (how they get worse every year we will never know). The simulation was a theoretical defense of Calais, wherein the British had to hold off against waves of French attacks until reinforcements arrived. The French fought with a mixture of mass wave assaults with infantry and quick maneuvers with the armored corps. The British officers did quite well, but they were eventually overwhelmed and defeated. The loss didn't matter too much; for one thing, our officers now have a much better idea as to what is expected of them in live combat. Individual failings were few and far between; most of the issues came down to general coordination and the stress of combat.\n\nWhen it comes to the French devils, one can never be too prepared.

They had 847,000 rifles, 47,000 shotguns and 49,000 machine guns of various kinds. All of this sounds good, until you realise that this meant that 739,000 men had no weapons whatsoever. The Prime Minister, outraged by this, wrote to the Home Office and said that \"every man must have a weapon of some sort, be it only a mace or a pike\". The Home Office clearly didn't understand the joke, because they ordered from the Ministry of Aircraft Production over 250,000 pikes, made out long steel tubes with old bayonets jammed at the ends.\n\nMany are quick to laugh at this, but in a way, there is some hope to be found in this.

Archibald Maule Ramsay, a Scottish MP turned far-right anti-semite, has been a leading figure in Britain's accelerationist movement. Along with the tomboyish monarchist Rotha Lintorn-Orman and the radical propagandist William Joyce, they had made up what liberal and socialist newspapers called the \"Devil's Triumvirate\"; the product of French accelerationism combined with British patriotism and a hatred of Jews and other people deemed foreign to the fatherland they would kill for. So when this group proposed a march through the historically Jewish neighborhood of Cable Street, people were naturally suspicious. Letting them around Jews would be like letting the Japanese generals take a stroll through Chinatown; it's not a matter of \"if\" a fight breaks out, but a matter of \"when\". So the people of Cable Street protested; they didn't want this kind of violence to come to their homes, and they'd happily fight them if they tried anything. This leaves the Triumvirate in a bit of an odd position. They don't want to incur the wrath of the government and the people; Ramsay's experience as an MP has told him that anti-democratic movements still need the people to support. But they also don't want to look weak; how embarrassing would it be for the movement calling Jews inferior to be repelled by their complaining? Finally, after much discussion.

So Ramsay wrote an open letter to the people of Cable Street, criticizing their intolerance to his ideas and warned them that \"this kind of authoritarianism would make Britain look like Germany in just a few short years\". And the people of Cable Street chuckled a bit, shrugged their shoulders and went back to their work. But the Devil's Triumvirate was far from done. Rather than march there, they instead turned their attention to Liverpool, where the reception was far less hostile. The march would be led by Rotha Lintorn-Orman, would would give a speech on the counterproductive nature of parliament and affirm the power of the king. Everything went well for them; resistance was minor, and the bobbies and blackshirts kept any hostile protestors at bay. Rotha's speech was good, but some are concerned for her.

His statements and plans have made many worried that the National Unity government might fracture, and people within the party are talking about a possible replacement of him with Nancy Mitford, a moderate MP and a charismatic politician in her own right. Morrison is now facing calls to resign and allow Mitford to take his place. He could do it, and presumably allow the Unity Government to go on as it did before. But he is unsure whether that is what would happen; after all, the bickering won't stop with Mitford. Maybe he could hold on, and ensure that Britain has a more streamlined economic system? "

Still, this could end with his government dissolving, and that can't happen; so the cabinet has been convened on the question of how to deal with this. Two proposals currently stand. The first, from Leopold Amery, has argued that the strike will burn out, and that the government should just bite its tongue and suffer through it. Amery doesn't like the strike; he thinks its a plot by German communists to disrupt the armed forces. But he thinks that they don't have much of a choice. The second proposal, from John Anderson, is to violently crush the mutiny. He claims that the security of the nation and the empire is at risk, and that they need to crush it or else face the collapse of the British Navy.Sykes is sympathetic to both men, but only one option can be taken.

Thankfully, no one was killed, but a few were injured, and have been brought to hospital immediately. The fire on the ship was also quickly put out thanks to some sensible military police officers working with the sailors to put it out. The Hood is damaged, but it will be repaired in no time.

The Left Book Club is a publishing house aiming at the spreading of left-wing books amongst the people. Its founders, composed of Stafford Cripps, Victor Gollancz and John Strachey, wanted to help revitalise the socialist movement in Britain, and its mission statement is to \"help in the struggle for world peace and against accelerationism\". Criticizing what they have argued is an intellectualist and anti-worker trend amongst the left, they aim to distribute popular, readable and well-argued literature amongst the working people of Britain. They aim to help peacefully dismantle the empire, focus more on diplomacy and invest in social programs to help the poor.

Instead, he spent his time with his countless mistresses, to the dismay of the more conservative minded of the royal family and parliament. Most notably amongst them was Thelma Furness, a socialite and close companion of Edward.\n\n But the childish antics and fast living would come to an end when Edward met Pamela Mitford. The young king found here more charming and attractive than his many mistresses, and after much talk and discussion, it was decided that they would be married. This was met with the conservatives collectively thank the heavens for the boy to finally have some sense, and the royal family was happy to see the mistress's gone.\n\nIt was also an interesting choice of partner; the Mitford sisters were well known for their political involvement, with Nancy being an MP for Labour, Jessica being a fellow traveller to the Communists, and Diana being a high-ranking figure in the far-right Nordic League. Pamela was the least politically involved out of all of them, which was another factor that made the royal family appreciate his choice.\n\nThe wedding will be held during June this year, and is expected to be attended by thousands of people and many important political figures."

Diana even left a note in it saying that \"a leader needs to know how to fight, as all politics is violence harnessed by the state\". Nancy sent some wine and a Labour Party songbook, and Unity had a record of Richard Wagner's greatest works sent. The sisters were not merely interested in just congratulating their sister; they saw the fate of Britain in their hands.\n\nThe wedding has repaired Edward's reputation amongst many of his skeptics (or at least kept them silent), and his duties as a husband will hopefully help him settle down for now.

Needless to say, this rumour has been kept under wraps; homosexuality is a crime under the law, and the reputation hit the royal family could take would be nasty.\n\nBut Edward and Pamela are quite happy; they both needed each other as friends and as solutions to problems, and once that was done, they have pursued new partners.

 eng.44.d:0 "Controversial Chinese Emperor-turned-Movie Director, Henry Aisin Gioro, has recently released a slapstick comedy about a simple court eunuch. This flick, hilariously comedic and sickeningly violent, has the titular, childishly malicious Wu causing deep emotional torment to those around him much to the enjoyment of the painfully naïve emperor. One particularly brutal moment was the castrated elderly baking and serving a cake filled with broken glass and needles to other eunuchs of the court. Critics have dismissed the work as stupid nonsense and frankly disgusting, however those most loyal to the director have claimed the movie has far more to it that first thought and claim that the movie is an apology from the artist formerly known as Puyi directed to his own eunuchs."

 eng.45.d:0 "Henry Aisin Gioro has created a new dramatic movie based on a gritty depiction of Britain's local Chinatowns. The plot of the movie starts with a white Londoner coming to Chinatown to look for \"entertainment\" as he goes through the various streets of the lightened neighborhood, slowly walking around with dramatic music playing in the background as he finds a Shanghainese-origin prostitute, who subsequently courts the white man to her apartment, a moldy and dirty place - and, in the height of the sexual tension, the man begins strangling the woman and slowly kills her, with immense struggle and violence, resulting in a bloody enviroment. This movie has been interpreted as the view of the Western World of not only Chinese people in Europe, but of China as a nation, with the woman representing China and the white man representing Europe. Many have asked Henry why was the woman killed, and he replies \"You don't care when it happens in real life, why do you care when it happens in the movie?\"."

 eng.46.d:0 "Henry Aisin Gioro's latest movie, Mime, has critics divided. There are those that claim this violent, and dramatised account of the life of the French Patron Artaud will inspire violence among disenfranchised young men and call for the Board of Censors to ban this movie. But then there is the other wing of critics who have already called this deeply psycholgical look at what happens when you cross the downtrodden and mentally disturbed with a deeply unjust society as Henry's magnum opus - \"a gut wrenching, character driven kino, an exquisite choice\" as one critic described it. It is without a doubt the most impressive movie of his career. Drawing on his experiences writing Echoes of Chengdu and Red Lights of Chinatown - Henry has seemingly pulled off the impossible: merging Shakespearean tragedy and Chaplinesque humour into what can only be described as the darkest of comedies."

 eng.47.d:0 "Henry Aisin Gioro's newest movie is... difficult to categorise - it begins suddenly with a man screaming while he bleeds out from a bullet wound, only to slowly die in pain through a grueling 5 minutes of audio and video which many believed were real sounds of death. After this, flowers appear on the screen where the blood used to be, and colours spring up from an increasingly darkening background where former sounds of shooting and high-caliber weapons could be heard. As more sounds come, more flowers appear, some with different colours - all mixed in with the sounds of pain, horror, and violence. The movie eventually ends with the sounds of common German imperial songs such as \"Schwarzbraun ist die Haselnuss\" and British imperial songs, then shows many bloodied flags flying in the wind. Many believe the film is an enactment of the Boxer Rebellion, but they aren't too sure."

 eng.49.d:0 "The soldiers of Britannia bled at Gallipoli, and at the end of the Great War, we oversaw the creation of the Straits Commission to ensure their sacrifice would not be in vain, and to ensure free navigation to the Black Sea. While things have worked well so far, the vile Turks greedily eye the city of Constantine - and a not-insignificant number of the residents of the Commission might wish to rejoin the state of their yokel kinsmen in Central Anatolia.\nAbsent a clear threat, the public may not be especially keen to deploy British troops to what is technically not an Imperial possession. But we would be foolish not to take steps against Turkish irredentism, especially with Russia, the other guarantor of the Commission, expressing serious signs of weakness since last November.\n Luckily, our Greek allies view the territorial integrity of the Commission - and the protection of Constantinople - as a leading p iority for their nation, and have no qualms about fighting the Turks. We need only ensure they have the means.\nAs they are rather seriously outnumbered, we should take pains to ensure they very excellent means available indeed. By selectively canceling their debts and transferring advisors and materiel, we have the ability to do just that, while also ensuring our arms manufacturers have the steady flow of orders to needed to maintain their enterprises."

 eng.1000.d:0 "There have been a number of reasons why the great powers of the world have turned to protectionism in the past few years. Initially, the response of many to the start of the Great Depression was to rush to protect domestic markets and farmers, and then the Franco-Russian repudiation of war debts made relying on others even less attractive. We are no exception to that rule. Keeping the Commonwealth together economically and politically has been our main priority, especially after what happened in India. \n\nAnd now the Americans, somewhere near rock bottom, are asking if we would like to expand free trade between them and our bloc. \n\nThere is just too much Parliamentary opposition to the deal. The potential impacts on Canadian and British agricultural interests are too great. Concerns about displacing our own battered industry are also rife. Together, much of Labour and the Tories are too reluctant to pursue this avenue. Not while we are worried about rocking our own boat."
