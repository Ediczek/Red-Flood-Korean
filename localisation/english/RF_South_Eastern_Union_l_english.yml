 POLITICS_KALEDIN_DESC:0 "칼리딘은 러시아 제국 내 돈 카자키 자치권 유지에 기여하는 데 자긍심을 가집니다. 대부분의 러시아인들이 카자크의 생활방식에 무지하기에, 칼리딘은 자신의 영역 안에서 카자크의 정신이 살아있음을 다행으로 여기고 있습니다. 하지만 이 가냘픈 평화는 러시아 제국의 가냘픈 정치에 달린 것이며, 그것이 얼마나 오래갈 진 아무도 모릅니다."
 DKB_DESC_MENU:0 "내전의 발발로써, 카자크군들과 여러 지역정치체의 총합으로 주로 구성된 남동연합은 탄생하게 되었습니다. 늙고 신망 받는 장군 알렉세이 칼리딘이 이끄는 연합은 볼가 강의 가뭄 직후 이어진 1921년의 기근이 가장 큰 화제가 될 정도로 내전의 혼란에서 그나마 몸을 피할 수 있었습니다. 그 이후로 칼리딘은 주어진 만큼의 통제권을 자신의 작은 영토 안에서 유지하며, 농업 및 산업발전을 통해 연합을 부강하게 만들었습니다. 하지만 1935년 노동파업의 결과들이 러시아 전역을 강타하게 되었으니, 칼리딘 역시 마주하게 된 사안들에 대해 목소리를 내라 강제당할 것입니다."

Although the saints have seen fit to preserve Holy Russia for the time being, its politics are frayed to a near-breaking point, and the Southeastern Union is no different. Governed by Don Cossack cavalry general Alexei Kaledin, the Southeastern Union is one of the few places in the Russian Empire which is governed by a leader from the local ethnic group. Still, however, many Cossacks yearn for an end to Russian rule, and the significant Ukrainian minority in the region is also making itself known. There are even whispers of men both within and without the government who seek to restore the ancient Scythian Empire… and while this is obviously ridiculous, the rumors are far too prevalent to be ignored. Such disunited politics, as well as a general disagreement over an ethnic identity for the Southeastern Union, have earned this warlord state the title, “Russia's Little Slice of Limbo”, as the area seems in constant danger of becoming something brand new at any moment, and can't stick to one identity.\n\nEven as Kaledin continues to rule with an iron fist, he knows that time is running short for him and his band of merry men. All that it would take for the entire region to go up in flames is one false move or freak accident which could send the entire empire into collapse. And although Kaledin knows these things, he is determined to protect his realm and his people, just as he always has, down to his last breath."

The first item on the agenda is what currency should be used by the region. Russian loyalists are suggesting we declare the Ruble as our official currency, as it has acted as our unofficial currency until now, and could draw us closer to the Russian Empire. Critics of this proposal have pointed out the decreasing value of the ruble, and though they haven't been able to reference it directly, references have been made to Russia's approaching collapse. Some have suggested that we switch to the Hryvnia, a Ukrainian currency which has greater value than the Ruble, and may offer us a path towards economic cooperation with the Intermarium. A third proposal suggests that we use only Chervonets, or large gold coins, and mint them using Ugric gold. None are quite sure where this proposal originated from, and some are wary that shadowy figures are trying to manipulate the Krug from the shadows. Despite this, many have supported this proposal, as the coins would offer economic stability while still being backed by the Ruble."

The Chernomortsy retorts, saying that it's better to decentralize the Army and allow for a looser command chain, resulting in better coordination of local divisions, as they claim that the cost for these modernizations would be too much. The Lineytsy agree on the last part, yet believe that ever further centralization would be better for the organization of Divisions under one, united Army Command.

The issue facing the Krug is what language school should be taught in. While the natural instinct is obviously to keep classes in Russian, many have pointed out that this is unfair to children who don't know Russian, as there is currently no public program to teach the language. The opposition has proposed instead that individual schools decide which language to teach in based on their students, which is seen by most as a fair compromise. However, the mysterious group who keeps making proposals to the Krug have struck once again, this time with a harsh proposition. Their proposal states that Russian schools should not only be taught only in Russian, but that only ethnic Russians should be able to attend. According to their logic, the “lesser races” of the Russian Empire are simply incapable of proper Russian education, so instead they should be given rudimentary education by their parents, and then used as a cheap, uneducated labor force.

It was generally believed that the Lineytsy proposal to strengthen the Union government would be the beginning and end of the discussion, but as always, the opposition argues to the contrary. Instead, they say local autonomy as a value of Russian Imperialism, and to disavow such a policy would be to disavow the Empire itself. Seemingly in response to this notion, a third proposal has once again made its way to the Krug, arguing for the total abolishment of autonomy altogether. This organization, who have revealed themselves as the Scythists, argue that a disunited empire is not truly an empire to begin with. They see the policy of autonomy as cowardice by the former Tsars, who did not have the courage to tame the peoples of the Russian wilds.

Citing a lack of faith in the Union to protect the interest of minority groups as well as the general chaos of the political scene. The move has been welcomed by a substantial number of people in the South who have become disillusioned with the Union's government and have placed their faith in a governing entity which they feel will be more competent at meeting their needs and desires.\n\nThe same however cannot be said for the Union. The breakaway of the Mountain Republic has only added to dissatisfaction and political turmoil within the Union. Leading to a decision to mobilise forces stationed in the Terek region to try and subdue the rebellious republic. It remains to be seen if order will be restored, or if the façade of Central Authority will quickly collapse."

But the Republic continuing to exist would surely spell doom for the Union, an immediate end for them would certainly give the Union a sporting chance of coming back from the brink. \n\nOn account of the fact that the Mountain Republic was hastily formed making their armies a disorganised series of local militias, no one would have guessed that the Mountain Republic was long for this world, and certainly this was the case. The Mountain Republic's forces were nothing compared to Union forces. Defeat instead came from where it was least expected. Within the Union. \n\nWhen the order was announced for forces within Terek to march on the Mountain Republic, protest and outrage broke out within the ranks. There were various reasons for this. Some soldiers did not feel loyalty to a decaying and turbulent regime, others sympathised with the motives of the Mountain Republic and others seditious elements harboured Councilist Sympathies. All these factors resulted in a mutiny against local officials and commanders ultimately resulting in the seizure of military barracks and government buildings in the city of Terek, leading to the creation of the Terek People's Republic and its declaration of independence from the Union.\n\nIt thus seems obvious now, that any facade of central authority is impossible to maintain. Unrest is rapidly spreading throughout the Union with reports of riots, skirmishes and protests breaking out across the nation.

But the declaration of independence by the Ural Host makes such a course of action impossible. In fact, there have even been reports of some Cossack divisions raiding and assaulting parts of the countryside due to delayed payments which has resulted in some skirmishes between irregulars, the odd professional battalion of troops and Cossack divisions. This has had some positive effect, as anger towards Cossack aggression has led to some rise in volunteers in the army. \n\nBut it seems certain that these are only short term gains.

Disillusioned with the once hopeful experiment that was an independent South-Eastern Union, the Astrakhan Governorate seeks, in the future, to become reunited with Russia, but as the Governorate is racked with instability from the incompetence of the governors of the country and province. as well as raids from the Ural Host and Tsaritsyn, such goals are recognised to be something for the future. For now the Governorate will seek to secure stability in the region, in order to prepare it for a reunification of the region so that it may swiftly be re-integrated into Russia. \n\nTechnically speaking, this is not new news. The Astrakhan Province had effectively become independent after chaos consumed the Krug, being subservient to the Krug only in writing.
