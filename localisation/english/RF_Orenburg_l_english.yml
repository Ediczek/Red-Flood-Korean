ORE_DESC_MENU:0 "내전의 발발은 군사지구 체제가 너무나 비효율적임을 모든 정당들 앞에 보여주었습니다. 알렉산드르 두토프와 그의 카자키 자치대가 이끄는 오렌부르크 군사지구는 이런 상황 속에서 태어났습니다. 중립을 유지했어야 했을 두토프는 분쟁 당시 콜차크에게 자신의 몫을 걸었습니다. 카자흐 시위가 진압된 이후 알라쉬 정당들은 대놓고 두토프에 반대하기 시작했습니다. 1932년과 33년의 기근이 친공산주의 향민 봉기로 이어지며 상황은 악화됐습니다. 오렌부르크 군사지구의 동란은 대체로 끝난 듯해도, 오렌부르크 위로 날아들 독수리들이 모습을 드러낼진 지켜볼 일입니다."
POLITICS_ALEX_DUTOV_DESC:0 "알렉산드르 두토프가 가진 풍부한 카자크 연대 지휘 경험은 오렌부르크 카자키 통치에 필요한 재주를 그에게 주었습니다. 두토프의 업무는 두 가지입니다. 오렌부르크 영토를 러시아의 통제하에 두고, 그에 맞서는 이는 모두 죽이는 것. 단련된 러시아 군인으로서, 두토프는 두 직무를 기꺼이 수행해내고 있습니다."

ore.1.t:0 "익명의 편지"
ore.1.d:0 "\"일리치, 편지 왔습니다.\" 올려다 본 두토프는 감사를 표하며 taking the wrinkled envelope from his hands. 오렌부르크의 지도자로 재직하는 동안 두토프는 긍정되거나 부정된 내용을 담은 상당량의 편지들을 받아봤습니다. 편지에 무슨 내용이 담겼는가를 맞혀 보는 건 항상 흥미진진한 놀라움이었습니다. 두토프는 긍정된 내용의 편지를 더 좋아했지만, 빠르게 훑어본 내용은 편지가 후자의 유형임을 내보였습니다. \n\n\"치욕스러운 알렉산드르 일리치 두토프에게, 네놈의 장기가 네 몸 속에서 썩어가길 바라며. 러시아국의 폭압이 너무나 오랫동안 카자흐인들과 노동자, 그리고 수많는 이들을 짓눌렀지만 너는 채찍을 쥔 손으로 우리를 대했다. 악의 현현인 네놈은 모스크바에 있는 네 인형술사에게만 복종할 뿐. 억압의 하수인인 너는 네 발 아래 있는 모든 이들에게 부당한 위계를 강요해왔다. 네놈의 통치를 무너뜨리고 네 시체를 거리에 끌고 다니길 참을 수가 없구나.\" \n\nAs Dutov finished reading through the verbal assault, 편지를 구기곤 집어던졌습니다. He was no stranger to demeaning messages, and each time the small sting grew less and less. At this point they had almost no effect on the man, for it was so normalized in his psyche. 한 명의 분노가 잠을 설칠 거리가 되진 않았습니다. 어쨌거나..."

ore.2.t:0 "기의"
ore.2.d:0 "알렉세이 이바노비치 됴민은 shifted his coat, the sweat seeping through despite the light smattering of snow falling from above. 오렌부르크 앞에서 행해질 아타만 두토프의 연설은, 요즘과 같이 어려운 때에 특히나 중요했습니다. 더욱이 두토프가 군중에게 더 \"평화로우며 환대하는\" 분위기를 주려 경호원들을 무대 뒤로 물리길 원하면서 경호원으로서 됴민의 직업은 그 어느 때보다도 어려워지게 되었습니다. 일반인들에게 더 가까이 다가가려는 아타만의 바보 같은 소원은 보안수칙을 크게 위반하는 것이었지만, 알렉세이는 상관의 직할명령에 불복하고 싶지 않았습니다. \n\nAs the speech started, Alexei tried to ponder ways in which he could still protect the Ataman in a way that would be more discrete than usual, even if it had the downside of making Dutov appear more vulnerable. After a short period of deliberation, he realized he could attempt to blend into the crowd, and although he would be abandoning his post in technicality, he felt that the safety of the Ataman stood at a higher priority than simple orders. With his mind made up, Alexei chose to..."

ore.6.d:0 "때마다 알렉세이는 군중을 살펴보았습니다. 특별히 움직이던 것도 없었고, 누구도 수상하게 굴지 않았으며, 눈에는 눈물이 고이기 시작했습니다. 더 나은 감시를 위해 최소한의 깜빡임만 유지하던 비인간적 행동의 결과였습니다. 차가운 바람이 그의 동공에 눈을 쏟고 얼굴의 땀은 얼어붙은 것이, 마치 하느님께서 아무것도 아닌 일로 알렉세이를 시험하시는 듯했습니다. 아무 일도 벌어지지 않았고, 아무 일도 벌어지지 않을 것입니다. 이번 행사는 평화로울 것이라던 두토프가 옳다는 생각과 함께, 알렉세이는 다시 눈을 깜빡였습니다. \n\n그러나 눈을 뜬 알렉세이에게 보인 건 반사의 반짝임이 외피 속으로 사라지는 모습이었습니다. 총이었을까요? 커다랗게 뜬 그의 눈은 focused solely on the man awkwardly shuffling around with his pockets, 무대를 향해 걸어오기 시작한 사내는 10배는 더 수상하게 보였습니다. 사내는 알렉세이의 얼어붙은 초병에게 시선을 고정하고선 순식간에 무대를 향해 달려들었습니다.\n\n\"일리치!\" 알렉세이가 전력으로 질주하며 소리쳤습니다. \"숙여요!\" The man leaped onstage, brandishing a grenade with the pin already pulled. In a split second deliberation, Alexei knew what must be done, and as he tackled the suicide bomber to the floor, he let his eyes rest one final time, safe with the fact that his job had been fulfilled."

ore.7.t:0 "평화로운 눈밭에서"
ore.7.d:0 "As Alexei weaved through the dense crowd, doubts raced across his mind, doubts which he quickly snuffed as simple paranoia induced by stress. He had a job to do which required his upmost attention, and any distractions would be disasterous to the safety of the Ataman, and thus the nation of Orenburg as a whole. He alone stood between Hell and Heaven, as the guardian of life and death. \n\nAlexei's slow shuffle through the powdersnow was impeded by the jostling of the crowd, and more often than once he had been blocked from any movement for precious seconds, a risk that he could not afford to take. As he continued surveying the area, he noticed a man infront of him check over his shoulder before moving towards the stage. Alexei, the vigilant guardian he was, flung himself forward, engaging the mystery man in a chase. The Ataman's face was surprised at this disturbance, and when he turned around to find Alexei missing, his fate was already sealed. \n\nThe man lept onto the stage and into Dutov, before a blinding explosion with the brightness of the Sun threw shrapnel across the crowd. Alexei fell face-down into the same soft snow that had kept him still, his conciousness knocked out from him. The bloody pulp that used to lead Orenburg sizzled, as the snow kept falling as though nothing had happened."

ore.4.d:0 "두토프 장군이 사망하고 그가 가장 두려워하던 일이 벌이지고 말았습니다. 도시이자 지구로서의 오렌부르크가 혼돈에 휩싸인 것입니다. A chain of explosions rattled the city early this morning with a series of massive hollow booms, and bands of Kazakh partisans, pre-positioned in workhouses and factory dormitories or packed into leased-out flophouses, flooded out into the city. 일부 집단은 간신히 진압됐지만, 다른 무리는 도시를 돌파하고 벽촌을 포위하며 전략거점을 점령하는 등 훈련의 분명한 기미와 함께 통일된 무기체계를 보였습니다. 반군과 준군사 경찰대가 주고받는 총성이 오렌부르크 전역에서 메아리쳤습니다. The citizens have vanished, huddling in their homes and hoping to avoid stray bullets, or else hunkering down with what arms they possess to defend their own property. However, something is amiss in this attempt at a while coup. Messages have gone out, missives dispatched by an anonymous writer claiming to be a general officer of the Orenburg Russian Army, to the garrisons surrounding the city. The missives order the troops to assemble and immediately march on critical positions, doubtlessly putting them into direct conflict with the rebels. But with the source of these missives unknown and their authority dubious at best, the officers are quarreling over the proper response. It remains to be seen how many, if any, of the garrison commanders will march If enough of them move quickly, their regular troops will no doubt crush the irregular partisans. A partial or piecemeal response from the army will likely hand victory to the rebels and traitors - but with Dutov dead and Orenburg in chaos, it is a mystery who would have both the means and motive to arrange the failure of the revolt."

ore.8.desc:0 "The stage is set. White garlands hanging up high from tall branches matched the thick carpet of snow in the grass - unusual around this time in this part of the country, but nonetheless an auspicious sign. To each side of the long path to the small stone parish, peasants and soldiers waited with impatient glee for the great event.  \n\nWith slow and wide steps walks Elder Grigory. With an imposing height and a beard a white much brighter than the snow, he holds a woman by her arm. She meekly follows along. Dressed in exhuberant traditional clothes, this is none other than sweet Olga. The crowd hold their breath, as to not break the enchantment of the scene. When they reach the chapel, Rasputin's towering figure puts the small church to shame. A young boy hands the monk a wreath of white roses. Sadly, there are no more "royal" crown for the soon-to-be Queen, but the peasant simplicity of this floral tiara only contributes to the scene. \n\nOlga kneels elegantly, as she did in the dances and masquerades of the Imperial Court she left behind. Rasputin, with a silvery voice,pronounces a formulaic prayer, before gently letting the wreath rest on Olga's temples. He lifts her up by her marble hand, and presents the new Tsarista to the public."

ore.9.t:0 "Week of the Butterlady"
ore.9.desc:0 "Masha always looked forward to "Maslenitsa" as it was one of her favorite times of the year, even when it was starting the Lenten season. She helped prepare sweet blini with her mother and grandmother. She brought the eggs to the kitchen as her mother had asked her to do so. She turned to her daughter and said. \n\n\"Masha, as if you were so good. Could you make blini dough? I don't have any hands and we need to make another batch.\" \n\nHer mom said as she carried a hot plate full of pastries to the outside table. Her grandmother smiled a secret at her and said. \n\n\"Well Masha, we'll be able to do this together?\" \n\nMasha nodded and saluted her grandmother. She put the eggs on the table and began searching the kitchen for flour. Finally she found her while Grandma was breaking eggs. Masha brought the flour and put it on the counter. Grandma poured it into a bowl and added milk, eggs, water and salt. Finally she also added melted butter inside. And she gave Masha a bowl and a spoon for her to stir it. The little girl did so and handed the bowl back to her grandmother who started putting the dough into the pan to fry the blini. The smell of the pancakes caught the attention of the gray-and-white family cat of the Jazz, who hopped on a chair and stared intently at the plate of tasty pancakes. Babushka, however, scared him so that he would not try to eat them. Eventually, however, her mother came and she had something in her hand that made Masha happy. It was a beautiful folk dress and a colorful kokoshnik that she had been asking her parents for for a long time. She ran to her mother and asked. \n\n\"Is this for me? It’s wonderful! I always wanted a dress like this!\" \n\n\"Yes my dear. I bought it from Mr.Yezhnev when he visited our village. I thought that it would be really nice if you could dance with other girls in this.\" \n\n\"Thank you thank you!\" \n\nThe girl said and ran to another room where she dressed quickly and, regardless of her mother and grandmother, ran outside the house. The first thing she experienced after leaving the hut was a snowball made by Igor - a boy she liked. She giggled and started collecting snowballs in her hands to start a snowball fight with them. Hiding around the corner of the houses, more and more children began to join their skirmish in colorful flowery costumes until they were all tired and soaked. When the parents saw their children when they returned home, they were nervous because the costumes had to dry for the festive dance. However, their anger did not last long as the next day was "Forgiveness Sunday". Masha danced a beautiful dance in a quickly dried outfit with Igor in front of the whole village with the rest of the children and young men, and the father himself hugged her, being proud of her. The whole family, father, mother, Masha and grandmother listened to the priest's short sermon. \n\n\"As every year, Maslenitsa reminds us of passing, but also of the joy of life that comes from Jesus Christ. Remember, that the time of the Lord's judgment is  coming for us at a fast pace and we must remember that all good things on this earth will eventually come to an end. For there is no joy greater than the source of all joy which is God. Everything comes from God and everything will return to God. Remember my dear brothers and sisters in Christ! We are ashes, and from the ground we rose and returned to the ground!\" \n\nSeeing the reverie and sadness of the whole congregation, the priest, however, cheered up and stopped speaking in his loud sacral voice. \n\n\"But let's have fun, because every saint is smiling. Bring in the Maslenitsa Effigy!\" \n\nThe two men went to a nearby barn to pull out a decorated hay doll that was supposed to be Maslenitsa. It was created by all young men looking for a bride, hoping that Maslenitsa would bring them happiness. At the same time, mother-in-law met with their sons' wives and bride to forge new friendships by frying bliny. The men hung the puppet on a pole and all the villagers began to bring the remains of the pancakes and put them next to the puppet, mixing them with flammable straw. At first Masha did not understand why it was done, but her mother explained that it is used to fertilize the fields and to bring fertility. She nodded as she watched Maslenitsa burn, symbolizing the end of winter and the beginning of Lent and Spring."

ore.10.t:0 "Full of Ecstasy and Fire"
ore.10.desc:0 "Tales were told about the new ruler of Orenburg. With the strength of a bear, his eyes glowed like a flame. He was old, with a long gray beard, yet his heart was still beating with boldness. Most people spoke about him with terror and with fear. This man was called Grigory Rasputin and he prepared for another Easter. Through the whole lent he whipped himself and tried not to eat anything while trying to mortify his own flesh. The faithful saw that in spite of the demands he imposed on himself, he remained of great faith, setting an example for his fellow believers. Like him, many took off their robes while walking only in undershirts, whipped themselves and fasted - women, men, children and the elderly. Eventually, however, the period of reflection was over and it was the time of celebration. Rasputin entered the room and knelt. He did not invite anyone, but he did not forbid anyone from entering the room, so many gathered in the room with him. Eventually, however, he knelt down and began repeating a sentence over and over and over again. \n\n\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\" \n\nFollowing their teacher, many also got down on their knees and began saying a prayer. Eventually, however, Rasputin got up and spoke to the crowd. \n\n\"I thank you my brothers and sisters in Christ for this moment of prayer together, and now let us rejoice because Christ is risen!\" \n\nAnd the crowd cheered and Rasputin asked for a \"special\" Kvass (which he called holly), nuts, sunflower seeds, bread and honey. He spoke again when food was distributed to the congregation. \"Take and eat; this is my body! Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom\"  \n\nThey served each other food and drank the Kvass together. Eventually one woman got up from a kneeling position and tore off her top coat, becoming half-naked. She screamed out loud as if she was under the effect of an aphrodisiac and other intoxicating substances. \"I’m full of ecstasy and fire! I feel like the Holy Spirit descended upon me. Praise the Lord!\" \n\nShe began to dance wildly, and many of them began to feel a similar elation. In the end, however, she ran into the dull man and hugged him, and even though he did not know her and despite his shock, he hugged her as well. Rasputin himself was neither eating nor drinking, but also joined the wild joyful dance. They ate and drank beyond their control. Even Sodom and Gomorrah could envy them right now and there was no Lot to save them from this joyful festival of sin. Quickly the room filled with naked bodies rubbing against other bodies. Man with man, woman with woman, man with woman - it didn't matter who with who, but the only thing that mattered was the fact that the Holy Spirit descended and gave His favors to all of them. Rasputin himself undressed as well, and despite his age, he was still vigorous and his body was a muscular fiery temple of the holy spirit. Many women were eager to intercourse with him. After hours of wild orgy, everyone fell exhausted and intoxicated. Only Rasputin stood over them all, still fully conscious and sober. His whole life was full of ecstasy and fire, so for him this situation was nothing new. He put on his robes and slowly left the room, leaving tired people to fend for themselves. Many then began to call him \"the living god\" even though he asked not to be called that. The people ignored his request saying that they saw him leave the room after this holy orgy by passing through the wall and others shouted to him saying that he isn’t merely a man but an angel struck by his beauty. Eventually, life returned to its normal course, although everyone remembered well what had happened on the day of the resurrection. However, many were ashamed to speak of it or felt that the experience could not be repeated. Thanks to this, this orgy became an open secret to everyone and no one dared to criticize Rasputin seeing it as a miracle rather than a sin."

ore.11.desc:0 "Father Yemelyanovich never worried too much about the priest's activities, he rarely celebrated mass, the more god-fearing believers threatened him with hell if they did not deprive him of his valuables, and he was cursed by the more conscious inhabitants of these wastes for his apathy towards the dying sick who demanded blessing and viaticum. He was sitting in his office decorated with many icons staring menacingly at everyone who entered his house. He licked his sausage-fat lips and continued counting money, taking the coins in his as thick as sausages that his hands ate and arranging them carefully. He noticed, however, that outside the window, behind which snow had been snowing for several days, something was moving and shining. He was surprised because he did not expect any visit and his house itself was a few kilometers away from other houses. He lifted his fat body from the armchair and shuffled towards the window to peer out, rubbed the glass and saw a sight that disturbed him. A procession of peasants in winter clothes holding torches passed in front of his house. He expected that some communists or other madmen could raid the clergy, so he quickly removed his clothes, cross and tried to remove as many icons as possible and hide them under the table and tablecloth. With his eye he noticed that the procession was already standing in front of his house, so he put on a coat over his country shirt and left his hut where immediately, when he closed the door behind him, he heard a loud scream from the crowd of a man. \n\n\"FATHER YEMELYANOVICH\" \n\nHis worst and innermost fears were confirmed. An old man, whom Yemelyanovich recognized, stepped in front of the line. He thought he was already dead, because a few weeks ago his son was knocking on his door from morning to night. He began to recognize more and more faces in the crowd that were the faces of angry villagers from nearby towns. The old man continued his speech, full of pain and envy. \n\n\"Father Yemelyanovich, you are a channel of these lands and a parasite on the holy body of Christ, if only you were the only divine messenger, I would already be dead and without hope... Like many of those gathered here... But we have been enlightened by one man - Father Rasputin. He. He is a living saint and an example to the faithful of the Church. He healed me, bandaged my wounds and the grace of God fell on me through his hands and I got up! Can you say that you have done similar wonderful deeds, Messenger of Mammon?\" \n\n\"Relax! We can explain everything! Christ said you must love your neighbor…\" \n\nSaid embarrassed Yemelyanovich tried to calm the crowd, but in vain. \n\n\"And he also said that he will bring a sword! Brothers and sisters! Give the poor the riches of this parasite! And get him out by his rags!\" \n\nThe old man shouted and the whole crowd burst into the house, taking out all the riches and distributing the trinkets among themselves. The priest tried to stop them screaming in despair and wringing his hands, but they also carried him out and led him to a lower field, where in the darkness there was a pole next to a pile of wood, books and other flammable objects. The old man watched as the fat young priest was dragged by three strong men and tied to the pole. He tried to break free, but could not. The villagers with torches approached the stake and lit it, and the cleric began to shout even louder, asking for deliverance from the Lord. The Lord, however, was deaf when the fires consumed him and his sinful life. And the old man smiled, seeing that justice had been done, speaking only one word very softly in whisper"

We, with loving embrace, accept and welcome the eerie world of rituals and sorcery of our peasants, and incorporate their customs to our neverending spiritual warfare for the soul of All Russia. With Christ and witches on our side, who dares stand against us?"
ORE_peoples_faith:0 "The People's Faith"
ORE_peoples_faith_desc:0 "The fattened and corrupt bishops of Russia have plotted a ruthless and systematic persecution of true and innocent religious expressions, such as the good men among the bezpopovtsy, the stranniki, honest rites condemned by the devious Patriarchs as “schismatics”. The Church, however, does not realize these cults and confessions are closer to God than they could ever be, as they are natural expressions of the folk’s faith. Tailored to their world and legends, they are in contact with deep mystical forces and thus should be encouraged, while the oligarchical hierarchy of fallen priests shall be disbanded wherever we go."
ORE_russian_messianism:0 "Russian Messianism"
ORE_russian_messianism_desc:0 "It is our sincere and proud belief that the Holy Land of Rus occupies a unique metaphysical space in the cosmos and fulfills a grand purpose in God’s great historical plan. Our Russia is the golden heart of religion and everlasting love, destined to sublate itself into the Anointed Nation to guide all humanity towards Heaven and Truth. We will assume this role in the universal stage and work tirelessly with this one aim: to make God’s will on Earth materialize through His faithful servants."
ORE_modern_bogatyrs:0 "The Modern Bogatyrs"
ORE_modern_bogatyrs_desc:0 "In our ballads we speak of the bogatyrs, grandiose heroes of great power and might who roam the land in defense of goodness and the innocent. They are guided by gallant principles although they tend to be fierce and temperamental, but nonetheless their courage is the stuff of legend. The Great Saint Ilya of Murom was even canonized for his epic deeds. In our forging of a new balladry for a new age we will recreate the figure of the bogatyr like one builds from clay and mud. Our armies are the heirs of this legend and will create a legend for themselves in the coming war."
ORE_promised_kingdom:0 "The Promised Kingdom"
ORE_promised_kingdom_desc:0 "In the not so ancient past, holy men whom the people referred to as \"wanderers\" spread the fantastic tale of the Kingdom of Belovodye. A fertile territory in which there was absolute freedom to practice any rite, with innumerable precious metals beneath the frosted earth, where there were no crimes or theft, and free peasant communities could settle the land to their whim. The true lesson of this story was sadly lost in history, but we understand. Belovodye is not escapism to an imaginary kingdom, but a promise. A goal. We will strive and toil to make Russia our Belovodye, a Kingdom of freedom, of love, of rivers of honey and milk and of immense riches to be given to the common folk of all the Empire."
ORE_return_to_myth:0 "Return to Myth"
ORE_return_to_myth_desc:0 "The cruelest of crimes is how the modern world has been stripped away from beauty. No longer witches hide in cabins, the Earth does not tremble at the stomping of great heroes, no monsters slither in the forests, the meadows have a tragic lack of nymphs, and wandering spirits are nowhere to be found. Our labor is not only to give peasants their earthly needs, but attend to the hunger of their soul. The men of intellect offer nothing but cold and inhuman sciences. The power of building their own world has been taken away from the common folk. They crave myths long lost. And so we shall give them what they need. Let the fairies float from lily to lily! Fear the darkness which demons inhabit! Bring offerings to the great powers of nature! They shall wander a world of terrible and incredible beauty, a mosaic of stories that conform a great piece of art to God Above! Let us return to wild freedom! Let us return to myth!"
ORE_smite_zhmey:0 "Smite the Zmey"
ORE_smite_zhmey_desc:0 "Far, far away from our land, there reigns the absolute chaos of the dragon-serpent. The monster has many heads and each is more furious than the rest, devouring anything in their way and biting each other in their frenzy. Its gargantuan neck slithers across the Empire and strangles and suffocates men of honor and men of faith alike. This monster, this zmey, must be brought to its knees and killed head by head if Russia is to be free. Our armorers forge guns for a new generation of knights, cars roar with the sound of great beasts of old, and our armies give praise to God as they are ready for one last and great war. The time is right! Sound the horns of battle! For Holy Rus, God, and Saint Grigori!"
ORE_subdue_cossacks:0 "Subdue the Cossacks"
ORE_subdue_cossacks_desc:0 "The head known as Cossackia is among the most fierce and bloodthirsty of them all. These free riders of the steppes and valleys have a reputation for being hardened warriors and completely ungovernable by conventional means. The natives of the Caucasus are much alike, hiding away in their solomonic mountains and ambushing their enemies like common bandits. When the fires of civil strife engulfed our country they stood aside and let it burn, as the atamans fattened their treasuries with the spoils of the defeated and the wages of the victors alike. These unpredictable men, nonetheless, provide us with an incredible advantage should we succeed in making them bend the knee. When our men defeat these dangerous foes, every ataman and chieftain must swear fealty to the Elder and provide the best of the best to soar the numbers of our triumphal columns."
ORE_rule_steppes:0 "Rule the Steppes"
ORE_rule_steppes_desc:0 "To the immediate east and extending far to the south, the emerald and saffron plains of the great steppe are a main objective in our campaign. This head of the zmey was born out of the Tzar’s need for perpetual expansion, settling the lands of the semi-nomadic Turkmen with poor Russian peasants who are now all but forgotten. We shall restore order to the steppe, and liberate Christian and Mahometan alike from the yoke of military dictators and the bandit plague. The Turks shall be left to their own devices within the Rus’ protection, respecting their traditional structures of power and harmonizing them with the Russian colonists and their needs. Onwards, ride to the east!"
ORE_empire_of_north:0 "Empire of the North"
ORE_empire_of_north_desc:0 "The next stop in our crusade is the brutal and frozen north. A harsh and unforgiving realm that has forced the colonists to adapt to the cold lashes of eternal winter, this has given many a-tyrant the authority and freedom to do as they please. The land of Yakuts is in much the same situation. South of them, another tale is sung. The godless and the red madmen were exiled to this ridiculous Asian statelet, to continue pretending they practiced true freedom and equality within their little republican oligarchy. History and our righteous might will prove these evildoers that the common folk need not despots nor rabble rousers, but the Loving hand of God and the freedom of the ancient lifestyle."
ORE_walk_into_kremlin:0 "Walk Into the Kremlin"
ORE_walk_into_kremlin_desc:0 "It had to come to this. The Moscovite legion of bureaucrats and generals, who so cruelly denied our sweet Olga’s claim to the throne, are the ultimate and sole catalyst of Russia’s recent woes. Despite being the heartland of the history of our people they have bitterly betrayed everything they stood for and those they were supposed to protect. As such, retribution is as natural and expected as a storm on the far-stretching horizon. We will not stop at Moscow. We will not stop at Petrograd. We will not stop, our struggle won’t ever cease, until every remnant of the devious and faithless brutality of the Empire is paid accordingly to the devils who have made us retort to such a crusade. This is what God wants and what they deserve."
ORE_peace_holy_rus:0 "Peace in Holy Rus"
ORE_peace_holy_rus_desc:0 "Hear the soft laughter of the peasants in the fields. Hear their honest and humble prayers around the dinner table. Hear the birds, the wind caressing the land, the meadows and the stomps of cloven hooves, and you will then understand. The war, the crusade, the strife, it has come to a triumphal end. There is no echo of mechanized monsters or the whistling of bullets. Russia, for the first time in many years, knows peace and an angelic stability that will continue for as long as we remember the sacrifices we made and the precepts we hold dear. This is the triumph of Peace and the Coronation of Love."
