The scientist squirmed in front of him, clearly uncomfortable receiving this much attention from a man carrying a rifle. He glanced to his handiwork, and glanced back at the hulking mercenary in front of him, eyes flicking every now and then to the skull cap badge that festooned the man’s beret. \n\n 'Science?' He squeaked helplessly.\n 'So, let me get this straight,” the merc snapped, 'You took two M1919s and strapped them to a cow...for science?' \n 'Well,' The scientist stammered awkwardly, trying not to stare at the cow rampaging through the town behind the merc, smashing holes in walls and causing accidental discharges as debris caught on triggers. People screamed and attempted to run out of the way of the one bovine stampede, some failing and falling under its hooves. One unfortunate was caught by a stray round.\n'I thought we could use it as a battle platform.'\n 'A battle platform.'\n It wasn't a question.\n 'Yes, like one of those jeeps, you know, but organic so it wouldn’t harm the forest.' \n 'For Christ’s s-' the merc started, then choked to a stop, 'No, you know what, shut the fuck up.' \n'What will you do with the c-' \n 'Shut the fuck up, or I’ll do it to you.' \n The merc turned towards the village and took aim."

 ass.2.desc:0 "어머조너스 과학령의 수립 이래, Orlando Villas Boas has displayed a keen interest in establishing contact with the local indigenous tribe, the Waimiri Atroari. An indigenist, and a lover of all things indiginous, Boas’s interest is perhaps not shocking to those in the know. Boas envisions a society built for the protection of the Amazon and its indigenous peoples, and believes that the best way to go about this is to negotiate with the tribes themselves. Perhaps, he claims, they could even take their place as defenders of the land.\nOn the flip side, the leader of the mercenaries, Amleto Vespa, has questioned the wisdom of such an action. The Wamiri Atroari, he points out, are notorious for their violence against outsiders. Why, he wonders, would they treat this group any differently from all the rest? \n The tension is real, and the decision has to be made."

 ass.3.desc:0 "The canopy appeared to devour the sky. An endless, vertical carpet of verdant green leaves and tangles of vines, precious little light bled through the organic ceiling of the Amazon. Vespa’s men stumbled through this twilight country, uneasy and nervous. They spoke in hushed whispers, eyes darting between the ravenous looking shadows that lay between the trees. Shapes, the hint of shapes, all of these spoke of endless menace and agonizing death. Unidentifiable noises buzzed between the trees. Birds? Insects? Something more sinister? \n\n The endless chain smoking that occupied the mercenaries was now nowhere to be found. \n Vespa led his column, seemingly as relaxed as he ever was. He strode with deliberation over roots and fallen branches, eyes open for the movement of poisonous and deadly animals, and for the most dangerous ones of all, other people. He saw nothing. He inhaled deeply, and grimaced. The Amazon smelled of life that died. He thought he saw something move, somewhere deep in the green tinted half-darkness. He raised his hand for a pause.\n His men went on their knees, facing outwards, covering every conceivable angle of attack. Machine guns faced up and down the path they had taken. It was a formation designed to make ambush difficult, spread out and multifaceted as it was. \n It didn’t save them. \n The first arrow struck Vespa dead in the chest. His eyes widened as the barb bit deep, tearing through flesh and notching bone. He crumpled where he knelt, eyes glazing as poison coursed through his veins and shut down his heart. The reaction was almost instant. His men cried out, swearing and hollering, voices dulled against the verdant black. They began to fire. The arrow had come from seemingly nowhere, and they fired into nowhere. The sharp cracks of their rifles found nothing to echo against, muffled and pathetic. \n The next volley drove them back. They fled, firing as they went. There, left in the mud, the cruppled and leaking forms of their commander and comrades. The blackness swallowed them whole, and they were seen no more."

 ass.4.t:0 "잃어버린 낙원"
 ass.4.desc:0 "'I've just had about enough of this utopian bullshit,' one of the mercs snapped. \n He took an angry drag of his cigarette as murmurs of affirmation spread between his comrades. They sat in one of the many stifling, tight packed barracks houses that had defined life in the Amazon since they had arrived. The humidity made the walls sweat, and the men more so. The air was barely fit to breathe, thick and soupy as it was, made worse by the smoke that rose to the drafters and choked the lungs of those within. \n “We came here for a good go, right?” The merc exhaled, smoke mixing with the halo forming above, “And look where that’s gotten us!” \n “That’s right,” the man next to him piped up, “Vespa’s bitten it, and those four eyed fucks still want us to go into the jungle to make friends with people that are killing us.” \n “They pay well,” another observed, between puffs on a cigar. “Fuck pay,” the first man snarled, “There’s nothing to buy here, and none of us are going to make it out in one piece to use it at this rate.” The cigar smoker shrugged, unable or unwilling to come up with a rebuttal. “They’re pissing our lives away for this soft darkie loving vision of theirs. They need us to protect them, by their own admission, and then throw us away for their intellectual shit.” “It’s a fuck-up,” another voice agreed. “Yeah, a total goat-fuck. We’ve lost too many guys to the jungle already, and they don’t care. I mean, there’s also all of the stupid shit they pull for ‘research’. Had to beat the fuck out of one of them for mounting some of our MGs to a cow, and they docked my pa-”\n A throat cleared.\n All eyes turned to the man sitting in the back of the barracks hut. He slowly, deliberatively drew on his pipe, flattening his dark hair with his other hand. \n\n “This can’t go on,” Peter Fleming said at last. \n\n They wordlessly grabbed their rifles."

 ass.5.desc:0 "총성이 리우 브렁쿠의 거리에 울려퍼졌습니다. It stuttered against the backdrop of roaring engines and pounding, booted feet. Orlando Villas Boas hid beneath his deck, legs hugged against his chest. His ears were peeled. The unconscious lizard part of his brain had flung him here when he’d heard the doors of the faculty building blowing off their hinges with the starry tinkle of shattered glass. Blind panic hoped against his intellect that no one would think to look here. He knew, unconsciously, that he should have left while he had the chance. \n Shouting in the hallway. The slap, slap, slap of nice, soft shoes against linoleum floors. Just behind, the rushing thud of hard jackboots pounding up the stairs. The first shot jarred him. He jumped, unconsciously. A heavy, meaty crash resounded against the wall as someone slumped against it. The crying started low, moaning and pathetic. The boots trumped closer. He recognized his aide’s voice, trembling with fear and adrenaline. The man was pleading, begging. \n “Please!” The man wailed, “Why don’t we talk this out? I can up your pay, get you women, anything you want!” \n A distinctly French voice answered, “This is what I want, cuck.” \n The man’s shriek cut short  as something hard slammed against the wall again. He wasn’t dead yet. The aide whimpered, slumped against the wall as it carried the noise into the office beyond. Boas clenched his eyes shut. He thought he heard the sound of a bolt cycling. The second shot felt louder than the first. Boas may have let out a bark of fear, he wasn’t sure. The floor outside thudded again as the man in the boots turned. \n A brief pause.\n The door burst inwards, splintering under the force of the kick. The man stalked in predatory feet muffled against carpet. More boots stomped up the stairs. \n Boas had just enough presence of mind to remember the pistol he had foolishly left in the drawer of his desk. He couldn’t reach it now, not without being seen. He held his breath, praying that the man would do only a cursory scan and leave. Maybe, just maybe, he could sneak out as the mercenaries advanced deeper into the building.\n Thud, thud, thud, thud. The boots reached his desk. His chair, a nice leather office seat, launched across the room. It crashed, slamming into a row of filing cabinets. A vase shattered from the impact, china scattering against the blood crimson wool. Boas howled like a dog as a hand reached under his desk, grabbing him sharply by the collar. It hurled him against the wall, head slumped beneath a window sill. Vision swimming, he had enough time to see the armband the man was wearing. Four lightning bolts, cruciform. A futurist. \n Boas knew he was doomed. \n The jackboot smashed him in the stomach. Boas mewled, falling onto his side.\n “How does it feel?” the Frenchman snarled, “How does it feel to be wasted?” \nBoas couldn’t beg for his life. He didn’t have the breath. He stared up at the rifle clenched in the mercenary’s hand. The mercenary followed his gaze. “I’m not going to shoot you,” he laughed roughly, as his comrades finally stormed into the room. Boas hoped for one moment. “You deserve far worse.” Screaming became the world."

 ass.6.desc:0 "“You’re right,” Boas said at last, “We should consolidate our position first.” \nVespa softly released the breath he’d been holding. He stood in Boas’s office, hands folded neatly behind his back. Boas indicated the map that lay open on his desk. It was marked with pencil, countless lines and observances scrawled over it, scrubbed out and edited. Vespa stepped forward and leaned over, supporting himself with both hands. It was a nice, solid desk. Good, hard wood, the kind that wouldn’t be coming out of the Amazon for long. \n“The demarcation line,” Boas explained, tracing it out on the map, “Is the entire point of this exercise. Indigenous only land, our people aren’t allowed past it.” \n“But we still get the rubber money, right?” \nThere was a pause. \n“Boss?” \n“Some rubber will fall inside native land.” \nVespa swore under his breath. \n“Alright,” he said at last, “As long as we get enough.”"

 ass.7.desc:0 "“It’s absurd!” Vespa snapped, “We’re the ones sticking our necks out for him, and he undercuts the money flow.” \n“We’re still being paid the agreed amount,” Carl Gustav von Rosen commented, blonde hair neatly combed back. \n“Hardly the point,” Peter Flemming joined in, “We need those resources to keep defences running effectively, and keep morale up. How can we do our jobs if we’re cutting into our own pay to stay equipped.” \nThe three men were the centerpiece of the officer’s council that had been called. Thirty or so men, packed into one barracks house, sitting on ammo crates. The hut was filled with smoke that circulated about the ceiling before venting out through the cracks in the planking that made up the roof. It was stifling, and tempers were flaring. \n“Weapons for what?” Carl Gustav commented, “There hasn’t been any major fighting yet.” \n“Suppose one of the other factions invades us?” \n“Then,” Carl Gustav responded evenly, “It’s important that the natives like us, isn’t it?” \n“That they obey us,” Peter commented wryly, sucking back on his pipe. \n“Look,” Vespa exclaimed, voice coloured with frustration, “I’m concerned for our men’s safety. You can get the fuck out of here if you’re not going to help.” \nCarl Gustav looked annoyed for the first time, “The entire reason I’m here is to help people, I just don’t see how turning on our employer is going to do that.” \nVespa glared at him. “I get the picture,” Carl grimaced, “Fine.” \nHe got up. At the Swede’s motion, just under half of the officers made to follow him. Rifles slung, they trumped over to the exit. Booted feet pounded against hardwood floors. The front door swung open with a bang. \n“Where are you going?” Fleming asked, carefully. \nVon Rosen snorted, pausing at the door. \n“Away.” \nA brief moment of silence. Vespa and Fleming glanced at each other. \n“Is it time to move?” Fleming asked. \n“Yes, now or never.”"

 ass.8.t:0 "싸움의 끝"
 ass.8.desc:0 "Tracer fire buzzed through Macapa port. It whizzed up and down the streets, illuminating buildings in the half light that immediately preceded dawn. The rattle of machine guns played against the steady beat of rifles. In the distance, a brief flash and a rumbling, ground shaking roar heralded the fall of a mortar shell. The world turned red as a flare shot upwards, slowly drifting in the sky, an artificial, dying sun. \nVespa swore. \nSeizing the port had started well enough. His insurrectionist group had struck quickly and virtually without warning. It had taken a matter of minutes for the port itself to fall under their control, cutting off the four eyes from access to the sea. What he hadn’t anticipated was for Von Rosen to move so quickly. He should have killed him. \nHe ducked behind his crumbling cover as rounds slapped home around him, sounding for all the world like loudly snapping twigs. He and his remaining men were hunkered in the dockyard’s head office. The cacophonic roar of enemy fire, the sheer weight of it, kept them pinned. The situation was not good. It was only a matter of time before Von Rosen’s men arrived and flushed them out with grenades. \nPeter Fleming huddled next to him, white knuckles visible against the dark finish of his Enfield. Vespa tapped on the top of his helmet for attention. Fleming’s head snapped towards him, eyes glinting in the false-light of the flares. \n“We need to leave,” Vespa commented calmly. \nThere were a few launches at the rear of the building. They wouldn’t get them far, but they’d get them away. There was perhaps enough room for the twenty or so men that were left. Fleming nodded. It was better than dying. \nThey couldn’t run, so they crawled. \nRounds slapped and smashed their way through the wooden walls at the back of the building. They made their way to the exit behind the cover of sandbags, grunting and pulling forwards, hand over hand. Vespa forced himself up, sprinting from the building in the direction of the nearest launch. He froze as he saw the machine gun lined up and waiting for him. \nHe barely had time to swear before the force of impact toppled him backwards in the black waters below, and the tide carried him away. The crimson that flecked the seas was not simply the light of a new dawn."

Tracers illuminated the underbrush, casting the trees in unnatural hues of bright fluorescent greens and reds. 잎새들과 가지들 사이로 병사들은 서로를 향해 소리치고, voices lifted in savage adulation. \n\nThe curtain of leaves crashed apart as the jaguar rushed through it, running in blind panic. The whizz of close passing rounds formed a beat with the dry snap-snap of rounds hitting the ground. Dark smoke belched behind it as phosphor heat and tracers lit up the underbrush, choking the air with mixing acrid stench of burning chemicals and leaves. King of this jungle, the jaguar was not one to run from danger, not typically, but the group of men laughing and firing behind it was too much. They advanced, firing, without any real care for accuracy, absorbed in the magic of the noise. \n\nAccuracy wasn’t really necessary anyhow. The jaguar howled, snarling in pain as a round caught it, spinning it head over tail through the grass. Green fatigued mercenaries crashed through the bushes behind it, rifles up, mouths wide with excitement. Voracious, to outsiders, they appeared to swallow the world. The jaguar panted, fight or flight instincts stretched and sharp. It bared its teeth, growling. Unable to run, it did the next best thing, launching itself with what ounces of strength it had left to the nearest merc. He shouted, startled, bringing the bayonet mounted on his rifle to bear. He fell quickly into a ready position and simply allowed the cat to skewer itself. \n\nThe momentum carried him to the ground, and he lay, momentarily stunned under the weight of the beast. Its eyes reflected dull shock, glazing. The merc felt the creature’s blood seeping through the front of his tunic, warm and wet. He smelled the copper and felt the life seeping onto him. The forest fell silent. \n\nA pair of boots settled next to him, pounding amongst the dirt, moss, and dying leaves. A stream of ants, panicked by the vast object that had settled over them, scampered to one side to resume their endless march. The merc looked up.\n\n“Good instincts,” Peter Fleming commented, smiling down at him, “Let’s do that again.”"

In the bleak, dark half-night, crimson fires swept tree to tree, replacing that wholesome light with an angry, infected crimson. The sky itself seemed to burn. \n\nFleming watched it, impassive, pipe hanging from the corner of his mouth. The forest seemed to roar with pain, popping and crackling. Sparks leapt up, spraying the world with light and heat. The smell of burning wood overwhelmed everything, even the smells of the cooking flesh that must surely have been out there. Above, the planes swept back for another pass. Baleful and monstrous in the half light, they had a demonic aspect to them. Jagged teeth and narrowed eyes painted artfully onto them seemed to swim with the fire, warping between mirth and hatred.\n\nThey dumped the remainder of their incendiaries into the blaze below. The sound of the blast was lost in the forest’s death scream. Rushing over, propellers howling, one of the pilots dipped his wing. Fleming waved back lazily. He tracked them as they roared past to airfields. They would rearm, and fly out again to finish the job elsewhere.\n\nHe smirked. The flickering of the blaze cast shadows over his eyes.\n\nThere would be no more ambushes."

 ass.13.desc:0 "The air still felt cold as the sun was rising over the suburbs of London; Ian Lancaster Fleming was pleasantly surprised to find a letter and a sizeable package from his brother in the mailbox. After he had carried the box into his room, he started to unpack it, only to see various, seemingly random items inside it, made of wood, cloth and... rubber? As well as a little note saying: \"Read my letter first!\". Following this order, Ian cut open the envelope and started reading...\n\"Dear Ian, I must apologize for sending you such a delayed response to your letters, but it turns out that ruling over a territory is harder than anticipated... You probably want to know what the objects inside the package are supposed to be and what I have been up to, since we overthrew these despicable scientists and established ourselves in Rio Branco. Seeing that money is essential for securing our reign, we decided to exploit the Amazon ́s resources to fill our coffers; it might surprise you, but certain woods inside the rainforest can yield ludicrously high profits on the market; and we have already been trying to use this to our advantage. While the thick vegetation makes it difficult to cut down and transport trees efficiently, our loggers have found 2 solutions: Firstly, several workers have been equipped with flamethrowers, enabling them to burn away the smaller vegetation, while the larger and sturdier trees only receive minor external damage. Even though the method had proven itself quite effective, we had to assign supervisors to oversee the clearing. This is due to several soldiers growing fond of the idea of intentionally burning wild animals alive during their breaks and even working hours. While I personally do not really care, our logisticians aren't too happy about soldiers wasting fuel for their personal entertainment. And Secondly, although not being an easy task, we managed to construct improvised roads and clear rivers, which we can now use to transport our ever growing output of tropical timber. The newly acquired profit was used to hire more workers that have now been doing the hard work for us. We have already attracted several interested investors and the whole situation has turned more successful than expected. You never expected me to become a successful businessman, did you?  Now, the first item I have for you is wrapped in yellow paper, it ́s Mahogany wood, one of the most expensive kinds of timber, quite the luxury. Although I do not fully understand, why it is so valuable, I still decided to send you a piece...\"  Ian held the small block of mahogany wood in his hand, feeling its polished texture and the pattern, that reminded him of a jaguar. He put the block onto his desk, still fascinated by its origin, the remote jungle of Amazônia. He looked back at the package and the objects inside it, sat back down and continued reading the letter... "

Understandably, their officers were not amused by this and punished the soldiers who handed over the prisoners, thinking they would be rewarded for this behaviour. The remaining perpetrators were caught, when they proudly told others about their acts, inspiring them to do the same. The prisoners were transported to an outpost and encouraged to disclose useful information. Interestingly enough, one of the natives wasn't as barbaric as we thought, working as a miner before returning to his tribe, and suggested a deal with us: During his time as a miner he quite often illegally collected diamonds near a river, south of our base, for extra income. He is willing to show us the location, in return we must release all other captives and reward him with a considerable amount of money. Although hesitant at first, an armed expedition was authorized, including several soldiers and a geologist, who was all too happy not to be in the improvised prison for once. And sure enough, after arriving at the location and building an improvised water pump, the cleaned gravel contained small, transparent crystals. Diamonds. While some supported the idea of extorting the ex-miner, we did eventually fulfill our end of the bargain, after a commander urged us to, stating that it might encourage other Indios to help us, for their personal gain. A transport route was swiftly built and diamonds have already been extracted and sold to interested jewelers all around the world. I myself have a few on my desk, a truly fascinating material, and your package contains an exemplar as well, wrapped in several layers of white paper. I hope you like it, it wasn't easily acquired...\" Ian breathed on the crystal and its surface didn't mist up. A diamond. Whilst he trusted his brother not to send him a glass forgery, he still wanted to make sure that this, although unpolished, crystal was indeed the hardest material on earth..."

One proposal we have implemented is the settling of white Brazilians from our cities into the new countryside, offering them temporary tax cuts and a considerable amount of land for agriculture. We also built new infrastructure and shops for consumer goods, which could be used by the new inhabitants and also lead to the formation of new villages. This in turn again opened up new job opportunities that attracted additional immigrants; maintenance for infrastructure, housing offices, hospitals, etc. are all working as intended.

For the last 20 years several companies used Brazil to plant rubber trees and sell the harvest abroad, but during the collapse of the country most companies lost their, through the socialist government anyway highly regulated, plantations and investments, therefore many were now trying to find a replacement for their severe financial losses. It was an opportunity too good to miss, so a deal was struck with the infamous Ford corporation, which sought to make themselves independent from rubber companies and produce their own rubber. In a meeting we conducted, Ford officials introduced us to their plans, showing us the, to my surprise very interesting, methods of rubber manufacturing, including samples of the different stages through which the rubber would transition during production.After all important business agreements were made, all of us got an... interesting present: A white ball made out of rubber, that bounces back to you when thrown onto a hard surface. I am not quite sure what I am supposed to do with it or why they decided to gift us something that would be more fitting for a child. Perhaps to show us the quality of their rubber? Nonetheless, I decided to send the ball to you, maybe you can make use of it...”Ian threw the ball towards the wall... it bounced to the ground... he caught it in his hand... again... and again..."

While our loggers advanced more and more into the untouched debts of the amazon forest, the interactions with natives were becoming more hostile by the day. At the beginning it was very rare, but it eventually came to a point where it wasn't all too uncommon that about a dozen soldiers were in the hospital at a time, because of native attacks, one especially bold group even set fire to one of our fuel silos. Something needed to be done. All military commanders were summoned to a meeting and asked to provide solutions for the out-of-control native pest. While some of our commanders like Carl Gustav von Rosen were in favour of a more diplomatic approach, the proposal which was ultimately chosen was brought forward by a former RAF pilot, Frederic Ives Lord. He suggested the extermination of all natives in the larger area around our settlements, that way our soldiers would not have to fear any contact with them anymore. Seeing this as the most effective solution we gave our generals the nod to conduct such an operation. Several extermination squads were formed to deal with the problem and a few days later we received the first reports that several villages had been neutralized and their inhabitants no longer a threat. Not too long after the mission turned out to be a success, casualties were low and the pest was driven from our lands and it stayed like that for quite a while.The tools and primitive art pieces we found were sold to the British Museum in London, but I managed to keep one for myself and send it to you. If you want to see the rest, look out for the next special exhibition in a London Museum...\"A wooden figure made by an Amazonian native...

Their officer, worried, sent out a squad to investigate and what they found was horrifying. Silos burned, supplies stolen and outside the main building headless bodies, disemboweled, and their heads put on spikes. According to several of our strategists, this attack was coordinated and, judging by the lack of enemy corpses, well executed, nothing we had seen by anyone out here, yet. Even though their warriors have been very uncoordinated before, most generals agreed that it was most likely a native attack, pointing at a soldier which scalp had been removed, most likely taken as a trophy.The raids only became worse from this point on, killing or horribly injuring our soldiers and worker, even settlers and their families weren’t spared on some occasions. After a while our loggers refused to do their job and organized strikes, fearing they would be the victims of an Indio attack. Their superiors only managed to convince them after promising armed escorts, protecting them from potential danger. We weren’t able to maintain this for long however, since this occupied a large part of our forces thus preventing us from conducting any serious operations.Our military leadership was overwhelmed by the nature of these attacks, having little experience with guerilla tactics and losing more and more soldiers each day.

Their forces were highly adapted to the jungle terrain and through raids on our outposts, had even managed to equip some of their warriors with modern weapons. According to one native, captured soldiers were mostly spared at first, but after a prisoner had infected a village with measles, killing almost half of their population, the Indios executed all of them, a fate that they would now share with all other captives from that point on.Immediate actions were taken: Most regions were banned for loggers, only the nearest logging grounds were accessible with armed escorts, funding was increased for the AIA and their special forces program and any native was to be killed or captured for further interrogation.

You might be shocked, but I had a good reason to. During the coalition raids on our forces many soldiers and settlers had started to doubt my leadership capabilities and ability to protect them. Unfortunately, this sentiment was beginning to spread among several leaders of my government as well, so immediate action was necessary.

Our officer anticipated this to be quicker and secure, as he believed the natives would be too under-armed and not bold enough to stage an attack.\n\nA grave mistake.\nThe forces were in the middle of a river crossing, when natives armed with rifles engaged the soldiers which had already crossed the stream. I barely got to shore before they shot at the boats on the river, forcing the passengers into the water, just to be killed amongst the waves. Under attack, I and the others tried to hold out against the locally superior force of Indio warriors, while our comrades on the other side gave us the little fire support they could. Unfortunately, most heavy weaponry was either sunk or still on the other side, so only light and unconventional weapons were available. Looking back, I could see soldiers crawling out of the bloody mud water and grabbing the rifles off their fallen comrades, as the water had rendered theirs useless, and ahead, the men were fending off melee charges, appearing from the dense vegetation, some even embraced in a melee struggle, fighting with machetes against the attackers. Casualties and wailing on both sides, blood and terror all around, even I wasn't spared. A native managed to catch me off guard and scrape my temple with a club, knocking me to the ground, the soldier next to me set him on fire with their flamethrower, burning some of my hair in the process, another trooper cut the Indio ́s abdomen open with his machete, finally killing him, enabling me to get back into position. The tide finally turned, when a boat passenger managed to drag his Maxim machine gun out of the water and got it functional again. The resulting covering fire increased native casualties rapidly, eventually forcing them to retreat.The now calm battlefield was a disturbing sight, men, living and dead, were lying on the floor in their blood-drenched clothes, the water on the river bank was a mixture of blood and mud, and screams could be heard from thewounded or echoing from the jungle, some of them by abducted soldiers, who we might never see again.Forces on the other side of the river soon managed to reach us and tend to the wounded. I received a bandage around my head and an unfortunate new haircut, I included a picture for you. But unlike the other wounded, I did not get evacuated, I wanted to keep fighting with the others. A job had to be done...\"Bruised, tired and blood running down along the cheek, Ian looked at the photograph his brother sent him.
