 LEO_boniface_desc:0 "When paganry still stood strong in Europe, Christendom could not stand to wait idly by and let the reactionary faith of antiquary stand as a roadblock to the faithful, leading men like St. Boniface to go out and chop down their holy oaks, striking at the heart of paganism itself. Thus when Pope Benedictus XV passed from this life to the next in 1922 and the 60 men from the Sacred College of Cardinals met to decide who would succeed him, Pietro Gasparri, the previous Cardinal Secretary of State, was elected as Pope Bonifatius X. His ascendancy came at a fraught time, with the German revolution brewing at full might. It was under his tenure that a deal was struck between the Revolutionaries and the Holy See, recognition in exchange for the end of repression, and solidarity in the face of the Prussian devil Ludendorff.\n\nDuring his 12 year tenure, Bonifatius X struck again and again at the forces of reaction across Europe; many remember his scathing fury at Paris in 1924. Although he sadly passed in 1934, his successor Eugenio Pacelli, now known as Pope Ignatius, is a man of a similar temperament. With the See having been thrust into the worldly realm before, only time will tell if Bonifatius' axe will strike again."

 LEO_walls_desc:0 "In 846, Old St. Peter's Bascilica was sacked by Arab raiders. This hostile action sparked the Papacy into constructing a new set of fortifications on Vatican Hill, and in 852, the Leonine Walls finished construction, named after Pope Leo IV.\n\nAfter the Risorgimento swept across Italy in the 19th century, the Holy See was forced out of sovereignty and into prison, banished from the Papal States. Pope Pius IX refused to compromise with the nascent Kingdom of Italy, and for the next 51 years, the tensions between the See and Italy were fraught at best. This all changed with the ascendancy of Luigi Sturzo and his Partito Popolare Italiano, the first party for which the 'Non Expedit' boycott of the Italian elections imposed on Catholics was lifted. However it was only upon Sturzo's appointment as Prime Minister of Italy that the relationship between the realms of Pope and King finally began to be healed. Hence on January 6th, 1921, the Lateran Treaty was signed between Sturzo and Pope Benedictus XV, establishing an independent Leonine City State within the boundaries of St. Leo IV's walls, and with it, the Papacy was finally leased from its cell."
 POLITICS_IGNATIUS_DESC:0 "교황 이그나치오가 사제로서 서품을 받았던 어릴 시절, 그가 친구와 가족에게 나눠 준 서품상본에는 \"에우제니오 파첼리, 로마인\"이라는 문구만 적혀 있었습니다. 실로, 이그나치오를 설명하기에 더 없이 좋은 말이었습니다. Hailing from the so-called black nobility allied with the Holy See since time immemorial, 그의 가문은 이탈리아의 통일이 이루어지기 아주 오래 전부터 영원의 도시에서 은행가, 변호사, 사제로서 하느님의 대리인을 섬겨 왔습니다. The turbulent times that the Papacy went through after the war marked Pacelli deeply, especially the fierce rivalry between Church and state and the complex diplomatic ties that interconnected Europe like a spiderweb.\n\nEducated by the Jesuits, after whose founder he took his papal name (despite never being a member of the order), Pacelli's meteoric rise through Church hierarchy due to his talents as a canonist and energetic youth caught the eye of Cardinal Pietro Gasparri. Soon to be Pope Bonifatius X, the two became allies in the intricate Leonine politics, and Pacelli would even reach the highly coveted posts of Cardinal Secretary of State and Papal Camerlengo, essentially consecrating the duo as the true hands that held the reigns of the Catholic Church. Bonifatius X sent his trustee on numerous occasions to foreign countries as nuncio and legate, and to him the Catholic Church owes key diplomatic victories such as the concordats with Germany and Italy, the latter of which gave birth to the current Leonine City.\n\n보니파치오 10세의 영혼은 1934년 하느님의 곁으로 갔지만, 교회의 미래를 향한 의심은 없었습니다. The conclave and the Holy Spirit chose Pacelli as the next Archbishop of Rome, and it was natural they did so. The controversial but efficient meddling with worldly affairs was ultimately a success, and few complained beyond the most reactionary among traditionalists. His canonical stance was more moderate than Gasparri's reformism, appeasing more collaborative conservatives within the hierarchy.\n\nOnly two years later, world peace hinges on a precarious balance that is sure to be undone. The Pope must have eyes on the bellicose French and Germans, 불안한 이탈리아의 민주정, 폭력이 넘실대는 슬라브 국가들, 라틴 아메리카의 혼돈, and even face against against the Church's seemingly waning influence in the modern world. After an entire lifetime preparing for this very prospect, 로마인 이그나치오는 준비를 단단히 마쳐 두었습니다. 하느님의 종들 중 종이 되고자 한 건 양떼를 안전하게 지키고자 하였음이니, 설령 늑대떼를 죽이는 일이라고 해도 이그나치오는 마다하지 않을 것입니다."
