GUK_did_not_die:0 "우크라이나는 아직 소멸하지 않았다!"
GUK_did_not_die_desc:0 "After many years of hard labour in these inhuman conditions, we found a small glimmer of hope among the ice and taiga. We took it and spread it with the happy news - "Ukraine is alive!". The tragedy of Yellow Russia creates an epic piece about a new and young country that fights for its right to freedom and self-determination! We are going to fight for what is right, beautiful and true and we are not going to retreat. Our young republic needs many, but many efforts to survive, but our common will is enough to keep the glimmer of hope alive."
GUK_green_ukrainian_council:0 "녹우크라이나 인민평의회 수립"
GUK_green_ukrainian_council_desc:0 "We need a constitution! We cannot live in chaos! It is imperative to win the support of foreign countries and to establish our borders as soon as possible! Send messengers to Kiev and Warsaw! Get the best heads to write the first laws. Quickly before the Muscovites try to influence our land and make us quarrel. We need unity now, unity and unity again! We cannot allow our independence to be wrecked by feuds and quarrels at this historic moment!"
GUK_rally_partisans:0 "유격대 결집"
GUK_rally_partisans_desc:0 "One of our most valuable allies are the partisans of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Though some call them ordinary bandits, and we might doubt their loyalty to our Council, their fanatic dedication to the cause of Green Ukraine is admirable. Arise the sons of Green Ukraine! Fight for every yard of land!"
GUK_far_east_rada:0 "Dalekoskhidna Rada"
GUK_far_east_rada_desc:0 "We got in touch with our Far Western homeland and we managed to keep our borders. We also called representatives from all corners of the Far East. It brought positive results like the shouts of happiness through the reconciliation of families and meetings of former friends which caused tears of joy, but also showed what we are missing all this time - one stable course by which we will move. So far, two strongest parties have formed - ultranationalists and moderates. Grigory Fajda, the leader of the radicals, resorted to controversial methods of getting rid of Russians, Jews and Chinese. Myronovych and Borovyk has opposed the extremists and wants to maintain a tolerant republic. Despite the moment of unity, a time of conflict can be seen in the distance..."
GUK_president_myronovych:0 "미로노위치 재임"
GUK_president_myronovych_desc:0 "Repelling the vile attempt of a coup from the radical nationalists, the founding Congress of our Republic has proceeded uninterrupted. Dmytro Myronovych of the People's Revolutionary Party was elected the president of the young state – intending to bring socialism to the Far Eastern Ukrainians."
GUK_end_upa_bands:0 "End UPA Bands"
GUK_end_upa_bands_desc:0 "The treacherous strike from Fajda's thugs has proven that the UPA partisans are not to be relied upon. The Insurgent Army will be dissolved – and the loyal elements of the partisans will be integrated into a standing army. Instead of maintaining a band of rabid looters and rapists, Green Ukraine should have a real People's Army!"
GUK_soldiers_honor:0 "병사들의 명예"
GUK_soldiers_honor_desc:0 "In dark times like these, it pays to have the men with guns on your side, for a single bullet can do what a hundred thousand ballots cannot. Trained men are worth their weight in gold - and gold they shall receive."
GUK_one_green_stripe:0 "무지개 속 초록 줄 하나"
GUK_one_green_stripe_desc:0 "The rock upon which we build our nation is a world apart from our brothers on the Black Sea, and the myriad identities within our borders reflect that. But they need not fear the coming of our nation, as we owe our continued existence to not just the Ukrainians, but to the Russians, the Chinese, the Volga Germans, and many more besides. They stand with us, and we stand with them."
GUK_far_eastern_federation:0 "극동 연방"
GUK_far_eastern_federation_desc:0 "Green Ukraine is only the beginning – we are but one of the nations to create the new future for our land. No longer should one nation claim dominion over the others in the Far East – Ukrainians, Russians, Chinese and Jews will live in brotherly harmony, all united under the flag of our new, free federation!"
GUK_for_social_reform:0 "사회개혁을 위하여"
GUK_for_social_reform_desc:0 "Beneath the heaving corpse of the Russian Republic, a little help goes a long way. Many lost everything as Kerensky’s project collapsed — and to whom providing anything is a blessing."
GUK_congress_of_soviets:0 "평의회 대회의"
GUK_congress_of_soviets_desc:0 "Suffering under our recent ordeal, the people must work together or risk being swept away by the current. Formalizing a system of councils amongst our populace will allow for local coordination of economics and the maturing of our political system."
GUK_salo_socialism:0 "살로 사회주의"
GUK_salo_socialism_desc:0 "In our policy we should take an example from the so-called "소시지 사회주의" developed by German Social Democrats. The immediate needs of the workers shall take place over lofty ideals so that the common man of Green Ukraine has his belly full and his rest peaceful."
GUK_strike_from_upa:0 "UPA의 역습!"
GUK_strike_from_upa_desc:0 "The so-called Ukrainian Congress has already attempted to sell out the young embryo of our state to Jews and Moskals! The brave Insurgent Army of our Republic shall take the matters in their own hands – for the survival of the Ukrainian people in the Far East. All the socialists are to be purged away and all the unnecessary democratic institutions dissolved. Only the strong hand of Fajda can protect our nation and guide it through the storm of foreign powers!"
GUK_sweet_scent_of_revenge:0 "복수의 달콤한 향"
GUK_sweet_scent_of_revenge_desc:0 "Raise your heads Ukrainian brothers and sisters! Raise your fists and the axes you hold in them! We will go to battle against our oppressors, so show no mercy - no Russian child, woman or old man can stop us in our sacred task! Burn their churches! Burn their books! Burn their houses! Plunder and murder! Let these pathetic creatures regret being born Russians! Let the sweet scent of blood float in the air, which will remind us of the sweet scent of our revenge! Morning mists should turn red with their blood!"
GUK_no_more_moskals:0 "No More Wretched Moskals"
GUK_no_more_moskals_desc:0 "We will drive the Russians out first from the East and then we will drive them from the west! Our crusade will bring our fury on them and destroy them. The Triune Russia will be destroyed and scattered to three sides of the world, as will the bodies of these Russian peasants. Their hideous language will not be spoken on this earth. Their habits will no longer exist. Their religion will be exterminated. Nothing Russian will remain in the Far East, and we will see to it."
GUK_clean_yellow_peril:0 "황화 척결"
GUK_clean_yellow_peril_desc:0 "A great swath of our homeland is populated by its former natives – the Chinese, a meek race of bug-people that deserves nothing more than slavery in our new order, fitting their inherent servile nature. But, like every insect, the Chinaman grows in numbers at an immense rate. To prevent the drowning of our beautiful Ukrainian race in a flood of disgusting yellow animals steps need to be taken. Burn their nests! Exterminate their women! Do not let the white man in the Far East perish!"
GUK_pure_national_state:0 "순수하며 민족적인 국가"
GUK_pure_national_state_desc:0 "Within a radius of several hundred kilometers in our wonderful country you will not see any Russian or Jew. This is due to Fajda, who like a bomb hurled himself amongst between the enemies of Great Ukraine and destroyed them all. He guaranteed our prosperity and freedom. Green Ukraine became as clear as a tear - like the blue sky and golden ears of wheat in the field. We have never been so free since we were exiled from our homeland, but today we can all freely sing that our homeland did not die and will never die!"
GUK_our_place_in_sun:0 "태양 속 우리의 자리"
GUK_our_place_in_sun_desc:0 "The Russian ogres have banished us to the East in hope that, separated from our ancestral homeland we will lose our spirit and tongue, becoming like them. They couldn't be more mistaken! The plains of Manchuria remind us of our old beloved Cossack steppes, the forests here are just like in Galicia. The Far East has become a place in the sun for the Ukrainian nation – and now it belongs only to it. No foreigner shall taint the prize that is our new home!"
GUK_all_classes_one_flag:0 "한 깃발 아래 모든 계급들"
GUK_all_classes_one_flag_desc:0 "The Ukrainian people don't know such things as "socialism" and "capitalism" – both are foreign inventions devised to keep us down, respectively Russian and Jewish. Holding  both the cosmopolitan individualism of the capitalists, and the rootless internationalism of the socialists in disgust, we will fight for a new conception of society – one where all classes are united in the common struggle for national glory."
GUK_banderite_nation:0 "반데라파 민족"
GUK_banderite_nation_desc:0 "Our leader from the far west sent Fajda to guarantee the survival of the Ukrainian nation in the Far East! We did it. Although Russian dogs still bite each other and try to destroy our young country, we have managed to free themselves from their nasty ticks. Green Ukrainians, thanks to the ideals of Stepan Bandera, were able to persevere and build a functioning society in these harsh and hostile lands. Let our children praise Stepan Bandera and Grigora Fajda because without them we would not have a new Ukraine! 영광! 영광! 영광!"

#Events
GUK.1.t:0 "전쟁의 불길과 총격의 화염 속에서"
GUK.1.desc:0 "Dmytro Myronovych entered the temporary hall of the parliament of Green Ukraine. He stripped off his snow-covered cloak and glanced at the audience. Most were former Ukrainian activists, but slant-eyed faces appeared here and there. He was surprised, however, by the small number of more radical nationalist politicians from the OUN. He frowned, trying to guess why such a small number of nationalists showed up at the meeting. Trying to rationalize these shortcomings, he told himself that it was either in protest against the admission of Asians to the Rada or that they simply could not come due to the difficult weather conditions. Without hesitating any longer, he walked over to the podium and began to speak. \n\"Brothers and sisters of the Ukrainian people and of other nations who have helped us in our holy mission. I would like to congratulate everyone gathered here, because our joint effort allowed us to forge a new state on the ruins of Yellow Rus-\"  \nOUN representatives stood up to attention together and began to sing "March of Ukrainian Nationalists". Everyone in the crowd started whispering to each other and feeling embarrassed. Myronovych tried to continue the speech, but was drowned out by the nationalists. He rested his hands on the podium and rolled his eyes. He pierced the nationalists with his eyes and began to speak. \n\"Gentlemen, please stop interrupting me, start acting like the adults that yo-\"Again he was unable to finish his thoughts when the temporary parliament building shook and outside screams and shots were heard. It wasn't long before the building shook a second time. The concerned politicians and Myronovych himself began to look around what was the result of these strikes. The nationalists continued to sing their song in stoic peace. Eventually a group of soldiers ran into the room and the Captain began to speak, panting. \n\"They are attacking us!\" \n\"Who?\" Asked Myronovych but he did not receive the answer. The nationalists had pulled axes and knives out of their coats. The screams of other politicians who were attacked by them were quickly heard. One of them lunged at Dmytro, but thanks to his quick reaction, he pulled a revolver from his coat and shot the OUN member three times in the chest. The soldiers who entered the room quickly pacified the delinquents, but the fight was still fought outside. MEPs panicked and tried to flee the room. Myronovych saw that and he stood on the table and began to speak to them. \n\"We can't run away! These animals will try to kill us at all costs. To kill the freedom we fought for. Kolchak's rule is no different from that of this idiot Fajda. Therefore, we must stand together against injustice and fight it actively everywhere!\" \nAll the deputies stood still and understood that they could either fight or die. They stopped panicking, some started to clap, but almost everyone got a gun to fight Fajda's bandits. Together, like brothers and sisters, they fought for freedom and they..."

#LEADER BIOS

GUK_grigory_fajda_desc:0 "Grigory Fajda was born in the early months of the Great War, in a little village in Austro-Hungarian Galicia. He grew up in the same place, but in Piłsudski's Poland. He graduated from the academic gymnasium in Lwów (Lviv to patriots), and like a number of politically active Ukrainians who came of age there, his awakening nationalist consciousness brought him into the growing OUN. Specifically, he was an uncompromising irredentist in the model of the new generation of fighters inspired by Dmytro Donstov. Though the organization had to avoid being too disruptive to Ukraine's alliances to avoid a crackdown, Fajda soon developed a reputation for extremism that saw him christened "Bomba" by his compatriots.\n\nWhat started as taking part in belligerent - and occasionally violent - marches in the Polish fringe took on a darker pallor as time wore on. Before Petliura's fall from grace, the OUN grew increasingly uneasy about the would-be dictator's attempts to centralize power in Kyiv, especially given his unwillingness to fight Warsaw over territorial disputes. Shortly before the end, Fajda took part in a small terror attack on a Polish post office, which infamously ended in failure when the employees fought back with surprising aplomb. To save their skins in the diplomatic crisis that followed, the Bandera wing of the OUN sent Fajda and a number of other radicals on a voyage to the republican Far East - ostensibly for the purpose of organizing the locals against a hypothetical Russian invasion.\n\nLuck is a funny thing, and while nobody can directly link Fajda to the events that transpired, it was a radical from the Zheltorossiyan Ukrainians that blew up the generals of the abortive military junta. When Borovyk had to marshall all the resources available to him, it gave the OUN cell and its sympathizers a chance to behead the state and seize it for themselves. What would be the point of recreating a facsimile of that Moskal settler colony Zheltorossiya when Ukraine itself had proven the need for a strong national state? And so the Bomb sets to work on sharpening the Green Wedge into a knife, one that will be ready to plunge into Russia's back when the motherland calls."
GUK_dmytro_myronovych_desc:0 "Dmytro Myronovych Borovyk ended up in the Russian Far East, but was born in 1876 on a farm in the southwest of Ukraine. One year later, his father left for war against the Ottomans and returned blind. Nevertheless, he was able to teach the young Dmytro literacy, starting him down the path to graduating from school in Odesa. Afterward, while studying in the agronomic department at Riga Polytechnic, he came into contact with other educated countrymen who welcomed him into the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party. Though he would graduate from university in Odesa in 1906, he was almost immediately arrested for involvement in nationalist agitation. After one year of solitary confinement, Borovyk served out a five year sentence of exile in Siberia, where he worked at a meteorological station in the far north. Despite nearly dying along the way - and being allowed to work in a less remote station as a mercy - he would finish his sentence having improved his studies and gotten into contact with local Ukrainian organizations.\n\nIn the end, developments in exile foreshadowed the next decades of Borovyk's life. After working in Riga and Petrograd academia, he was transferred to Vladivostok during the Great War to work as a physicist at yet another meteorological station. Throwing himself into the local Ukrainian community, he became a founder of the local nationalist club Prosvita (among others) and the editor and publisher of the first Ukrainian-language newspaper in the region. Through the first winters after the civil war would almost kill him, Dmytro remained a fixture in the local Ukrainian nationalist congresses, though an understanding with Kerensky's TNSP in the face of the Empire kept them from pushing for independence as they originally planned.\n\nNow, with both Kerensky and Zheltorossiya gone, the Ukrainian minority of Zheltorossiya is using the organizations that bound it together to organize and arm for their own protection. Emerging as a consensus candidate, Borovyk has finally come in from the cold to direct the Green Wedge in a way that would be familiar to his old RUP comrades. Can this man lead a Ukrainian state that will withstand the tests ahead, even a continent away from Kyiv?"
