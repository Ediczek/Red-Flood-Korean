#LEADERS#
POLITICS_RAZAF_I_DESC:0 "워싱턴 DC에서 태어난 (친구들에겐 앤디 라자프로 알려진) 안드리아마난테나 폴 라자프케리에포는 산산조각난 고국에서 자라났습니다. The death of his father Henri after his family was forced to leave Madagascar meant that he was raised by his teen mother Jennie and her father John L. Waller. Andy was raised hearing miraculous stories about his father's royal life in Madagascar and his grandfather's expedition, although he never thought of or even hoped to reclaim a spot among the court. Rather, young Razaf's focus was always turned towards making music, for he had a talent in verse and lyrics. Eventually, he moved to Tin Pan Alley in 1913 to purse a career in the business, slowly builing up his repertoire while working a day job as an elevator operator. But in 1918 he took a page out of his grandfather's book, entering into radical Negro circles like the UNIA-ACL. Razaf continued on like this, with a prominent musical future ahead of him as his life's goal. That was until a very fateful day in 1918; while reading a newspaper, Razaf noticed a small story about a rebellion Madagascar, remembering the whimsical tales from his youth. Reading further into the story however, he would find that the rebels were calling for a King, and in a moment that would change his entire life, Razaf realized it could be him. \n\nWhile he had never wanted power, Razaf desperately wanted to see his Negro brothers united as one, against imperialism and injustice. He realized that he would be the best candidate to bring that freedom to Madagascar, the true sense of liberty that could serve as an example to Negroes worldwide. He brought up his heritage to his friends in the UNIA, and soon even Marcus Garvey heard the tale of this Tin Pan Alley Prince, and begun mobilized UNIA to press the claim. With their political connections, by the time the treaty of Harlem was being signed between the Sadiavahe rebels and the new French Action Française regime, Razaf was at the top of the list. So with a stroke of a pen, Andy Razaf of Tin Pan Alley became a King, as Razaf I. \n\nYet his royal tenure was not as smooth as he expected, as his Malagasy was rusty at best, and his French nonexistant. However Andy Razaf is not a man to give up easily, and although this civil war presents itself as a roadblock, there is nothing more alluring than the beautiful sound of freedom, and King Razaf I will not stop fighting until his people are free."

mag_jazz_kings_new_swing:0 "재즈 왕의 새 스윙"
mag_jazz_kings_new_swing_desc:0 "\"How would it end? Ain't got a friend \nMy only sin is in my skin \nWhat did I do to be so black and blue?\" \n\nThe smooth, sultry sounds of Madagascar's vibrant new king flow over the island, washing it in a symbolic baptism into the new Modernist era. With Razaf has come a wave of technological and sociopolitical rejuvenation and revitalization, breathing life into the ancient monarchy and Malagasy culture as a whole. As such, the king himself is seen as a physical manifestation of the forward momentum that Madagascar, barreling onwards, is propelled by, both to the joy of those who embrace the future, and to the chagrin of those who hold Malagasy traditions tightly in their hearts. But for now, the cries of reaction are drowned out in the sultry, sweet sounds of jazz flowing from the Rova of Antananarivo, with no sign of the Malagasy Renaissance stopping anytime soon."

However, the biggest and by far most prominent ingredient in this new cocktail is the inspiration drawn from the Japanese Empire, reshaping Madagascar in the image of Nihon. The Meiji constitution is a prime model for us to base our state off, and the Japanese success in both economic and foreign matters proves that their system is one we should strive to replicate. Thus as Japan is the sun rising over Asia, so too will Madagascar cast her rays across Africa, shining brightly forevermore and lighting up the world with our iridescent glory."
mag_footprint_of_colonials:0 "식민가들의 발자국"
mag_footprint_of_colonials_desc:0 "While Madagascar has overthrown the imperialist boot placed on her neck, she has not yet removed its footprint. Foreign missions, spreading their strange forms of Christianity, beg loyalty to Rome and Europe. Their languages too, leave an impression on our people, giving us a rather unique issue in how to speak to our own countrymen. There even exist some remnants of European outposts, in the form of the Polish Maritime and Colonial League, as well as French-populated cities. The issue of what to do with these white devils and their snake oil is hotly debated in Antananarivo, with some suggesting full expulsion of all foreign elements, even the American Negro. Yet for now, the footprint of colonialism remains, as a reminder of Madagascar's past, and a warning of what her future may become."

Yet our suspicion is not yet erased, for as the proverb goes; \"Beware of French people who pretend to quarrel with each other: they will join together to fight you.\" So for now we shall keep them at arm's length, and although our relationship is better under the Artaud regime than it was before, there is still a long way to go before they regain our trust, if at all."

mag.1.desc:0 "앤디 라자프는 had never quite gotten used to these royal speeches, with thousands of people cheering for him. Even after the civil war had begun, people still flocked in droves to see their king speak. It was an experience you don't easily adjust to after a life of poverty and making lyrics in his flat, but at least he knew how to write his own speeches. Yet His Royal Majesty Razaf I had his duties and obligations, those which he must fulfill for people. Besides, today was a special day, with a very special announcement. \n\n\"My beautiful brothers and sisters!\" Razaf's voice whipped the crowd into a frenzy, years of singing giving him a melodic timbre. \"Today is a most holy day. For it is today that, after our Lord Zahanary's son and Messiah Jesus Christ was sent down to this Earth, He was visited by three kings! Our Lord God's Son was blessed by those very kings, and given incredible gifts to celebrate His coming!\" The crowd was hanging on his every word, wondering where this speech would go. \n\n\"So it is today that I, your king, come to you with three blessings! You, the chosen sons and daughters of our Lord the Creator of the Universe, who sent his son Yeshua to bless his chosen people! We, the sons and daughters of Moses, of Abraham, of Israel! I bring to you the blessing of peace, for that this terrible war will end soon, and the imperialist heathen usurpers shall meet their Satanic masters in Hell!\" \n\nThe crowd erupted in praise, ecstatic at this news, putting a smile on Razaf's face. \"Secondly my brothers and sisters, I bring to you the blessing of love, so that all Negroes of our beautiful island find harmony together!\" The crowd's cheers continued, although at a somewhat lower intensity. \"God has blessed all of His chosen, so let all his Negroes come together in love this blessed day!\" \n\n\"And thirdly, my people, I bring to you the blessing of this very island! Madagascar is a sacred place, God's holy land for His chosen people! Look at the curse that befalls those who go against her, the crumbling of the French Republic! Now that the French have come back to help those they harmed, the island's curse on them has been lifted, and their nation is strong once again!\" \n\nThe crowd's cheers were a bit confused, but enthusiastic, but Razaf was sure this declaration would be seen as the diplomatic masterstroke it was by his people. To tie it all together, he said, \"Now, my people, it is time. These blessings I have brought upon you mean nothing alone, but through the power of prayer to YHWH our Creator, they shall be fulfilled! 기도합시다.\""

#MINISTERS#
MAG_jean_joseph_rabearivelo_hog:0 "장-조제프 라베아리벨로"
MAG_jean_joseph_rabearivelo_hog_desc:0 "장-조제프 라베아리벨로는 자신의 꿈을 살아 있도록 하려 싸우는 고통 받는 사내입니다. The Poet-Minister lives in an ever-increasing isolation, forced to be a scapegoat for the aristocracy's mistakes, and the passing days seem darker and darker in Madagascar. \n\nAs was proper of an aristocrat, Rabearivelo passed through official French schools and received the finest education according to his class. Although once he delighted in flirting with the avant-garde and wrote westernized surrealist pieces, his art took a turn for a decidedly anti-European and anti-assimilationist message, reclaiming traditional Malagasy language and symbols as banner in the struggle against French authorities. Yet this nationalism did not come from his colleague's leftist beliefs, but from the extensive influence of the ultra-monarchist Action Française, which alienated him from the socialist underground. Rabearivelo, denied of his prerogatives and fame as a nobleman by France and yearning for his rightful place in the social pyramid, enthusiastically agreed with Charles Maurras's calls to return to the right of blood and the iron law of tradition. When Georges Bernanos became the French President, he sought to give the Malagasy self-government under French tutelage, and Jean-Joseph's curriculum and ties to Action Française made him a natural choice to collaborate with the mainland. This, unfortunately, drew the wrath of the anti-colonialist movement, and he became the epicentre of their hatred. His reputation as a writer was destroyed by his involvement in politics, and successive scandals over his frugal lifestyle seemed to never end. \n\nTen years have passed since then, and Rabearivelo is, by misfortune or miracle, Prime Minister of the island. Exhausted and abandoned by his fellow nobles, Jean-Joseph is locked in a struggle to contain the King's modernist convulsions, the fantasies of pan-negrism and liberalizing influences from his natal America which the traditionalist poet hates. The dream of a free Malagasy monarchy has become a nightmare of isolation and inhuman effort for Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, one which he is not waking up from anytime soon."
MAG_jacques_rabemananjara_for:0 "자크 라베마난야라"
MAG_jacques_rabemananjara_for_desc:0 "자크 라베마난야라 수많은 책무를 등에 이고 있습니다. First, a patriot and loyal servant to His Royal Highness, Razaf I and the people of Madagascar, and second, to his craft, the penmanship of poetry and plays. \n\nBorn on June 23, 1913 in Maroantsetra in the eastern part of Madagascar, Rabemananjara spent his early life refining his talent of wit and writing, eventually merging it with the political. His plays in the spirit of "Négritude" were appreciated among Western intellectual circles, something he had in common with his  close friend  Prime Minister Rabearivelo. \n\nYet Rabemananjara's limelight came due to his great expertise on the monarchy of Madagascar, when in 1935, after years of civil war in Madagascar and longer support for King Razaf, he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs. As the newfound minister, he aims primarily to create a unity between black people across the world, for Madagascar in his vision is not to be just another puzzle, but an active leader of black emancipation. The unconventional policy of the rule of King Razaf and Prime Minister Rabearivelo also left a mark on the ideas of Jacques, who in his doctrine combines classical French Integralism with the Modernist hope of black people. Now, his hopes for a better tomorrow are high, and he is firmly convinced that Madagascar under Razaf's rule and his advice will become a kingdom in which black people will be free from all shackles."
MAG_samuel_rakotondrabe_eco:0 "사뮈엘 라코톤드라베"
MAG_samuel_rakotondrabe_eco_desc:0 "사뮈엘 라코톤드라베는 is known across Madagascar as a very successful entrepreneur, nationalist and loyalist of the king, as well as for his criticisms of the the "authoritarian and reactionary" economic system of Action Française. Born in 1901 as a witness of French rule in the Island, Rakotondrabe saw and experienced great injustices and atrocities on the part of the French colonizers, leading him to become a fervent supporter of King Razaf and the nationalists by providing them with financial aid. Yet while Rabearivelo attempts to combine UNIA modernism with AF Integralism, Rakotondrabe chose a different path. \n\nDespite remembering the good times under the rule of Action Française, in his opinion, Integralism supports an antiquated neo-feudal economic system that restricts individual freedom and rights.  Instead, he has grabbed the kingdom's reigns and began steering it in the direction of "Black Capitalism," known to the islanders as "Kapitalisma Mainty." By combining economic nationalism and market freedom, Rakotondrabe intends to improve the well-being of the people of Madagascar, and to serve as a shining example to the Negro world. \n\nSadly Rakotondrabe's system could not function at full effectiveness under the conditions of the civil war, but he still harbors hopes that in the long run his plan to free the Malagasy people from chains of international White capitalism will prove to be effective and crucial to building a new Empire, and maybe even a new model for the world."

MAG_ravelojaona_sec_desc:0 "국왕 라자프의 내각에 들어찬 인물들 가운데 라벨로야오나는 by far the most unorthodox. 그에게 명성을 안겨 준 건, 메리나 귀족의 후손이자 트라노조조로 교회 소속 개신교 목사라는, 그의 영성과 혈통이 아니었습니다. No, that would be his work in the creation of the first nationalist organization in Madagascar after the Menalamba rebellion spurred on by the deposed monarchy against the French, the creation of the original Vy Vato Sakelika secret society. \n\nRavelojaona, his heart burning for a question to solve the issue of the Malagasy people's oppression, saw his answer in Meiji Japan, and thus begin work on a series of articles titled "Japan and the Japanese," in which he praised the blending of modernity and tradition in the Meiji era. He saw Japan as a role model and and inspiration, and although he served in the French army during the Great War, Ravelojaona never forgot about Madagascar and Japan. As soon as he returned, he set out work expanding VVS further and further, even whilst the French kept trying to crack down and destroy him, until his efforts would reach a fever peak in 1920. \n\nThe appointment of a new Malagasy king was beautiful news to Ravelojaona's ears, and the fact he was appointed as Minister of Interior was nothing but sheer joy. Quickly he began work to spread the Protestant faith across Madagascar, whilst aping Japan's reforms in a way to spur on the Malagasy renaissance. He envisioned Madagascar as the Japan of Africa, a vision he eventually was able to convince even the King of, although Ravelojaona had no particular interest in the great Negro crusade. Yet still he continues onward, working tirelessly to make sure that Madagascar shines the brightest out of all the rising suns, to reach her peak in the Heavens and take her rightful place as a divine island blessed by God himself."
MAG_gabriel_ramanantsoa_int:0 "가브리엘 라마난초아"
MAG_gabriel_ramanantsoa_int_desc:0 "Gabriel Ramanantsoa is a man akin to Peter, a firm rock on which the Malagasy Kingdom is built upon, and just like Peter his faith is unshakeable. A Malagasy nationalist to his core, Ramanantsoa joined the newly founded Malagasy military soon after graduating from the Special Military School of Saint-Cyr, quickly rising up the ranks. His steadfast and conservative attitude seemed as if they would be a roadblock for his career under such a modernizing King, yet it was this very attitude that found him making friends with all sorts of people in the ruling government. His hardline stance against the French marked him as a firebrand, but after 1929 he seemed like just the man for the job. \n\nNow, Ramanantsoa serves as the sword and shield of the Kingdom, defending it from both threats internal and external. Yet his conservative attitude has not softened during his time in government, if anything, it has hardened like a stone. Ramanantsoa's disgust for anything French is well known, and his constant clamoring for full Malagasification of the island spark frequent debates and arguments from all sides of the Senate. For now though, he is busy saving his nation from ruin, placated with safeguarding the Malagasy people. To him, he is their rock, their foundation, and their savior."
