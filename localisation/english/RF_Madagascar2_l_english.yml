 POLITICS_CCRM_DESC:0 "For an observer, the Malagasy Revolutionary Command Council or the Conseil de Commandement Révolutionnaire in the language of many Malagasy revolutionaries is simply a pragmatic and temporary measure, intent on keeping the wide and unruly ideological grounds of the Republic together as long as time allows. \n\nFor Razaf and men loyal to him, it is the bickering face of republican terror: the colonist, draconian sleeve of french fanaticism, brutally forcing foreign faith, foreign morality and foreign ideas on the negroes by way of the bullet and intimidation. The marxist demons who keep its rotten body together act in a way that destroys and corrupts black emancipation, so what wrong is in responding to their evils with violence? \n\nYet for the Republic's sons and daughters, this council means far more than either of these answers: It is both the flame that burns away hundreds of years of colonialism to make way for a truly free and democratic Madagascar, and the intellectual powerhouse holding the torch of liberty that spreads it. The sword which ends the tyrant king's bloody reign over this island, as well as the plough that allows enduring men to grow seeds of freedom on its bloodied soil. \n\nFounded and jointly run by many of Madagascar's leading minds and independence activists such as Jean Ralaimongo, Joseph Raseta, Joseph Ravoahangy-Andrianavalona, and Paul Dussac, it has stood united for the Malagasy Republic since its founding, leading the fight towards an end to oppression and against the royal taint which it created. Shall this revolutionary alliance succeed or not, it has already created an entry in the minds of its enemies - One that will certainly take years to die out. "

 mlg_republican_to_our_bones_desc:0 "From the moment our movement was created, we have been nothing but Republican. From the VVS to the MRDM, we have continued the proud Jacobin tradition in the same footsteps as our ideological forefathers from France. Our cultural, linguistic, and religious ties to them helped the political flow as well, fully allowing republicanism to take root in Malgache society. This is no accident either, as the  Republic of L'Hexagone actively worked to spread the revolutionary ethos among our people, a gift we accepted with open arms. We of the C.C.R.M. are the modern day Montagnards, and the blood we have spilt for our newfound republic runs brightly blue, white, and red, for the Malgache people cannot and will not be truly free until there is no man above another, and the people reign supreme over all."
 mlg_broad_popular_front:0 "The Broad Popular Front"
 mlg_broad_popular_front_desc:0 "While our movement may be united under banner, this does not mean our thoughts are homogeneous, and often the ideologies our men fight for are as diverse the very men themselves. For despite there being no hint of monarchism at all, the broad-tent nature of republicanism has allowed us to absorb a huge amount of seemingly conflicting ideologies inside one tent, yet this exact strength is also a weakness. Thus, although we may hold the reigns, this does not prevent the horses from chomping at the bit, and ideological infighting happens both on the frontlines and in the halls of power. The unified cause that binds us in our crusade against the heretical monarchy is enough to prop the tent up for now, but after our inevitable victory, only time will tell whether our republic will be able to keep her fraternal values."

 mlg_pallbearers_of_prrrs_desc:0 "The Parti Républicain, Radical et Radical-Socialiste, or PRRRS, was in many ways the most important catalyst to our revolution. After coming to power in 1928, their attempt at reversing the actions undertaken by the Action Française government earned them a large amount of ire from False King Razaf and his farcical regime. Given their stance on Malagacy chauvinism, it is no surprise that the PRRRS' stance of socialist paternalism would drive them away, yet to us, it was a golden opportunity. Thus, our beautiful relationship would begin to blossom, with them funding and sending us guns, and we helping to tie together the French and Catholic communities into Republican causes, with the end goal being the complete incorperation of Madagascar into France as an equal member, just as fully French as the mainland. Yet sadly this was not to last, as their overthrow in 1934 meant a complete end to our love, and now we carry their legacy as a wilted flower, the last upholders of the true French government."
 mlg_our_personal_babel:0 "우리만의 바벨 탑"
 mlg_our_personal_babel_desc:0 "\"Salama rahalahy!\" one revolutionary says, and \"Salut, frère!\" answers another. This example demonstrates the fundamental issue among our forces: our nation is officially bilingual, but our men are not. This has lead to a comedy of errors, as our troops from the coast and other tribes tend to resent the forcing of a standardized Malagasy on them, but there are those who reject the French language as a body rejects a foreign disease. Our forces cannot fight at full capacity, nor can our government administer or educate effectively, at least until we have presented a solution towards the language issue in some form or another. For no matter what reforms we end up taking, surely anything is better than the anarchy of language we suffer under today, both in safeguarding the revolution of the people and a future for Malgache children."

 mlg.1.desc:0 "The elderly priest's melodic voice wrestled with the current of the Mania River, struggling to see which would be heard the loudest in that distant spot in the jungle. At the feet of the man of God, a squadron knelt in the orange mud of the river, some holding rosaries and others clutching their palms tightly in prayer. These soldiers, crestfallen and silent, were mere spectators in the cosmic struggle between the chaplain and nature to dominate their ears on the Feast of the Epiphany. While much of the regiment was Catholic (in their folkloric and idiosyncratic way), among the trees one could make out figures smoking and laughing in whispers, men who had refused to participate in the mass. No doubt they were followers of Dussac or perhaps of Ranaivo, men whose only faith rested in the workers and who despised, disappointed and amused, the religious fervour of their comrades. \n\nThe priest's weapons to make himself heard consisted in declaiming his speech in a chimerical mixture of Latin, French, and Malagasy, in an effort to make both the Francophone urbanites and the country men who knew only their local language pay attention to the celebration of the holy rite. Of course, the chaplain would not be among these military men if he were not himself as Republican as they were. Unorthodoxly, every turn of phrase was followed by a resounding insult to the king or a brutal attack on \"that pig\" Rabearivelo. Among the crimes that the improvised ecclesiastical tribunal accused the monarchy of were child-robbing, slavery, heresy, being foreigners, enemies of the people, and so many other charges that most of the attendees had already lost count. \n\nThe priest, exhausted by his struggle against the howls of the Mania River but not yet defeated, mustered all his voice and turned to bless the soldiers. In a wide arc he traced the sign of the cross. \n\n\"Under this sign you shall conquer, my sons!\" cried the old man, practically shouting. \n\nHe went to the table he used as an altar in this little mass, picked up a bowl, and after dipping his arthritic fingers in holy water, consecrated the heads of the soldiers. From his lungs roared a voice more powerful than that of the miserable river, subduing the jungle to the priest's sacred call. He did not, however, cry to God. It was not a religious hymn, but it was a hymn that the regiment knew all too well. With one voice, a song thundered down the Mania River."

 MLG_jean_ralaimongo_hog_desc:0 "Jean Ralaimongo's role as the Republic's chief architect was not a matter of circumstance, rather than a lifelong fate. Born in 1885 to a pastor spreading the word of God on the island, he had enough time to experience strife as soon as he learned to walk. It was during Ralaimongo's time as a boy when the Franco-Hova wars still raged, when his people were triumphed over by French rifles and cannons, when the monarchy was pushed out in favor of the protectorate which was in turn transformed into a full fledged colony a few years later. \n\nWhere many of his peers saw resentment towards their new masters, Ralaimongo noticed opportunity: the French opened a completely new world to the malagasy, one where the aristocracy was replaced by peoples will. Wanting to make a change himself, he quickly took the opportunity to be hired as a servant to a French urban family in exchange for education which would later allow him to become a teacher in Madagascar.  \n\nThat was not meant to be, however, as the Great War began and Ralaimongo, seeking to prove himself equal to a Frenchman, joined the western front alongside other Malagasy volunteers. It was France's humiliating withdrawal that urged him to return back to his home country and begin gathering supporters in hopes of convincing Paris to grant the Island a chance at integration into its political system. \n\nAs France's unstable political system underwent changes from madmen the likes of Maurras or Artaud all trying to claim the mantle while UNIA slowly pushed for one of their own as the king, Ralaimongo's opinion quickly turned from distaste to resentment. Giving up any hope of reconciliation between the two nations, he founded the MRDM as a revolutionary organization. And from that point the road towards a Malagasy Republic was made clear."

 MLG_paul_dussac_for_desc:0 "The spirit of the Paris Commune burns fiery in the heart of Paul Léon Alfred Dussac, and as Foreign Minister he is determined to become the country's voice, letting the foreign imperialists know the island will not submit to their designs. \n\nPaul Dussac had been a well-known face in radical Malagasy politics despite his white race, with extensive contacts to the republican opposition as he, along Jean Ralaimongo, founded the newspaper \"L'Opinion\", a ruthless political tool against the monarchy and the aristocracy. Dussac has the distinction of kick-starting the Malagasy Revolution in 1929 using this very same newspaper, as while the Razaf regime was struggling to keep afloat because of France's new assimilationist policy, the Marat of Madagascar made astounding accusations in his journal. L'Opinion read that the aristocracy, in cahoots with the government, had been abducting young children from rural areas to work as slaves in their plantations. Although the regime immediately cried that the articles were little more than propaganda, Dussac's accusations firmly resisted these rebuttals, and the massive fallout from these articles was the last nail in the coffin for the Malagasy Crown. The Republican revolution soon followed. \n\nNow an older man, his youthful and populist approach hasn't faded one bit, becoming a distinguished voice in the republican government for the years the civil war has been raging on. Paul Dussac is, without a doubt, one of the pillars of our movement and the father of a new Madagascar, and for that we are grateful."

 MLG_joseph_raseta_eco_desc:0 "The Doctor Joseph-Delphin Raseta is a meticulous and iron-willed man, devoted to the ancient principles of his profession. The Minister is determined by his study of medicine and careful consideration of the principles of socialism to be Madagascar's surgeon, so that with a firm hand he might remove the rot and gangrene from the island before it's slowly consumed by it. \n\nRaseta had always been an activist, and even while he was doing medical practice, he joined the radical anti-colonial group Vy Vato Sakelika, a trade union composed of nurses and doctors like himself. Collaborating with Dussac and Ramailongo in their newspaper \"L'Opinion\" since its inception, Raseta went in and out of prison in increased frequencies throughout the years. Fierce protests against the French authorities' land removals, calls to medical strikes, organizing rallies, and being the newspaper's treasurer gave him much valued experience and hardened the man into a determined political animal. Medicine once again was a decisive factor in his political life, as he came to know of Europe's dabbling with Marxism through the Internationale Red Aid's presence in the island and their campaigns to liberate anti-colonialist protestors from the royal dungeons. Raseta became well acquainted with the Second Internationale's version of the Red Cross throughout the years. Although no lofty intellectual, he co-founded the Parti Communiste de Madagascar with Jules Ranaivo, as he provided the political experience and the latter the socialist theory, imported from Germany and Hungary. When the Revolution began, Raseta's close ties with Dussac and Ramailongo gave him a place in government, and thus enshrined the PCM as a keystone of the Republican movement. Since then, Joseph Raseta's efforts to nationalize and collectivize everything the rebels have managed to hold on to has been tireless, and the advancement of the social revolution in Madagascar owes it all to the good doctor.

 MLG_joseph_ravoahangy_sec_desc:0 "Born from Merina nobility, Joseph Ravoahangy-Andrianavalona is one of the most dedicated supporters of the Malagasy national movement. A veteran of the island's revolutionary socialism, he participated in the creation of its oldest trade union and served many sentences under the colonial rule, becoming a character of renown and authority among the burgeoning independence movement. This respect of his comrades, along with his distaste for factionalism and generally moderate beliefs brought him to the position of one of the key figures in the new government. \n\nDisappointed with what he saw as the chauvinist and reactionary attitude of the newly declared Kingdom, Ravoahangy held onto his vision of a free, socialist and democratic Madagascar, its people united with the vanguard of global socialism. Thus he became one of the founders of the Republic, seeing taking up arms against a tyrant not as an act of treason, but utmost patriotism.  \n\nServing as a minister, Ravoahangy's policies seek a compromise between many of the factions of the Malagasy revolutionaries. While he hesitates from supporting any single tendency, Ravoahangy believes that only unity among the Malagasy people can bring about a new free and equal Madagascar – divisions only serve the interests of imperialists and oppressive dictators."

The impoverished peasants and enslaved farmers of the old regime of Madagascar have found a new Gracchus in the form of a tribal young man. \n\nHis blood carries the arid sands of the southernmost of the island, from which he departed at a young age to train as a Lutheran pastor. The spirit of piety and love for the poor that inflated his religious fervour animated too his activism for the poorest of of the poor of the island, the men and women who were being driven away by French colonialists who wished to install their own refineries and plantations in what used to be their land. When the very same Kings returned, however, it seemed that the peasant’s luck would not change so easily. The aristocracy enjoyed prerogatives they lacked even in the old system, and Razaf’s attempts to reform the land division were too little too late. After organizing the rural villages into self-defence units and forming trade unions to protect their interests against the nobility and the Europeans alike, Jean Ralaimongo’s underground resistance soon took notice of the young man’s efforts. In the Republican movement, Jaona found many like-minded folks who wanted radical agrarian reform, and so agreed to join the great platform as representative of the rural class’s political and social interests. \n\nNow, with a Revolution raging on for almost a decade, Monja Jaona’s popularity with the peasants and his stern defence of their lands has found him a position as the maximum arbiter of internal peace in the new Republic. Liberated peasant militias chant his name in praise, as their liberator and protector is so fundamental to the country’s war against the monarchy one could not imagine the war raging on without him."
