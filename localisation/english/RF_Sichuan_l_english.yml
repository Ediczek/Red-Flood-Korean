 POLITICS_QI_DESC:0 "Zeng Qi is the main writer and thinker behind the Young China Party, his career in politics has taken off since the failure of the Guomindang in 1928, which has allowed him and the YCP to solidify a base of support among many student groups and nationalists in the Central and Northern Provinces. He and his allies Li Huang and Zuo Shunsheng have broken into the political scene of Sichuan in particular since the demise of Jiǎng Jièshí and the disgrace of his Clique. Qi's writings and speeches have become foundational to the third way movement. Casting off the failures of the Guomindang and the stagnant Beiyang Government. Qi's YCP seeks a radical nationalist solution to China's period of humiliation, born out of the same European student groups who went on to form the Communist Party, the YCP reacted to their desire for class warfare and internationalism with horror. In reaction they created a new Nationalist Revolution, borrowing ideas from Polish, Turkish, Italian and Spanish Nationalists; the way of the Waking Lion is Qi and Huang's treatise to China."
 POLITICS_HUANG_DESC:0 "Li Huang is the other side of the YCP coin to Zeng Qi. Also a prominent thinker and writer, his views skew closer to an esoteric democracy with state-devotion as a kind of civic religion. The idea presents a democracy where the best interests of the nation are regarded highest priority by the people, thus a river flow of support for the best leaders will follow. In parctise Huang's views have had little practical implementation, the situation in Sichuan has not allowed for such re-education. But as the YCP makes moves to expand beyond the upper Yangtze, there may come a day where the Chinese people are enfranchised to guide their nation like the great river, running where it pleases towards the horizon."
 POLITICS_XIANG_DESC:0 "Liu Xiang is considered by many to be one of the 'Western Warlords'. Reailty however is quite different. Xiang's grip on Sichuan is quite weak, and Sichuan itself is tied to the South and its politics reflects this. The Guomindang has been trying to break into the province for years, with little success. If the warlord of Sichuan is hold onto his power however, he may have to bend to them one way or another. The Young China Party is an upstart group that resent his rule more than the Guomindang. His political survival depends upon ending Sichuan's dependence on Beijing."
