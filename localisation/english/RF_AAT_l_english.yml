 MNS.1.desc:0 "Two longtime friends and survivors held court, the Russian Republic burning behind them.\n\nFor Date Junnosuke, or Zhang Zongyuan to his compatriot, the past few weeks had meant success beyond his wildest dreams. State control had always been thin on the ground at the juncture between Mongolia and Manchuria - Japan growing more concerned with matters to the south and in the Home Islands meant no more oversight. And then the Russians…! Striking a thousand little blows for Pan-Asianism on the frontier was one thing, but the destruction of the Supreme Soviet clearly represented the beginning of the tide that would hurl the Europeans out of the continent.\n\nThe once-infamous Dogmeat General Zhang Zongchang, of course, had been biting his tongue whenever \"our natural partnership with Nippon\" came up. For him, Japan meant the destruction of his backers in the Fengtian Clique, and the start of the arduous march toward sobriety. While it had done nothing good for his temper, the old warlord had to admit the clarity of thought was welcome. For one, it had allowed him to see that joining Zongyuan on this quest would be better for his fortunes than being one general among many fighting over Mongolia.\n\nFurthermore, it allowed him to see that the bulk of the soldiers in their employ were essentially ethnic Chinese, and may find his thoughts on throwing the barbarians out of China more compelling than those of a Japanese puppet."
 MNS.1.a:0 "Removing the ronin would be too dangerous."
 MNS.1.b:0 "Zongchang's men gently dissuade the samurai."
 MNS_zhang_zongyuan_desc:0 "Zhang Zongyuan, another \"ronin\" seeking his path on the Asian continent, was born Date Junnosuke to a minor branch of the Date samurai clan. While his father was the governor of the Sendai Domain, and his grandfather served under the Emperor Meiji, his adolescence was inauspiciously messy. Narrowly having a prison sentence appealed down to probation after shooting a fellow youth in junior high, he would flit between multiple schools before dropping out of Waseda University. Prospects for the future looked questionable, until discussions with a Japanese spy and a Manchu prince dragged him into doing dirty work on behalf of the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\nDate's rap sheet, or service record depending on who you ask, criss-crosses the region. What started as brief involvement in a failed Manchu-Mongol Independence Movement to divide China and Zheltorossiya turned into involvement in multiple attempted assassinations - even against a Japanese Prime Minister in 1919. He also worked in operations against Korean bandits and nationalists for a few years before returning to China, where his objective of supporting regionalist movements against the Republic accidentally led to him becoming fast friends with Fengtien Clique general Zhang Zongchang. Date, in a fit of Pan-Asianist pique, changed his name and national identity to Chinese out of solidarity.\n\nWhen the Fengtien were obliterated, Zongyuan's networks in Shandong were disrupted as well, and he returned to operating within Japanese territory, plotting raids on Mongolia and Zheltorossiya. Unfortunately, Tokyo's attention being focused on domestic instability and the war with China meant that the would-be warlord was soon operating with very little oversight. Zongyuan was adventuring in Mongolia when Zheltorossiya broke apart, and the wayward noble saw an opportunity decades in the making. His youthful friendships with scholars such as Ikki Kita had potentially given his work an ideological character greater than simply supporting Japanese imperialism. Could Zheltorossiya be the new base area of Pan-Asian struggle? The world holds its breath as the ronin draws his sword once more."
 MNS_zhang_zongchang_desc:0 "Zhang Zongchang, what a life you have lived. Born in Shandong to an alcoholic barber/trumpeter and a folk exorcist, he was destined for an unusual childhood. When his parents divorced in his teens, he and his mother would move to Harbin, where Zhang made ends meet as a bouncer, pickpocket, and prospector. Moving further into Siberia for work, he would end up serving as an auxiliary in the Russian army during the war with Japan, then end up a marginally pro-revolution bandit upon his return to China. Through the vagaries of military politics, he found himself commanding a division in 1913 after his immediate superior was executed for disloyalty, then worked for almost a decade to avoid the same fate.\n\nJoining the Fengtien Clique in 1922, Zhang made a strong first impression on the warlord leadership in Manchuria. Perhaps it was his experience in the 1905 war, but he proved a capable commander who could utilize his connections in the Russian Far East to get ahold of armored trains, medical staff, and foreign military instructors. On the other hand, the Fengtien's involvement in the Chinese drug trade heralded the darker aspects of the eventually-dubbed Dogmeat General. After being ejected from governing Shanghai, he was assigned to be the military governor of his home province of Shandong, a period which would become infamous for violence and hedonistic depravity.\n\nWhile the Northern Expedition failed, and the Fengtien were one of the two strongest warlord powers left in the north, the fortunes of his Clique immediately took a turn for the worse. With his army recovering from the Guomindang's offensive, Zhang was unprepared for what would transpire next. Fearing that Zhang Zuolin's son was seeking terms with the GMD, Japan and the Shanxi Clique launched a lightning campaign that laid waste to the Manchurian power base of the faction. Bending like a reed in the wind, Zhang Zongchang went to Beijing to swear fealty to Yan Xishan, and with his diminished portfolio he was left largely to plot against the GMD and dream about what could have been.\n\nSeemingly destined for obscurity, and nursing a years-long hangover, Zhang was sent north on the expedition to Mongolia. Now, with the fall of Zheltorossiya, the once-infamous 72-Cannon Chang sees a chance at redemption. The remains of the Fengtien ride forth into what is rightfully Chinese territory, to prove themselves heroes or die in the attempt."
