 NOR_Tranmael_desc:0 "Although at the helm of the workers’ movement, Martin Tranmæl was in fact born to a middle-sized farmer in Melhus, near Trondheim. His childhood was a rather typical rural life - though Tranmæl, ever the bookworm, would sustain his mind on books borrowed from Melhus’s library, which, along with his father’s liberal beliefs, would influence him greatly. In 1893, however, his father lost ownership of the family farm, and the Tranmæl family entered precarious circumstances.\n\nIt was then that the young Tranmæl would enter the working class - first taking up painting lessons before becoming a construction worker in Trondheim. Initially a member of the temperance movement, he would soon join the Labour Party, helping to establish the newspaper Ny Tid in 1899, moving to the United States a year later. In his time in America, he would develop contact with the AFL and the IWW, and join the Socialist Party, shifting him towards a radical syndicalism. He brought this ideology home with him on his return to Norway in 1905, when the country was in its birth pangs. Gaining a reputation for fierce radicalism and fiery rhetoric, Tranmæl would often butt heads with the reformist elements of the labour movement. In 1911, as head of the Trade Union Opposition, Tranmæl would ally with radical left-wing elements of the Norwegian Labour Party’s youth wing to form the Trade Union Opposition of 1911, frequently known as the “Ungsosialisten” or “young socialists”.\n\nWhen the revolution came to Germany, Tranmæl appeared vindicated, with Labour moving further left and the Ungsosialisten in charge. Norway saw its red weeks soon after, in the mid-1920s, with the unions forming workers and soldiers’ councils to back yet as Germany entered the Levi years, Norway emerged divided between a reactionary and a socialist government. Edvard Bull presided over a Norway divided in two, both literally and figuratively, as political polarisation even reached the socialist movement. In 1932, following Bull’s death, it would be Tranmæl’s turn to take power."
 NOR_pole_star:0 "The Pole Star is Red"
 NOR_pole_star_desc:0 "It was not even two decades that we tasted independence before the Monarchist dogs and their Swedish handlers tried to subjugate us to Stockholm.  While we managed, with considerable sacrifices in blood and sovereignty, to cement the revolution, albeit with heavy German assistance, our lack of a decisive victory has loomed over us for the past decade.\n\nAs it currently stands, Bergen is the great North Star of the Rotfront.  An outpost in the frigid North kept warm by the fire of revolution.  We are a comet that courses through the chill of the boreal skies, thawing the reactionary freeze of the Northern races of Europe.  With every passing day, we gather momentum.  Aware of the steep challenges that face us, we nonetheless plunge forward into the revolutionary dawn, hoisting the red flag ever higher until all of Norway lies beneath its glow."
 NOR_direction:0 "The Old New Direction"
 NOR_direction_desc:0 "It is no secret that the Norwegian Revolution is an ongoing affair, not only in the thorny continual existence of the monarchists to our East, but also within our own territory.  Norway, much like our allies on the Southern end of the North Sea, is a laboratory for Socialism, and like many laboratory experiments, the variables do not always make a tranquil mixture.  Currently, much of the political energy in our society is concentrated in the debate between the Labour Party and unions, whose alliance forms much of the nation’s reigning political order, over who should hold supremacy.  The unions, who hold sway over the worker councils, are firmly in favor of a more syndical, German, style of governance, while the Labor Party remains doggedly committed to upholding parliamentary primacy.  While the counterrevolutionary threat to the East has done well in temporarily suturing these fissures in our government, the ongoing debate is something which must be resolved at some point, and there are no illusions that, however it ends, there will be clear winners and losers."
 NOR_rotten:0 "Something is Rotten"
 NOR_rotten_desc:0 "Gray, cold winds blow in from the mountainous crevices which thinly separate us from the fangs of reaction in Oslo.  This wind plays upon the subconscious of our people like a skeletal xylophone, a whisper of death that promises its presence in every corner, behind the eyes of close friends and mortal enemies.  In an attempt to snuff out this ubiquitous voice, we have brought to the forefront of our struggle the power of the firing line and prison cell.  In ever increasing droves victims of our suspicion have been quietly ushered into concrete buildings of no return.  None of this has done much to assuage our paranoia, the sword of damocles recedes for no amount of stuffed prisons or mass graves.  The wind continues to whisper, reciting our fears, pointing accusatory fingers."
