 BLR_DESC_MENU:0 "The Belarusian People's Republic was established on the threshold of the end of the Great War. From the beginning, the country faced corruption, illiteracy and dependence on what seemed like allies from the Intermarium. In the last years, the Hramada, the left-wing alliance ruling the country, began to fall into contradictions. Now, forces on both the extreme right and the extreme left have begun floating to miraculously heal the Republic. The centre of the party will be forced to take decisive action or wither away. Meanwhile, one question lingers like Damocles' Sword over all factions: in the coming struggle against the vicious Muscovites, will Belarus survive the future onslaught?"

Then, he looked to his left, where Roman Skirmunt, representing the Krajowcy faction, was putting up his best smile. Then, to his right, where Belarus' foreign minister, Piasecki, was sitting. Luckievich then turned back to the Polish guest and began the meeting.\n\n\"I appreciate your swift response to our invitation, Your Excellency. Belarus is a dear friend of Poland, but a friendship is nonetheless built on mutual respect. When one friend is in need, the other helps with no personal interest behind his actions.\"\n\nLuckievich was unsure of the coming reply. He tried his best to present his country as a loyal friend, but his mouth got ahead of him. He wondered what Roman Skirmunt was thinking. The Krajowcy basically forced him to accept Roman in the delegation. Such was the influence of political factions in Belarus, Luckievich thought. After the next elections were over, this had to be changed. But for now, he could do his best with the cards dealt. He could perhaps show to these 'patriots' what the President was made of.\n\n\"I understand what you mean, President Luckievich. As Poland's official representative, we offer our apologies. We meant no harm to you. We won't repeat this again. Let us bury this dispute and focus on the greater threats to our alliance. We will support Belarusian independence,  whatever the cost.\", said the Polish minister.\n\n\"The time for apologies is long gone, Your Excellency. This was not a sudden accident, your country has repeatedly influenced Belarus' politics ever since 1918. We are not doormats...We demand reparations from Warsaw, in the form of increased investments in our economy.\"\n\n\"Anton Ivanavic!\", spoke Roman Skirmunt on a harsh tone. He immediately turned to a diplomatic voice. \"Excuse my reaction, but this is too far! Our Polish friends have extended their hand in conciliation. We are better than this. We should be a model for other nations in maturity, not a blatant case of profiting from our allies' goodwill. I know what you feel, but ignore the nationalists' coming complaints about being Polish doormats. We are above their petty chauvinism. Let us be mature politicians, and not populist demagogues.\"\n\n\"I have to agree with Mr. Skirmunt.

Business continued as usual, deputies worked on their tasks and bureaucrats filled their papers. The new administration was yet to begin discussing the full implementation of its program. Today, the Rada was taken by storm. Debates over ethnic and cultural policy were announced, and contrary to everyone’s expectations, the once united bloc of the Krajowcy was tearing itself apart.\n\n“A new era begins for the brotherly nations of Belarus, my friends.”, began head of government Mikołaj Römer. “We leave behind the petty chauvinism that nearly led us into chaos in the first place. There are many enemies, internal and external, awaiting for the right moment to strike and tear this beautiful nation apart. With the old Grand Duchy in mind, we set out on a new road, one where Poles, Lithuanians, Russians, Belarusians, Jews will walk together-”\n\n“What is this travesty?”, interrupted Raman Skirmunt, the deputy around which the opposition rallied. “These senseless, mindless ideas of yours, of your whole faction, are just as dangerous as Tsarist subversion! The people of Israel have lived with us for centuries, but their nation is not here. This is the land of the Poles and their brothers, you must remember this!” Deputies around him began applauding their leader, shouting in his support. As the chants engulfed the room, Skirmunt continued his offensive. “As for the Grand Duchy, it is not just a model to play around with! It was a reality, one that remained imprinted in our psyches! Our goal here is not to just use its name for political advertisement.” He gesticulated towards his colleagues. “Most of us present here will agree with me. Our restoration must be made fact as soon as possible, and for that to happen, me and my colleagues humbly submit to vote a petition to crown Jan Pilsudski, relative of the deceased Marshal, as the new Grand Duke in over a hundred years!”.\n\nThe debate continued late into the night. Deputies exchanged heated words about who is and who is not a true national, judged the merits of the Pilsudski family to the whole Intermarium and made compromises on many other issues. As the hours passed, that morning’s deadlock was being moved over. Noddings of agreement and handshakes marked the reaching of a consensus. Among many of the deputies, the fact that the current government’s future depended on tonight’s outcome was clear.

How else could it be the brotherly peoples of the Intermarium?\n\n“On behalf of the Polish nation, we are happy to know your visit has been a happy one.”, smiled Polish foreign minister Janusz Radziwil. “Now onto some serious matters, I’m afraid. Your recent cabinet shuffle is not of worry to us, of course. But we can’t wonder what you set out to achieve. Your name does stand out and so does your program of defending local culture and restoring the Grand Duchy of old.”\n\n“Yes, Your Excellence”, replied Belarusian foreign minister Michael Romer. “The people of the Grand Duchy lived in harmony, without ethnic rivalry to break apart the beautiful life they had. You know well what happened. The Partitions, the uprisings, the Great War, and just recently the scandal in Ukraine! It’s so clear that once there was a force of good, and it must return back to life.”\n\n“Indeed.”, agreed Radziwiłł. “But the Duchy of Lithuania was not alone, you know. For a long time it was united with the Kingdom of Poland. They acted as one, fought as one. And now, the Intermarium.. Many here still believe in the return of the great Commonwealth, you must surely agree!”\n\nRomer took one second to reply, with his face turning into one of confusion. “I apologize, Your Excellency. This is … Not what we meant. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was a particular society, distinct from the Polish state. The Lithuanians, the Poles, the Ruthenians, even the Jews, they all lived under one roof, equally. I hope Your Excellency understands that we do not seek a return of the Commonwealth. The Poles would rule over everyone else. That is surely undesirable by anyone’s standards.”\n\nIt was Radziwill’s turn to wait a second to reply. “..Yes,I…We understand your concerns. Of course, I can't help but be surprised by this reaction. The new Commonwealth would be one brotherhood of equality, but we accept and we will respect your decision.

Pleased, Michael Romer then led the dignitaries to their cars. The motorcade then set off for Belarus’ capital proper.\n\nThe route was carefully chosen. Located outside the capital, the road to Minsk was the best way to showcase the government’s accomplishments in just a few kilometres. Passing by, Romer showed his esteemed guests tilled fields with modern tractors across them. Cars were now speeding on the recently paved roads. As they entered Minsk proper, the fields gave way to modern houses and apartments. The streets widened and trams made their way on them.\n\nOn the whole tour, Romer was careful to point out the diverse but distinctly Intermarine orientation of their projects. Machines from Poland were tilled by peasants both native and hailing from Lithuania and Belarus. Pakstas and Radziwil were clearly listening to him, taking note of all that was being shown to them. Belarus’ government put great effort into showing that they were not visiting one of Potemkin’s villages. Arriving at the Belarusian Rada, the delegation was greeted by a large popular gathering affirming the unity of Belarus and Lithuania within the former Grand Duchy’s space.

Before him lay a militia of peasants and soldiers hailing from the region around the village, assembled to cast out the agents of Tsarist aggression within their country.\n\nTheir target was a madman named Eliasz Klimowicz, who proclaimed himself Prophet and the second coming of Christ on Earth. From the church he was allowed to build decades ago, he said he could heal people with his powers, and many peasants would call up on his services. But behind this lay rumours of Russian agents using the establishment as a base of operations. Whatever the truth, Eliasz was a heretic whose teachings had no place in Belarus. If he truly harboured Tsarist agents, all the better if his nest of traitors was broken apart.\n\n“Come, brothers! Come!”, encouraged the priests and his faithful as they surrounded the damned temple. Eliasz Klimowicz and a few of his men were waiting for them, ready to stand with their church. “Eliasz Klimowicz, God Himself commands you to cease your abhorrent ways! Surrender now! No harm will come to you and your men! We know of your heresies and we know of the Russian spies you harbour! We know it was John of Kronstadt, the Tsar’s lackey, that let you build this place! But what the Muscovites put in place we will tear apart!”\n\nEliasz and his men saw themselves outnumbered but were still determined to fight. It was only when they saw the uniformed soldiers carrying guns that their faces dropped. The government itself sanctioned this persecution! Eliasz thought of the building that he laboured for so long, but then also thought of the men, women and children that had so much faith in him. Blood needn’t be spilled on holy grounds.\n\n“We surrender!”, he screamed. “Let no blood be spilled here!”\n\n“Very well!”, said a military officer. “We’ll make you a model of our leniency, to prove to you and your handlers in Petrograd that we are far away from the orcs you make us to be!

Perhaps they didn’ even look each other in the eyes, if they had any. But one did reach out for a package in its coat, which the other accepted and silently opened. There was the money promised, which the shadow carefully counted. Pleased, it put the package within its own coat, shook the other shade’s coat, and returned to the darkness it came from.\n\nThe same night, at the border of the same town, a man was working in the fields late at night. This man was named Vatslav Lastouski, and he was no ordinary farmer. He was a renowned political leader in Belarus and in its leading party, the Hramada. Some time ago, he tried his luck at securing power over the country in the name of its peasants’ future, but his bet failed. With it came a degree of isolation from the renewed halls of power, but Vatslav found comfort in this. A peasants’ leader did not need the gentlemens’ approval, he needed to work the soil with his brethren.\n\nA shadow was watching Vatslav that night. In the silent darkness, that shadow was immune to his humane instincts. That shadow observed the man taking a break and heading to the shed near him, a shed covered in utter dark. The poor Lastouski made his life’s mistake by trespassing into the shadowy realm, and he would not live to regret it. The shadow swiftly approached him and took his soul with him. The next morning, the other farmers found his body impaled in the stored equipment, with no sign whatsoever of the encounter that happened last night."

I mean, not even he was going to in this situation.\n\nThe Ukrainian farmer went back to thank the crew that helped transport his equipment to his new home.\n\n“It is what it is. Thanks, boys.”, he sighed. “Here’s your money.”\n\n“Thank you, Stepan. What’s with the long face?”, replied Nykyfor, the crew’s chief.\n\n“Why did they lie to me? They told me the soil’s all good. That so many other peasants got land here and they loved it. I left my family in Odesa for nothing!”\n\n“Oh, Stepan! Have you taken a shovel to check the land for yourself?”\n\nTaken by surprise, Stepan did as he was told. He took the shovel and began digging. Then he realised how wrong he was about the land he was allotted. It was black, the blackest land he has ever seen! Proper farming soil! Stepan began jumping of joy, smiling at Nykyfor who could only give him a nod of approval. Stepan’s life was not over, no. It was only getting started. He could almost feel the harvests filling his barn. He dropped to the ground and began embracing the earth however he could. The land, oh, the land! His land! And the crops that will sprout from his seeds.."

Across the Dnieper, we have waited for two decades to finally free you, weeping at the fact of your oppression.” Applauses and smiles make themselves known from the initially apathetic listeners.\n\n“Now, brothers and sisters in Christ, is the time for reconstruction and regeneration. Smolensk joins its brethren cities of Minsk, Brest and Mogilev wearing its new Belarusian dress. But our friends do not end at our borders. We are part of the great Intermarium alliance, without which our liberation would have been impossible.

The reports of violence between Poles and Lithuanians threw the Grand Duchy’s strongest supporters into unseen chaos, and this showed itself in today’s meeting.\n\n“Full and unconditional support to our brother Poles!”, proclaimed one Piotr Dzikowski. “These Lithuanian nationalists, they are evil, very evil people. Remember Mikhnovsky? Remember the discord that Ukrainian chauvinism sowed? Here we are, reaping its harvest.”\n\nThe men around him rose in applause for his display of unrepentant Polish patriotism. This was the most eloquent display of the most natural reaction one would have to seeing your countrymen under attack. With the power bestowed upon them, they had to take up their cause and defend it with full vigour. Today, Piotr Dzikowski did just that.\n\n“Brothers, brothers!”, resonated a voice from another side of the hall. “We must not follow those bad apples in Lithuania in succumbing to such spiteful rhetoric.” Piatro Šuškievič rose from his chair, trying to cover with his voice the wild reactions coming from Dzikowski’s side.\n\n“We are the Krajoŭcy. We are not here just for Poland or for Lithuania. We are here to serve and protect all the peoples living in the Intermarium. Taking one side won’t solve anything, instead we’ll plunge the whole region into this tragic crisis.” Šuškievič knew all delegates were now listening to him. “Patriots! We must unite under the banner of our beliefs, now more than never! This is our first true test! Will we pass it, or will our idea falter in the wind?”\n\nHis own side was the one chanting and praising. Piotr Dzikowski himself was silent, while some of his newfound allies were chanting about a lack of real patriotism. The Krajoŭcy were now facing an unprecedented crisis, and so far their response has been to fight against each other. Time was rapidly moving in Minsk, and in Vilnius and Warsaw as well. A resolution will be found one way or another, and depending on that, the Krajoŭcy’s dreams of unity would materialise or remain relegated to the world of imagination."

Suddenly, the Krajoŭcy were reunited under one banner, sensing the opportunity at hand.\n\n“I am speaking for all of us today, that this is a blessing.”, declared [BLR.GetLeader]. “Chauvinism failed to take root, while the spirit of brotherhood prevailed! Representatives, friends, we must send our very own delegation to Vilnius to propose a federation between Belarus and Lithuania!”\n\nThe hall was full of applause. This was the day they were waiting for! The Krajoŭcy talked of  the unity of the old Grand Duchy of Lithuania eventually prevailing. Only the blind could not see how they were right all along! Hope and joy was in every deputy present at the meeting, and surely in all their supporters across the country.\n\nThe Rada proceeded to vote on the legation they were to send to Vilnius. Their best men were to travel there and prove that history itself vindicated their course of action. They had to be quick, though. Lithuanian and Polish nationalists were not done with desiring Lithuania just for themselves, and if they were not countered in time, all the efforts put into securing the peace and conducting the negotiations would end up wasted."

Decades later, the very same group of men and women, along with children of their own, have come together to smash the pests once more.\n\nThe sack was pulled from Roman Skirmut’s head, the bright sun pierced his eyes as he attempted to get his bearings. He had been fully stripped of his clothing and strung to an effigy he could only guess was styled after him. He looked around frantically, attempting to grasp any sense of familiarity, when it hit him. His entire village was gathered in front of him, all his possessions laid in a pile just below him. A man approached him, donning what was previously Roman’s finest suit, which was clearly too large for the man. The man turned to the crowd and cleared his throat:\n\n“Today is the day! Today we take back what is ours!”\n\nThe crowd cheered as Roman felt their appetite growing. The man knelt down and grabbed a random assortment of valuable looking objects, throwing them into the crowd.\n\n“For far too long we have been kept down by this insect!”\n\nThe man turned towards Roman, and continued:\n\n“For this he will face certain extinction.”\n\nHe hurled a small statuette at Roman, striking his sternum. As Roman attempted to catch his breath the man invited the crowd to follow in his suit. With every blow, Roman felt a piece of him die. As he looked back up to the sun, he felt its glow get brighter with every moment that passed, until it engulfed him entirely, where he felt nothing at all."

Ahead of him was a series of meetings with the various arms of government he had so dutifully put together, the first of which being with the head of the archaeological projects he had called for. As he embarked on his morning commute he wondered what it is they may have found, was this the day they finally unearth the secrets of Kryvia? The ancient empire certainly existed, it was just a matter of proving it.\n\nAs he arrived on the site he could see the supervisor talking to a group of excavators before ushering them away.\n\n“Right on time, Mr. Lastouski!”\n\nThe man was clearly nervous, his hands shook, his brow drenched in sweat, and most apparent of all, he had seemingly forgotten how to tie his tie.\n\n“Good morning Sergey, I expect you have good news for me.”\n\nSergey winced, aimlessly flipping through the pages on his clipboard,“Aha yes! About that sir… we’ve reviewed our findings extensively, and it appears there simply are none.”\n\nLastouski stared blankly at the man, it was as if he had been completely reset, all emotion having left his face. He stood like this for what felt to Sergey like forever, until suddenly springing right back into action:\n\n“I understand, it’s really no wonder if you think about it!”\n\nSergey breathed a sigh of relief, feeling as if a mountain had been lifted from atop him. Lastouski continued:\n\n“Their artifacts must have been wooden! Though their empire was mighty we cannot expect them to have known of metal or concrete. Their remnants have simply been swallowed by the earth, leaving us the torch with which to rebuild anew!”\n\nSergey blinked what must have been twenty times, trying to process what the most powerful man in the country had just told him."

The difference between the two men was like night and day; the young man might easily have been mistaken for a Berliner, his clothes clean and his hair neatly trimmed. The other man donned a patchy burlap overcoat, his hair, or what was left of it, was unkempt and dirty, his face covered in soot and grime. The boy continued:\n\n“Have you familiarized yourself with Chairman Lastouski’s new electoral reforms?”\n\nThe old man turned to face the boy, his eyes sunken and weary, eventually muttering.\n\n“Lastouski’s what?”\n\n“His electoral reforms, sir! You know, voting and all that.”\n\nThe peasant looked at the boy, puzzled.\n\n“I don’t do any of that.”\n\nThe boy’s eyes lit up, clearly having gotten the exact reaction he was hoping for.\n\n“But that’s just it sir! For the first time in your life you’ll be able to participate in our new socialist government, the constitution says so!”\n\n“Listen kid, I appreciate the moxy but I’m just too old for all of this politics. Say, shouting all day, surely you’ve worked up an appetite, yeah?”\n\n“I- Yeah, I guess I could eat.”\n\nWithout another word, the peasant beckoned the boy to walk with him. The peasant’s home was only a few minutes walk from the town square, a single open room with ramshackle furniture dotted across the space. Though it was quaint, it was enough for him and his family, so long as they had each other."

Radicals such as Lastouski, Chizevsky and Bosch have made inroads in the assembly halls of our peoples and of our very party, gathering adherents to their heresies.

On the other side, there’s the Green Oak clique within the army under the Ksyanevich brothers.

The roots of this disease have been traced to the just as unpatriotic Orthodox priests who delusionally preach that our nation is in fact a creation of the Devil himself.

Unlike the reactionaries, they can listen to our reasoning. For once, we may go to an opposition force not with guns or bribes, but with a good word.

As tragic as this is, we must imprint it to our mindset and adapt to the circumstances. If we are Europe’s defenders, we should live up to that name. How to do that? For the past years, we have worked with the Poles and the Germans to raise Belarus out of the mud. All comes at a cost, and that has been the expansive presence of Polish influence within our borders. We must do something about it, or otherwise we’ll have simply sold Russian domination for Polish hegemony. Some voices in our administration paint a different picture. The Krajowcy, as they call themselves, want us to play smart and use Polish domination in new, innovative ways. Their talk about Intermarine unity and people’s brotherhood may sound dangerous, but to certain ears it’s sounding like the solution to our woes."

Even worse, the profitors of that exchange were the very elites that have since found themselves inside our borders. Action must be taken against them, but our hands in this urgent matter are shockingly bound to Warsaw’s reaction. Were we to be too harsh in our coming campaigns, Poland would strongly react against persecuting those who still are ethnic Poles, after all. And if we were to be too lenient with this vermin, it would find its way to the ranks of the Krajowcy, the faction that has always been glad to welcome our unhappy aristocrats in its ranks.

But it is their very reputation that has given them such a prominent place in our movement, and with it more talk about the supposed Kryvich Empire and its spaceships made of wood that thousands of years ago reigned supreme.

This moment of Polish grief is our chance to turn the tables and put us on par with Ukraine.

Millions of oppressed brothers beg to be set free from the suffering they have to go through each day just by living within Russia’s borders.

Our position is not as desperate however, so our approach can be a lighter one. We do not seek to end democracy and install a dictatorship, as it would be no more than a betrayal of our interests. Instead, in the name of the very democracy we seek to protect, we must go beyond just purging corrupt officials within the party.

Bolshevism, Neo-Paganism, ruthless Capitalism and many other such practices must be kept away from Belarus, away from our pious people. And Hramada knows that the best way to ensure our people's loyalty to our Christian teachings is to strike at the landowners who keep all land and money to themselves, preying on orphans and widows while forcing themselves to give barely a penny to their employees. We shall take away their privileges and give their wealth back to the people who deserve it, letting everyone know that ruthless collectivism is not the only and not the best way to ensure people's dominion over their own labour."

It is also clear that classical liberal democracies serve only the capitalist class and not the interest of the nation.\n\nTrying to further justify our nation will be useful as it builds our legitimacy, but nothing more.
