Hans Huttig, the candidate of the white minority, is militaristic and violent, almost abusive towards his subordinates, but is an otherwise intelligent and powerful man. Louis Brody, the candidate of the natives and the educated blacks, is a Hessian celebrity born in Cameroon, that seeks to establish a welfare state in the Congo. Who does Ebermaier pick?"

 pcn.7.title:0 "Reaching the Ocean"
 pcn.7.desc:0 "Major Bittenfeld took a deep breath of the fresh sea air, spending a moment simply savoring it. It wasn't cool, exactly, but after a decade spent in the fetid jungle, the steady motion of the air was refreshing in a way words utterly failed to describe.\nHe looked down from his rooftop, toward the swiftly growing port of Neu Wilhelmshaven. It'd had some other name, before they'd arrived - banana or something. He couldn't believe the Belgians would have kept the name, but given what had become of them, maybe that was to be expected.\nRegardless, even with the construction unfinished, the port was already being put into the service of the true German nation. A large ocean liner had tied up alongside one of the newly-constructed quays, and a steady stream of people were disembarking from it. Despite the distance, Bittenfeld had no need for his field glasses to identify the newcomers. They were German exiles, only a tiny fraction of those now scattered across the world, forced to abandon their homes and flee one step ahead of death at the hands of the red mob. Some would hail from the countries of Mitteleuropa, while others would be coming from Sudwestafrika or South America.\nTied up on the next berth was a cargo ship, clearly an older vessel, but the real value was what it carried. Machine tools, electrical generators, precision-cast steam turbine blades, and a dozen other bespoke technical artifacts besides. Everything they needed to bring the Hessian Congo into the modern age. He'd heard some discussion of the old Belgian studies of the hydroelectric potential of the lower Congo river - enough to power all of Old Germany, some said.\nRaising his field glasses, Bittenfeld scanned the column of arrivals snaking down the quay. His gaze lingered on a girl, who shaded her eyes as she looked around in excitement, and the little boy holding a small suitcase standing next to  her. That was what they'd spent so long in the Jungle fighting for - but also precisely what their new state needed to revitalize itself.\nHe took another deep breath of the bracing sea air. Their struggle in the jungle had been worthwhile… but he also really didn't want to go back. Bittenfeld looked back at the ocean and furrowed his brow. If they had a port, their new state would need a navy, surely. And given what they had to work with, he doubted their new §iZentralafrikageschwader§! could be too picky.\nBittenfeld smiled. Maybe it was time to transfer his commission."
